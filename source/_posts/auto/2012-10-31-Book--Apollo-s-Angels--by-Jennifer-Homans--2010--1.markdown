I read most of the first chapter today, although I decided it was
a bit long and I should break my reading into smaller chunks. It
was very interesting to read about the philosophical origins of
the art. The idea that entertainment before was more loud and that
ballet was distinguished by silence is cool. The Feuillet notation
is crazy to read... it looks so meaningless to me. The debate
about whether dance should be considered part of music is curious,
especially given modern university organization. Finally, reading
about all the ways male dance was preferred to female dance is
very strange to a modern, such as myself.
