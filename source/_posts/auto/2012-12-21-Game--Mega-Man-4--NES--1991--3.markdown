In the middle of the day, I played this and beat Ring Man and
Dust Man. Ring Man's level was quite difficult and Dust Man was
really tough to fight himself. 

At night, I went through the rest of the game and beat it. I
found this game to be much much harder than the other ones. I
think one thing that made it so difficult was that when you died
against a boss in the Wily stages, you had to do the end of the
level again. The 2nd form of the Wily Machine was really
brutal. It took me so long to even be able to hit him at all. I
watched a few YouTube videos and still couldn't do it. I think it
took about 45 minutes of fighting over and over again.

Total time: 4:34
