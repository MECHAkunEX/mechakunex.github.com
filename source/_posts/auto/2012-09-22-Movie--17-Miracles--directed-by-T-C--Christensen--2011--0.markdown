This was a really nice movie. I felt like crying before the title
screen was even up. I cried a lot during the movie and found it
very uplifting. There were some problems with it... mainly that I
think a lot of assumes too much pre-existing knowledge about what
happened, rather than explaining it in the movie; particularly
with regard to the rescue. But it was an awesome movie.
