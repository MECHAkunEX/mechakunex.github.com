I played through Portal over
the last little bit. The game is really clever and unique. The
puzzles were nothing quite like I've experienced before and the
story is clever. I love the idea that you break out of a puzzle
game and use your skills "against" the game in the "real
world".

Definitely a great and memorable game.
