We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool "abilitease". I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I've
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn't realize it. But
now, it's quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It's cute so far though.

Total time: 1:07
