I played and beat this tonight. Last time I played, I could barely
get past the first level because it is so brutal and you need to
grind, but it's practically impossible. This time, I tried to use
a code that gave more hearts per heart icon you got, but it didn't
really help. I used a password that gave me more levels and that
made a big difference. The hardest part of the game was the third
fortress, because it was so complex of a labyrinth. It's a fun
game... a little too floaty jumps and the inability to scroll
backward is bit rough, but for an old game it has pretty decent
mechanics. Although it is a classic in my memory, it's systems
don't live up to being a real classic.

Total time: 1:47
