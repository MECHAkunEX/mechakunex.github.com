Yesterday I played Bonk's Adventure for the PC Engine (or
TurboGrafx-16.) The beginning of the game was very fun and
straight-forward, but once you get to the final level the
difficulty ramps up to an insane degree. It starts with a tunnel
in the water where there are spikes on the top and the bottom and
I have no idea how to get through without just spending multiple
lives to get through it. After that, there is a huge level full of
Mega Man-style disappearing blocks. Then there's basically a boss
rush where you face all the previous bosses then two final bosses,
which are both insane. Nevertheless, the game was fun, but crazy
at the end. I got 66,080 points. Word.
