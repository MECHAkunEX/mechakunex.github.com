I played today for almost three hours and beat the game. I beat
levels 6, 7, and 8 as Maria. Then, I beat 8 as Richter. Then I
beat 4' as Richter to get to 5'. I did 5' as Maria (and continued
on to beat the game on the same continue.)

When I finally beat Dracula as Richter, I wasn't hit at all in his
human form, but was hit just once in his giant man-bat form (by
the blue energy wave, that I think you are supposed to duck
under.)

This is a very satisfying game to beat. I will definitely
continue playing it in the future... especially since I invested
in a PC Engine to be able to play it. It's a blast.

Although... I'm annoyed that I only have 96% completion on the
save screen... despite having done everything in the game. I'm not
sure what I'm supposed to do to bring it to 100%.

Total time: 7:28
