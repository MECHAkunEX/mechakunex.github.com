Today I played for a little less than four hours. I went from the
Duke's Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good... still hard because you've got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up...
it's all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow... just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.

I "love" seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.
