I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.

I find it very strange that if the Capitol is "surrounded" by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia... i.e. very far away... how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.

Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.
