My son asked for this game today (rather than the next game in our
sequence, Mega Man 4.) So I played it for about an hour. I
couldn't beat any levels, but I fought Freeze Man and Cloud Man a
few times and got all the secret items on their stages. I think I
need to invest in Energy Tanks prior to a boss battle.

Total time: 0:51
