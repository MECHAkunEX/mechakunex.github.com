I played this for about an hour and a half. It's a very
intriguing game. 

It's like a normal platforming game, but after you beat the first
level, you are thrust into a weird RPG-like world. You wander
around talking to people and getting little side-quests.

When you are in the overworld, you can get into random battles
that are like Zelda 2---tiny side-scrolling segments---where you
have to defeat all the enemies to escape. There's no experience
or progress system, other than receiving items which power you
up.

I got about half-way through the game (according to a FAQ) and
got a lot of interesting power-ups: breaking blocks, jumping
higher, flying longer, etc.

It was interesting, but it is very hard to enjoy Gameboy games (my
eyes bleed), especially on the emulator I was using because it
would get laggy a bit too often. I think I will try the NES game
and definitely the SNES game in this series. I have high hopes for
the SNES game.

Total time: 1:14
