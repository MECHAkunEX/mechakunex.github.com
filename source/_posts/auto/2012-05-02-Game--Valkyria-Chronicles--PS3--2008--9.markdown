I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.

The story is getting really neat and touching. I can't believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to "avenge" her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she'll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&D area, so I suspect that it really isn't
that close to being done.

This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It's very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.
