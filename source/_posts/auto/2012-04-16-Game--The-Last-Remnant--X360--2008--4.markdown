I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I'm in an area
now with just one person in my group and it's quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I'm
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.

Total time: 7:48
