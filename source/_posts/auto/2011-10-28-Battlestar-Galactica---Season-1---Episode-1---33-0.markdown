I really like how tragic this show is. My favourite form of drama
is tragedy and I think one of the reasons is that I like it when
circumstances go as low as imaginable, but then people persevere
and are heroic. This episode had that in spades. I almost cried
at a few parts. I really enjoyed the joy at the new baby at the
end. The idea of the whiteboard where every human is tracked is
brilliant.

One thing I wonder about the world of the show is whether there
was a time when the Twelve Colonies did not know about each
other. Did they have a pre-radio technology era, or were they
colonized with advanced space technology and mostly stayed at
that complexity for a long time?
