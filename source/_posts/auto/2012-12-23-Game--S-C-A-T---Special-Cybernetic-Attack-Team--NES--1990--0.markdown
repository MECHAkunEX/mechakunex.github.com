I played this game until the boss of the third stage. I used one
continue on the first stage getting to know the systems; I used
another at the beginning of stage two and stage three; then I got
to the boss of stage three and died. Stage three was incredibly
painful on the eyes because the background scroll so much.

The game was a very competent shooter from that era, with the
standard complaints for someone that loves CAVE. The idea that you
are person is kind of cute and the rotating options are neat
too. But, the game doesn't have enough distinctive to feel
special.
