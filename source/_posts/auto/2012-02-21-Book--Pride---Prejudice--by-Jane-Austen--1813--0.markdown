I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.

My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.

I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
"action", but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That's
what I like most about it... you feel like you are there and they
are real.

I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else's income and how public it is. I don't think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.
