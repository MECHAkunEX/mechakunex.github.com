My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that *could* happen given the way she's set it up.

Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.
