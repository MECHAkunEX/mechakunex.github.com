The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.

I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.

I can't imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there's no doubt about
that, but I'm not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.
