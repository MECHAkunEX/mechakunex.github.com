I played through Dragon Warrior 3 over the past week and a half.

My opinions on this game are very similar to DW1 and DW2. This
much more mechanically strong that DW2 but not as much of a leap
as DW2 was over DW1. I enjoyed the class changing system.

I used anti-grinding Game Genie codes to limit the amount I had to
do it---one gave me more XP and the other more GP. The combat
system gets pretty old, especially with random monsters. Fighting
the bosses is typically really fun.

I also played with a guide, so I didn't have to figure out where I
needed to go myself, but I got the impression that it was much
less obscure than DW2, but not as clear as even a SNES-era game.

For these two reasons, I definitely didn't get a true DW3
experience, although I'm willing to bet that I wouldn't want that
experience. Instead, I just enjoyed the story.

The connection to the other games is easily the coolest part of
this and really comes out of nowhere, but makes complete sense
after the fact. I thought it was also really cool how you run into
your father right at the end. It's really neat.

I'm looking forward to the first truly played DW game.
