I played for a lot today as I rested from being sick. There some
pretty memorable moments: I loved the joke about why one family
had been in charge of guarding the forbidden gate for so long. I
was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to say "No" to the
Count or console Callista... the romantic comedy structure is
really being forced on me. I find the establishment of Mirania as
this character with a weird "food" quirk to be pretty
hilarious. I'm still really enjoying this game.
