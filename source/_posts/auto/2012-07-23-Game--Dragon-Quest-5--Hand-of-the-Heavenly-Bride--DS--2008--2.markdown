Tonight I made a lot of progress and saved the kingdom. It was
fun. I started exploring the new continent. I had a really hard
time with fighting the giant cat. I could tell there was some
trick but couldn't tell what it would be. It was annoying to have
no clue. I played for like two hours.

Total time: 8:48
