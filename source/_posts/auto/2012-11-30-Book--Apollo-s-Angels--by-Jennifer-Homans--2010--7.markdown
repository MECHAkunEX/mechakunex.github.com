This whole chapter seems to be about Marie Taglioni and she sounds
amazing.

If Vestris designed the steps that became modern ballet, she
figured out how to do them with the style expect of modern
ballerinas. She did everything that Vestris did, but she practiced
so long and hard to achieve the strength necessary to do it in an
"elegant" and "feminine" way. While the early dancers were
"sweaty" and "breathless" when they did them, she was
"angelic". She built this technique over 6 months after a failed
start in Vienna by working for 6 hours a day and holding poses for
100 seconds.

Her shoes are still extant and have been studied. While she
performed full pointe, she mainly held herself at full point and
did not dance on it. We know this because her shoes were not the
boxed and hard style that allows that. Instead, by looking at the
wearing at the shoes, it looks like she danced about half-way
between half-pointe and full-pointe. Her dancing was so powerful
that she used 2 or 3 shoes per performance.
