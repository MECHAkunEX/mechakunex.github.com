I listened to the [Crunk Games](http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380) Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.
