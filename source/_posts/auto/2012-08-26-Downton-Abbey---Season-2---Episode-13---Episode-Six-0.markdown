This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.
