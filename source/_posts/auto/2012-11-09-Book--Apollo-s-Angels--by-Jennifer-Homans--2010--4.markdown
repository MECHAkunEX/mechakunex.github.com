It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like "plays" but
should be like "paintings", because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can't express detailed, dynamic
stories... everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable... like a painting.
