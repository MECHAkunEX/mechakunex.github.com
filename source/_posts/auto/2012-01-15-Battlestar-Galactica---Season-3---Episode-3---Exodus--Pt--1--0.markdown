I'm glad things worked out with the cliffhanger from the last
episode. I'm very curious about what's going on with the babies
and all that. I really have no confidence with if the rescue will
succeed. If it doesn't, then what is going to happen to the
fleet, just die? If it does, then they're back to what the show
was before without much exploration of what could have been
really interesting. It seems strange to end the New Caprica
sequence so quickly.

One thing I wondered during this episode was... what were the
Cylons originally for? Were they war robots? Did they do
everything... like normal jobs? What were the circumstances of
the original rebellion. Very curious.
