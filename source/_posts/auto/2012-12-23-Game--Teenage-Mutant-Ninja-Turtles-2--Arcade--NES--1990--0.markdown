I played this game sooo much when I was a kid. I enjoyed
beat-em-ups and this one in particular to play with friends.

I played tonight for the whole first level and then died on the
boss. It was incredibly rote and there weren't even exciting
graphics or satisfying punching like in Streets of Rage. I feel
like this genre of game is so easy to replace with better
versions that put all the old ones to shame.
