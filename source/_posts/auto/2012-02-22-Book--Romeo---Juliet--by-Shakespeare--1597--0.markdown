I started reading this because Ayame's class in school was. I
greatly enjoy it. The little poems in the first half are so cute
and clever. I'm now in Act III and I don't like it as much, but I
recognize its necessity for the tragedy of the first two Acts to be
realized. I just read Act III/Scene II and it is curious how
casually Juliet talks about having sex with Romeo that night to
seal their marriage.
