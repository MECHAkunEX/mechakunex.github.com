This was a really cool episode. In broad strokes, I was correct
about what the setup of the new show is. I was very happy with
the special touches that I would have never thought of. The most
exciting, probably being what is going on with Starbuck. But
overall, it was awesome. I can totally see this show remaining
amazing.

It is very interesting to see the show as an allegory about the
US relation to the Muslim world. Religious conflict. Overwhelming
force. Chasing down rebels. Trying to force our help on them even
if they don't want it. Etc. I'm sure it doesn't all work out, but
the first episode of this show with the hero being a suicide
bomber is pretty obvious point in that direction.
