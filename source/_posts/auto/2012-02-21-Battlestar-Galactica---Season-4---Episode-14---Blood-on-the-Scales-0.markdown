This was a really great closing to the rebellion. I liked that
Gaius seemed to recognize the importance of his religious role. I
hope this will be a sign that he will take it more seriously, and
perhaps that it will signify the next plot arc in the show. It
was also interesting that Tory seemed to be in charge of the
Cylons, presumably because she is one of the Five, so they
respect her, and she embraces her Cylon nature. It is also
interesting that Tyrell basically saved the fleet. I hope that
Laura realizes it is basically her fault that this happened
because she refused her responsibilities as President. I was also
reminded in this episode that nothing really ever came of the
mutiny on the Demetrius. Strange.
