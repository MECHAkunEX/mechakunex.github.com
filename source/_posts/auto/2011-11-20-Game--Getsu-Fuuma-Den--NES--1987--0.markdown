This is another game that I got with my Famicom for free. This is
a very intriguing game. It feels like a mix of the original
Castlevania games with the multiple area/free-form system of Order
of Ecclesia. After playing it for about 30 minutes, I put down in
my database that I'd like to try it again. The mechanics are
strong enough, although there seem to be a bit too many annoying
sinusoidal enemies. We'll see.
