/Best game ever!/

I can't believe how good this game is. Seriously. I'm in
shock. Play it; stop reading and play it now. I bought an Xbox 360
for the sole purpose of this game and don't regret it at all.

I was worried that it would be too easy and I would get annoyed
('cause I only like hard old-school games), so I played it on
Insane (the hardest difficulty) from the start. This mode was
clearly intended to be played after you had done a few
play-throughs and unlocked the golden weapons and gotten high
levels. Until the very end of the game when you get the Inertia
Element and the Fusion Helmet and you reach around level 40, the
game is basically a stealth game. Even with full health upgrades,
you can die almost instantaneously in most rooms. I loved this
though. The very next day after beating it at 100% map and 100%
items, I immediately started again. I love it.
