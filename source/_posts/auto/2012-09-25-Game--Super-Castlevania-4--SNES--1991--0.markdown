I showed this game to my son and got to block 3-2 on one
continue. I died once on Medusa, because I had been sloppy
earlier in the level and then the rest of the deaths came from
bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)

Total time: 0:29
