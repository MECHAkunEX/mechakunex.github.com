I've been playing Desktop Dungeons every few days for about two
months. I was able to get through the normal mode easily with the
Fighter and the advanced version of the Fighter, but I haven't
been able to with any other classes---I've tried the next Fighter
and the Thief, mainly the Thief. I feel like the game's random
creation engine is flawed and creates un-beatable dungeons. For
example, in the last one I did, I beat every enemy and was only
level 8, but the boss is always level 10 and indestructible. I've
decided to stop playing because of this... I gave it many chances,
but every play session is becoming too rote. Initially, I thought
it was very cool because it flet like a roguelike, but was very
bite-sized. I think the idea is still good, but needs to be
refined.
