This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements--for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I'm glad they didn't kill any kids.)

There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to "Kill all
STARS" and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis' display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.

Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements---something that is actually kind of rare---I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel... a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.

Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.

I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.

Overall, I can't say I like this. [Roger Ebert's review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023) is funny;
"The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children."
