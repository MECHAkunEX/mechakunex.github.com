It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)

Total time: 5:02
