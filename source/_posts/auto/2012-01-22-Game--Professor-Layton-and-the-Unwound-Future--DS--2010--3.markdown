The last puzzle game I played each day was Professor Layton and
the Unwound Future. I started on July 28th and I finished the main
story by December 28th and then completed all the optional content
yesterday.

This is easily the best story of any of the Layton games I've
played. The puzzles are definitely on par with the
others. Although I must say that I feel like there were more
"action" puzzles where you play a little puzzle-like mini-game. I
like these quite a bit, actually.

Very great game.
