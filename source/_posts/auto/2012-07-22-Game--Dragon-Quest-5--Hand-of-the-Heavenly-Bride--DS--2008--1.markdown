I played for like three hours today at various times. I got
through the next few adventures and now I've escaped from the
slave camp and I'm trying to get Coburg back in order. I really
enjoy the story in this Dragon Quest. It does a really good job of
making you feel like your dad is really strong and cares about
you. It's neat. I feel like there's a lot of cute foreshadowing
going on too.
