I played for like two hours today. I fought and won against
Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen's Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I'm supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.
