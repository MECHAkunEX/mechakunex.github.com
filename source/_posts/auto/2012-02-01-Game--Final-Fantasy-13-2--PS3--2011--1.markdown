Omega wrecked me. The video opening sequence is pretty cool. The
time anomalies are cute little puzzles. My strategy is to have
Serah be primarily Ravager and Noel primarily Commando. Their
primary role is N, their secondary is N/2, and their others is
N/4. All the monsters are at level N/4 as well. I don't know if
this is a very good strategy. I am slightly worried that it won't
be possible to max out every level, but then I realized that the
level on the status screen is just the maximum level of any
role... I think at least. [004:56:03 (31/28) (8/160)]
