We played for about two hours and beat the rest of the factory
levels. We discovered a way to grind for balloons but decided not
to. We traded our time for just using a cheat code that gives
infinite balloons. It's amazing how much more fun the game is
now, because we can play a little less cautiously and give my
wife more opportunities to do the difficult platforming sequences
where she used to just climb on my back. I think that might be
why we liked Mario so much more, because the Desert Life grind is
so effective.
