I still need to get a gold on the Formula GT expert race (I
currently have a silver) and the rest of the special events. I've
decided to not do the A-Spec Endurance races at all, because they
are insulting. I tried doing the GT race this morning, but had
monkeys climbing all over me... which was very difficult.
