I played three rounds and got to the boss of the first area both
times. This game is ridiculously bad. The controls are terrible
and basic mechanics are broken. For example, there's no period of
invulnerability when you get hit and you get stunlocked in
place. There were times when I missed a jump, landed on an enemy,
and slowly lost all my health as I couldn't move away.

I remember playing this game as a kid, but I don't remember every
getting past the first stage. I guess I never will.

Total time: 0:10
