The kiddo wanted to have me play this today because he likes Cut
Man so much. I creamed Cut Man: one death on the way, one death at
the fight. Next we did Ice Man I got through the disappearing
blocks really easily, but fell off on the floating platforms and
got a Game Over. Then it was time to give the monkeys lunch.
