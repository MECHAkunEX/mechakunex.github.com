I saw this right when it came out, in the theatres, before my first
baby was born. It was awesome then and was awesome this time
too. Heath Ledger really is amazing in it. I like how tough Bruce
Wayne is and he acts quite nobly too. I was a little surprised by
how Harvey Dent acts, it seems a little more un-natural watching it
the second time. I also remembered the scenes in Hong Kong being
more awesome... they were cool, but not as crazy. I love the alibi
of taking all the ballerinas on a cruise. So funny.
