[Joystiq](http://feeds.joystiq.com/~r/weblogsinc/joystiq/~3/J72px2lMtpU/) - He mentions some appalling music tracks: agree. He
doesn't like Chocobolina: I agree, but I also don't care. He
thought it was hard: I disagree. I don't think his review is very
deep.

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml) - I like the review.

[Kotaku](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/excerpts/~3/2gL3kyCtDGw/final-fantasy-xiii%2B2-the-kotaku-review) - Also like it

[Edge](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/) - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won't get
you that.

[Christian Nutt in Gamasutra](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php) - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn't need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?

[2D-X Diaries](http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/) - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks
like Samus (and has ridiculous hot pants.)

[Breaking Rap](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/excerpts/~3/eq5Lmwvykds/in-case-you-skipped-final-fantasy-xiii-heres-a-breakdancing-recap-rap) - Amazing

[Slots are the worst](http://www.wethegamerz.com/2012/02/08/the-slots-of-serendipity-how-ffxiii-2-has-the-worst-minigame-ever/) - Yup

[Kat Bailey on Battle > Story](http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/15/do-japanese-rpgs-need-a-good-story/) - Yup
