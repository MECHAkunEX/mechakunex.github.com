I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark... which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would've only last one
hit... and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.

After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an "accurate" polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &
their speed.) That would be funny.

Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)

Total time: 19:30
