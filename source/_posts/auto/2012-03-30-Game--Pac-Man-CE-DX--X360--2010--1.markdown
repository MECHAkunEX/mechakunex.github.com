I've been playing this about every two days since I bought it. Two
days ago I got all the achievements---I reached the Championship I
maze and just did the next one to get the final achievement. Today
I did the Ghost Combo on Championship I... it is really hard!
I never noticed in the others that you need to beat a relatively
low local-high score (30) to even complete it, but it is very
difficult to get that many ghosts in this, because there aren't
sleeper ghosts. I'll have to study it more to do it.
