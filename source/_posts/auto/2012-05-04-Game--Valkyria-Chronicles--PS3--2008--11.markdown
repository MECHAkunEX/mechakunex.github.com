I played for about three hours today. I did a bunch of different
missions, all were done in a relatively "stealthy" style. It was
very hard though, but quite fun. The story is really interesting,
as I said. I was quite surprised by who shot Alicia. After the
next battle, I unlocked a few reports, which I am now going
through.

Total: 26:31
