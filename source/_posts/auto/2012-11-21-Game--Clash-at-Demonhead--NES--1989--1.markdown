I played again today and gave a bigger chance. I was able to
accomplish somethings, including killing one of the bosses. I
still think the core gameplay is really sloppy---the hit boxes
are bad, the shot control isn't great, and the interface is
pretty whack. But, I can see why some people might have loved it
when it was released. I'm done with it though.

Total time: 0:40
