I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.

I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She's a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That's important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said "Amazing chest ahead". It's so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.

After failing utterly fighting her *and* realizing I hadn't
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn't buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.

I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn't
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.

So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I'd get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.) 

After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.

I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.

With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds---first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit *real* hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.

So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I'll have to
perfect it later.
