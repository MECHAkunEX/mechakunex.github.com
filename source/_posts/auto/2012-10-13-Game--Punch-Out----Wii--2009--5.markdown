I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.

I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.

Total time: 4:18
