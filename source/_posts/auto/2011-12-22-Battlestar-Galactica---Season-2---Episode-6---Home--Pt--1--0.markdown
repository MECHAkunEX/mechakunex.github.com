The most important thing in this episode to me was that Adama
finally got his act together and decided to do what was
right. Other than that, the best thing was learning a little bit
more about the myths and scriptures of the humans. I hope that we
eventually learn more about the Kobol society and why people left
in the first place, etc. It's very fascinating---especially given
how much the Cylons seem to care about the human myths.
