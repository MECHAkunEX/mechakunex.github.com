Exploring 100 AF Bresha Ruins. This has been like one of two so
far missions where you have to travel to the
past/future. Actually, I've got to jump around quite a
bit. Something I'm not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I've been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM... the hover doesn't seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting... Mog is so funny in his
opinions about humans. :) I'm running the slot machines on auto
and got three ochu! But I then lost everything in Super Victory
Mode, so I didn't keep the save. [033:45:14 Frags 99/160 Lvl 369]
