I read the introduction today. I was very interested to learn that
the current ballet canon is very Russian, but made by a French guy,
and very late in the life of ballet. The concept of there being
very little data about the past of ballet is curious. I like the
idea that the story of this book will focus on the steps and forms
themselves. It seems like a style I would be most intrigued by.
