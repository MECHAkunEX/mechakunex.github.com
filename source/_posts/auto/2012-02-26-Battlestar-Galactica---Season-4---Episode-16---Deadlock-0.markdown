We didn't watch for as long as I hoped today... just one
episode. It was a really good episode though. I like the struggle
they are having about using support from the Cylons. I continue
to be fascinated by Gaius and what he is going to do. I love it
when he just says whatever Figment Six tells him to. I'm kind of
surprised what happened with Ellen. It seems even too low for
her. During this episode, I remembered something from the
Colonial Scriptures... it said that the 13th tribe was pursued by
demons. We were originally meant to assume that this was the
Cylons, but it appears that it was really not. I think it was
humans who later attacked them (as I said above.)
