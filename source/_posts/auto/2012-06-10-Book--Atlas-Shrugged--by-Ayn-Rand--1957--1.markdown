One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough "he said"/"she said" that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as "usability" problems with books.

For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I'm not
totally sure the speakers are correct:

Dagny: "I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be . . . like this. Growing colder and things stopping."

Hank: "I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute."

Dagny: "You did? Funny, I thought that, too."
