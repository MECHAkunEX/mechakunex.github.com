How could Hope still be alive after 300 years? Ah, time capsule;
interesting trick. Brain Blast is fun. I noticed a lot of
repurposed music today. I spent the majority of the night doing
side-quests in Academia. I wasted a lot of casino coins (almost
2k) on the slots in Serendipity. I got them all for free, so it
wasn't too depressing :) [020:36:49 Frags 37/160 Lvl 231]
