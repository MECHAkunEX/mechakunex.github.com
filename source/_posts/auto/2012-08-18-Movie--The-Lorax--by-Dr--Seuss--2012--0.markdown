I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn't see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.

The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he's a bad businessman because he doesn't have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O'Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.

I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There's this
text:

David Edelstein: "the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk" -- and
[in the movie] Ted says, "Wow, what does that even mean?" and
Audrey says, "I know, right?" So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss' sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth."

What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don't know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren't making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!
