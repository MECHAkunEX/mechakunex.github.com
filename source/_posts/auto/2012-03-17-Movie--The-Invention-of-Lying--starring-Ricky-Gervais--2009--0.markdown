The wife and I watched this tonight. It's a very funny premise: a
world where no one can lie and the first instance thereof. They do
a good job world-building and making the setting seem real. I love
how all the waiters and waitresses say horrible things to the
guests. The religious sub-plot is much cooler than the romantic
sub-plot, and I think they could have/should have followed that
further---with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it's just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.
