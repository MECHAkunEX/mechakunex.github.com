I bought this on the PS3 and played through up to the final
dungeon, but didn't want to grind to be able to get through it.

At the beginning of August, I played through FF7 for the first
time in a long time. It definitely is /not/ preserved as well as
Final Fantasy 6. The graphics are just ugly and
distracting. Additionally the game is filled with really annoying
minigames. Ugh. Nevertheless, the game is still pretty good.
