My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)

After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they've been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.

Pointed comments:

- (pg 5) "We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've
uncovered."

This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren't "conscientious" enough and even then
they say "almost any" and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don't make very
large claims.

- (pg 7) One of the "companies" we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a "Great"
company. I should throw the book out right now.

Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.

- (pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a "humble" leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.
