In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn't start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.

I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.

It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that's how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction "mysteries" are simply crazy
things you can't possible know until they come out of left
field. I'm glad this game wasn't like that.

I'm definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.
