I really liked this episode. It was cool to have the Cylons and
the humans interact directly again. It was really cool to learn
more about the religion/history of the humans. It was very
surprising that Gaius and Caprica Six are on the splits. I'm
fascinated to find out what Gaius and Three are up to. I'm very
intrigued by what will happen with Athena. I feel like we are now
starting the arc that will go all the way to the end of the
season.
