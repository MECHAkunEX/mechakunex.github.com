It is kind of crazy to go through the same areas like 4 times. The
fact that there is kind of a "hidden object" game inside this game
is strange when you reflect on it. I love my clock solver. The
dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine---would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn't;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius' life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I've been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They've firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn't win him as a monster? I tried Lightning & Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight's stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I'll be put into the
end game. [030:49:01 Frags 83/160 Lvl 337]
