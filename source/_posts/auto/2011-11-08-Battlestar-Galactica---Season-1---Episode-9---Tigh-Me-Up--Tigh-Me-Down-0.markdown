This was an interesting episode. It was very comical. There was a
funny "make-out spot" sequence with Billy. I thought the
developing plot with Sharon (on Caprica) is very interesting. I
really disliked the character of Tigh's wife... I hope that she
isn't that obnoxious all the time.

By the way, I really hate that they show spoilers for the episode
in the intro, so I close me eyes. So weird that they would do
that.
