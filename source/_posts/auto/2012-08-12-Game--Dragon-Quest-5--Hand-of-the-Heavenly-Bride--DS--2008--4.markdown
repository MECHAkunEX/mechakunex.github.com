I played for about two and half hours tonight. I've been taking a
break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.
