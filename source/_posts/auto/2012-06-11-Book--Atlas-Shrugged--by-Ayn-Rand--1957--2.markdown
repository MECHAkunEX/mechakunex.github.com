I'm now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven't got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I'm just
impervious to thinking they are too long?

Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love's interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I'm kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.
