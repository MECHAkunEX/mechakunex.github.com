Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.

This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and "flip" on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the "hardest"
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here's a video of someone else doing it:
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&feature=related).

Here are my end-game stats:

Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19

Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189

Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni

Here's another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.

I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it's easy to play.
