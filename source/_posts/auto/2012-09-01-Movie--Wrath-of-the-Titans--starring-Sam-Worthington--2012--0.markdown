This movie was fun, but definitely not as good as the first one. I
think the plot was much weaker and the cast was kind of thrown
together for no good reason---whereas the first one had a very
nice progression of how people joined the group. 

Rosamund Pike was very beautiful, but it was very weird that the
actress from the previous movie was replaced and because she acted
so differently than the character before I didn't realize it was
supposed to be the same person.

Overall, I don't feel like the sequel was really necessary, which
is unfortunate, because I thought the first one was so good.
