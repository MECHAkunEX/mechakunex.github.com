I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like "This Means War", in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don't think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely "hot" lady, although she's definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her "sexy" scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.
