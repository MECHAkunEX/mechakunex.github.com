Based on my last experience with the game, I think I'm basically
done with the game. I'm pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play---5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren't tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don't think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I'm doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn't quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can't remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn't noticed because I hadn't play SMB
yet.
