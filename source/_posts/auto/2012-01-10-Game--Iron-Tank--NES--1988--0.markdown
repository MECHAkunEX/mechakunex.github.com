I played some of Iron Tank the other day.

This was a super retro-goggle game. I didn't like it at all, but I
remember playing the first level sooo many times as a kid.

I found the controls to be really sloppy and the game to be too
slow. This is definitely a common complaint I have, but I want
games that are very exciting and fast. I don't have the patience
for ones that are too mind-numbing.
