Raincoat, starring Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai, is straight drama,
something that I have not seen to date in a Bollywood (technically
``Tollywood'', that is, Bengali) movie. I enjoyed the acting and
the story, but Amanda didn't think it was /that/ good.

A review on IMDB writes that it is an ``art-house movie
obviously not for commercial consumption.'' I can recommend it if
you don't expect a cutesy movie.
