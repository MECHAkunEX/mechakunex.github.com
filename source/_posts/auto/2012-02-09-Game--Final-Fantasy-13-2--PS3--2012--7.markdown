Chocobo gliding! That's how I got to the Graviton Beta! I just
noticed the Paradigm save system---I wanted something like that in
FF13.. I killed the Giant C'eith in Academia! It stinks he wasn't
guarding anything useful though. Searching through Academia for
the core is horrible. Woah!  Is Lightning a fal'Cie and she made
Snow a l'Cie? I like that every temporal rift is different. I
wrote a cute Racket program to solve the clock puzzle. I unlocked
all the roles. I really like reading the stuff that comes with
Fragments. It's like the datalog from the first game. [023:53:55
