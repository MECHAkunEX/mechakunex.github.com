I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
"hang" of it.

The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn't remember was that it really
isn't much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There's basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.

I can't say that this will go on the same "Play it again" list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.
