A while ago, I bought Raiden Fighters Aces for the 360 as part of
a bundle of games from the SHMUPS forum.

I played it a few times.

It is a compilation of three old shooters in the same
series. There's nothing really spectacular about them and they
aren't even visually fantastic. At least they aren't emulated
perfectly on MAME. I doubt I'll play it many times, but I will
keep it on my list in case I get shmup-desperate.
