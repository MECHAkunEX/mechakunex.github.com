I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.

This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I'm glad I
played it.

Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles
