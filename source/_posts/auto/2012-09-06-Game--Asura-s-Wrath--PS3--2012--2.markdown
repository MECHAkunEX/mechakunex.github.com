I played for two hours tonight and got to 11.5. There were so
many absurd moments. I loved how Asura flew by punching the
ground and riding the shock wave. I loved the onsen sequence and
how Asura was denied. I loved how Augus and Asura are
inexplicably on the moon and how ridiculously huge Augus' sword
is (and how he's never drawn it but once). I loved the gigantic
crater from the sword and how Asura always ends up with no
arms. It's also very intriguing that Augus was robot-y too. What
could that mean?

Total time: 4:15
