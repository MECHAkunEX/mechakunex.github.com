This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren't totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren't really
super heroes... more "super spys" and that didn't seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character... the actor played him too "cool" and above-it-all.

There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, "Ma'am, there's only one God, and I don't
think He dresses like that." Not only was it delivered really well,
but it's such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.

Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.
