A while ago I played Milon's Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game... which is
otherwise really opaque.

The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn't love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I'd have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don't totally love the mechanics and I can't save in between
play sessions, so I'd have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I'd seen enough.
