I was very curious about this game because I'm fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.

Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There's no continuous spray of bullets and doesn't even
seem to be a normal "fire" weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn't play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.

I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don't think it's for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I'm too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.
