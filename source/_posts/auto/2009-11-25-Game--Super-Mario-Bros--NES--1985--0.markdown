Over the past month I've been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn't remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she's been waiting a long time for me.

I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the
second quest.
