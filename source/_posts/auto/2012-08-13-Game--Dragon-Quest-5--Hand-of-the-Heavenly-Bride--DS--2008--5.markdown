I had to wait around for a long time today, so I played for about
40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn't use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn't use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I'll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.

Total time: 15:51
