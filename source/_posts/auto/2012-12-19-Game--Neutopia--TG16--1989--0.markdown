I played this game for about a half an hour today on an emulator.

It's a strange game. It seems like it is trying to be Legend of
Zelda I, but it has tried to evolve, it seems. For instance, I
felt like inside every cave was a person just blathering on about
stuff that didn't matter. The combat feels a bit... off. It's
like it is very hard to line enemies up. In LTTP, since the sword
slices in an arc, it never really matters if you aren't lined up
perfectly. In LoZ, you do need to be straight, but I think the
enemies are guaranteed to be in a grid, so it is easy to hit
them. It's a strange thing to miss. It seems like the dungeons
are much more linear and I got to the end of one, but couldn't
beat the boss (after a ton of tries)... it seems to have way too
much health.

I will give it another session... but I'm not impressed.

Total time: 0:27
