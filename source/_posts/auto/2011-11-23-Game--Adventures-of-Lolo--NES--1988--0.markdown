Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don't
remember ever beating the game.

I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn't work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.

I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can't think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.
