Chameli is a much shorter Bollywood movie than is typical. It is
has a different style -- a couple that doesn't quite connect and is
made of a prostitute and businessman, but nothing like the cuteness
of /Pretty Woman/. The story is surprising, but Amanda didn't like
it very much, although I enjoyed it.

It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose.

A note on the songs -- the one Kareena dances is good, but most of
the others are not so good. But, the dancing in the club is great,
although a bit too provocative for my tastes.
