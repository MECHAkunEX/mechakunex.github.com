I advanced the story quite a bit. I feel like I'm in the closing
stages: I'm going to fight Zangurak, then send the Outsider back,
and live happily ever after with Calista. I thought her wedding
dress was very cute and I liked the resolution of the wedding
plot. In the game play, there's been a bit of a boss rush of sorts
where boss encounters similar to ones from earlier in the game
keep coming back. It's fun though. The fight next to the Outside
was pretty exciting and difficult. That whole sequence going down
the tunnel was very difficult---I think I died three times.

I accidentally used the Auto-Equip feature and all my outfits
changed. It was very painful to go back to dressing all the girls
how I like.
