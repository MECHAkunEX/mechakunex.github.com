This was a really intriguing episode. It's crazy that there is
meta-reflection in the Cylon world, where they are treating the
Raiders & Centurions like the Humans used to treat the
Cylons. I think the Sixes are clearly in the right, and I'm a bit
amazed that the others don't see their hypocrisy. I was kind of
amazed that Gaius saw himself and they didn't make any further
mention of that being strange.
