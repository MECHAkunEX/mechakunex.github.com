Like Alien Crush, this game is a very exciting and interesting
pinball table. I feel like this game is a lot crazier because
after the initial ideas in Alien Crush, they were able to go all
out. There's lots moving around on the course, there's three
layers, and many complicated dependencies between
pieces. In that sense, it's much better. Plus, they added a
pass-the-controller 2-player option, which is pretty neat.

Unfortunately, the ball physics feel much worse and the ball seems
totally outside of your control. I think part of it is that the
board is broken into three screens and each one is squatter (and
thus more detailed) than any screen was in Alien Crush. At the end
of the day, the game feels worse, despite looking much cooler.

Nevertheless, I could imagine playing this game a lot... if not
for the interface friction.

When I played, my dad and I did the pass-the-controller for a
bit. My best score was 3.7 mil. I got this by getting the castle
on the bottom and then just being super cautious whenever I was
on the bottom screen. It worked like a charm!

Total time: 0:33
