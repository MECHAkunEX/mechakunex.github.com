This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn't continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them "famous" or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.
