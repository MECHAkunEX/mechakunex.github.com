This movie is insane. It is like a live action anime movie. It is
like Bayonetta mixed with Kill Bill. It is like Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon, but turned up to 29. It is crazy. The visuals are
out of control, the style is amazing, the story is
fascinating. Wow. It's like Dynasty Warriors: The Movie: The Game:
The Movie. I love the scenes when Goemon is protecting Chacha when
they are young---super epic.
