I played for about two hours tonight. I fought the Hydra and
boosted some levels, plus I found a new armor setup. I went to
fight the double bosses in Londo, but died both times I tried. The
second time, I got Ornstein down to one more hit before death. :(
I think I will try to upgrade my weapon to fire element... which
will be a bit of a trek.

TODO list:
- Go to Demon Ruins
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley
