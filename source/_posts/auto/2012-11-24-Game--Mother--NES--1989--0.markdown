I played this game (via the prototype ROM dump) for a bit
today. It's clear that this was the precursor to Earthbound. The
dialogue is great and the enemies are very odd.

It is also clear that it is a straight Dragon Quest clone. I was
not able to make it from the front door of my house to town
without dying. It took three trips before I reached a high enough
level to make it. When I got there, I had about $250 in cash, but
the next worthwhile weapon was $500. Classic. I started walking
around and was decimated by the first zombie on the way to the
cemetery (plot point #1).

During my short play, I noticed a few typos. This, combined with
the anticipatory pain of grinding, has led me to decide to replay
it on the Mother 1+2 remake for the GBA with the fan translation
that adds the "Easy Ring" option. I was definitely convinced that
I want to play this game, but not convinced by the NES version.

Total time: 0:37
