I played through most of Super God Trooper Zeroigar, a shmup for
the PC-FX, tonight. It was pretty rad, but got a little bland
towards the end, which is why I stopped playing. I don't
understand Japanese, so the long Anime cutscenes and conversations
didn't have a big impact on me, but I appreciated their
presence. The shmuping was good, but the controls are way too
sensitive, which led to many stupid deaths.
