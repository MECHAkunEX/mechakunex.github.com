I played for like three hours tonight. There's been lots of crazy
reveals in the game, some that have been obvious for a long time
and others that were just cool. Getting on to Mechonis was
awesome. It was crazy to see the new map screen. Rad.

Some of the main-line fetch quests in this game are absurd. You
walk through an area and then get to the end are given a fetch
quest where you walk all the way back across the area. It's
totally insane.

Total time: 18:08
