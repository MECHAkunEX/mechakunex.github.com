I played for about an hour today. I gained a level in the Painted
World and then worked my way back so I could explore the Darkroot
Garden. I killed the Butterfly and unlocked the magic door, but
then stopped for the night.

TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley
