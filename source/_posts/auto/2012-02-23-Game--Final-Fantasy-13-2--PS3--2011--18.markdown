My first time really playing in almost a week! The Chaos Crystal
weapons aren't really powerful yet, I guess I don't have enough
Fragments. I made my list of things to do in each location more
clear. The only location/time with a gate I haven't gone to is the
Archelytte Steppe. I just got a Gigantaur crystal!!!  I love that
the hover jump is enough to get over a bridge-distance in the
steppe. Hey! I found Sazh! Sazh's little speech sounds like he was
reading it and did it so fast. After that I saw Lightning, but it
was strange because she acted like she couldn't hear us, but at
other points in the story see can see everything
everywhere. [045:33:27 Frags 120/160 Lvl 443]
