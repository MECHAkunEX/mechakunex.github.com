This was a really interesting "political intrigue" style
episode. I think my favourite thing is how Gaius is always
presented as the bad guy, but he's so right most of the time. It
is really fascinating. I always wonder what some kinds of people
do all day... like the people who were actors or retailers or
other jobs that can't really exist anymore. I like the Chief's
point that they should be doing odd jobs.
