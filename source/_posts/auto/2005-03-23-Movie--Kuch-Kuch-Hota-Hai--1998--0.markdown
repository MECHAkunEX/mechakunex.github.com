Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, from the team that created Kabhi Kushi Kabhie
Gham..., is an exceedingly cute movie. Starring is Shahrukh Khan,
Kajol, and Rani Mukherjee.

I thought the story, acting, and songs were great. Actually, the
songs were fabulous. I have a collection of CDs with songs from
Shahrukh movies, and I loved all the songs from this movie before I
saw it.

Shahrukh is handsome and well dressed in the movie, although he
reminds me a frog in general. Kajol was beautiful in the second
half and her wedding gowns were amazing. Rani was beautiful in the
beginning, although I think she looks better without her "modern
ideas."
