This was a touching episode. The pilots are so brave and selfless
for getting everyone through at such personal cost. It was
interesting to learn that there is more to Kat. I am glad that
they didn't draw it out and really destroy her character. I'm
also a little surprised that they would kill her off just half
way through the season. The goings-on with Gaius are awesome as
usual.
