I play this a bit pretty much every time I got to the
bathroom. I'm stuck at a pretty standard score---I can get to the
first few red enemies. I still feel like the game's control would
be so much better with real buttons, etc. I've noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. [This interesting review](http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/) has some
observations I had too.
