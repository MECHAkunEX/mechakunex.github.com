I thought the resolution of the trial was awesome, though I wish
that Gaius was able to defend himself a little bit more so people
wouldn't hate him so much. The end of the season was CRAZY! 4
Cylons! Starbuck! Hera! Gaius! It was great. I can't wait to see
what else happens... particularly what the Cylons will do.
