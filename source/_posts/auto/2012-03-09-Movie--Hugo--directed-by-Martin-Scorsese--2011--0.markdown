This was a neat movie. It reminds me a lot of Amelie---both in its
Frenchness and that there are slightly fantastical things going on
in an otherwise mundane plot. There was some pretty bad CG
work---the people on the platform in the opening sequence. The
characters were very funny and memorable. It was neat to learn
about Meilies---I read his Wikipedia page afterward. Nevertheless,
it seemed pretty shameless in its appeal to the Academy for awards:
it's a movie about how awesome movies are.
