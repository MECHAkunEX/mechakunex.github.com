I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It's not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.

I'm finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven't
died since I restarted.

I made it through a bunch more areas (I'm about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don't know.) It's almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don't see
the global path so you don't get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.

When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn't find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
"side" quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places... kind
of a hole... that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.

Total time: 6:10
