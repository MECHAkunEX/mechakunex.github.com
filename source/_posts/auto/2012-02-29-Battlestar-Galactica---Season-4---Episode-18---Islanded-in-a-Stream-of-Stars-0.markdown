This was a very interesting episode. I can't believe how terrible
Boomer is. Athena seems like she's in so much pain. I love the
little insight into Gaius' operation. There's now only one show
left, I have no idea how they can close it up. *REDACTED* thinks they
have to back and live on New Caprica, because that's the only
habitable place they know. Could Hera do something that will
drastically improve the situation from the Cylon Colony? What
will it be like when the Cylon Basestar is the military HQ? It's
intense.
