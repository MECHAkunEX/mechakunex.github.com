My wife and I saw this tonight [which is why I wanted to write down
my thoughts about the other ones.] I found a lot about this movie a
lot better than QoS. I thought the movie was paced a lot better and
the new characters were quite interesting. On the other hand, there
wasn't really an deep connections. Even the deepest connection
(between M and 007) wasn't developed much. In addition, the goal of
the villain wasn't at a very big scale. He was almost Bane or
Joker-ish in his abilities, but had a trivial revenge scheme
planned. There were lots of holes and missed opportunities---why
not just blow up MI6 when M was there if he wanted to kill her so
bad? Why was Severine with the guy getting killed? Why would
Patrice be necessarily working for the same guy twice? Severine's
death was totally ignored and Bond doesn't even acknowledge it
happens. The island is a wasted set. The best parts are the
committee hearing and the showdown at Skyfall.
