I recently played the DS remake of this and it was amazing, but I
can't play this older version. I have some memories of it because
my good friend from elementary school had it and I borrowed it. I
think I only made it to Taloon's part when I played it then. In
situations like this, I'm worried that someone will come to my
site's rankings and think I dislike this game, but I do
like... just not this release. Perhaps I should change my
tracking program to keep track of releases and games distinctly
so I can rank the games, not just the releases?
