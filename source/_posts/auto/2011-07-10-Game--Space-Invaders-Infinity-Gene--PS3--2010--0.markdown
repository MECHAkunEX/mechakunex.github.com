I've been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.

It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons---although there are some clear winners overall.

My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can't. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.

I'd recommend it, but I probably won't schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.
