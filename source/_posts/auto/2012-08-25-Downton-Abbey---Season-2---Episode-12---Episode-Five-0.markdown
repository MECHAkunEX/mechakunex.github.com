Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.
