I played for about an hour today. I'm trying to beat the Pro VS
match. I tried first and the match lasted 15 minutes and I
ultimately lost after a good run of wins. I decided to try "Easy
Mode" to see how easy it was... and I lost twice and then won,
but failed on 3-5 twice. Easy doesn't really seem that much
easier and it's not worth having the green medal on the score
icon. I feel like I'm at a bit of a wall in this game and should
play it a lot less.

I'm going to schedule it for a weekly session on Sunday morning.

Total time: 9:51
