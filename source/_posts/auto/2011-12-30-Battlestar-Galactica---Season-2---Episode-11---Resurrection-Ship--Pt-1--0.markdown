This was a really tense episode, although I'm surprised they
resolved the main thing from the last day so quickly. I can't
believe how horrible the Pegasus admiral and crew
is... especially in their treatment of the Cylons and the
civilian ships with them. Man. That's horrible. The cliff-hanger
on this episode was pretty rough too, but 綾女 was the voice of
reason and had us stop for the night.
