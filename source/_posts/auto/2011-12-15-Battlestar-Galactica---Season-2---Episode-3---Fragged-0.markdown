I think my two favourite parts about this episode were the events
involving the Chief and the President.

I thought the Chief acted very wisely in trying to help out the
two girls, but also that he was noble in his obedience to
"soldier ethics" in regards to the Doctor's disagreement with the
Lt. I find the command structure of the military to be
fascinating---I don't want to be involved in it, but it's
great.

The President's little speech and revelation was pretty epic and
tough.

The XO is such a punk. I wonder how Adama will clean up his mess
once he wakes up. Tension.
