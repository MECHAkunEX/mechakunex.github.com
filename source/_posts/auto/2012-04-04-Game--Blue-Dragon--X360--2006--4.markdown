I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene's character---and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery---is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.

I got all the skills for a few classes, so I've made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they've dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.
