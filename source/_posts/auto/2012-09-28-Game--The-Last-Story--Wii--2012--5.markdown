I played for a short amount of time yesterday before going to
bed. I mainly just advanced the story. It turns out that Lavos is
behind Zael's power and the destruction of the world. Bummer. I'm
excited about a cute wedding scene.

TODO Go back to the mysterious island and go behind the entrance
where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.

Zael Level: 42
Total time: 20:57
