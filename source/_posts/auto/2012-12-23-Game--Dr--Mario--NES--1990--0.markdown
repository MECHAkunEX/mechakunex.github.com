I played this for about 45 minutes. I'd never really played it
before and I just assumed it was exactly the same as Tetris. But
it's much more complex and incredibly challenging.

I got to Level 8 with a score of 30,600.

During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense
pressure. The game board is so claustrophobic and you feel like
no decision is the right one. It's so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.

My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She's amazing!

Total time: 0:45
