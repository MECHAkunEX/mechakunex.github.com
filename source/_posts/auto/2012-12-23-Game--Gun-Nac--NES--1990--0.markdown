I played this and got to Area 5 on one continue. (There are 8
levels.) My score was 1,997,270 points. This is one of those old
shmups (I think of them as of the "Solider" archetype) where if
you die then you are totally screwed because you lose all your
power-ups. In this round, but Area 3, I had literally everything
you could get (there's a store to buy stuff and it tells you when
there isn't anything to get), and was stomping on everything. But
then I lost it at the end of Area 4, then spammed bombs on the
boss and then spent a few continues trying and failing to get
past Area 5.

There were a lot of cute graphics... really weird stuff but not
"cute" like Parodius, more just bizarre. That was fun to look at,
but the mechanics weren't worth trying again.

Total time: 0:36
