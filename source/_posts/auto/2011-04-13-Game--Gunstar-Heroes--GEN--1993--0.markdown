I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I'm a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I'd never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It's really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn't have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.

[This review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335) of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn't do better. Check that out.

When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, "This looks
cool." That's a good sign.
