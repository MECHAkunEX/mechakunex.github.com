This was a truly amazing episode. I love learning more about the
Cylons and particularly about what Caprica Six (what I called her
too) and Galactica Sharon are up to. Although, I was expecting
them to run off with the human, now I realize it will be cooler
for them to work inside. I'm surprised that Gaius doesn't know
about what happened to the baby... I hope he will find out as
well as the actual mother. I think it is cool because they are
kind of setting it up so that Gaius and the Cylons on Caprica are
kind of the moral center of the show, since they effectively want
peace. When Gaius showed up to Number Six, *REDACTED* and I were like
"Whaaaaat?" as if he was a Cylon, but I think that him being in
her brain is actually more crazy. I guess we're to think it is
God?
