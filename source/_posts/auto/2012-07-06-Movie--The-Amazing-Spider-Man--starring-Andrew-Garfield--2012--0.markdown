I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.

I'm not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.

I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren't
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She's got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.

I quite like the development of Pete's understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.

I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter's
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.

I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.
