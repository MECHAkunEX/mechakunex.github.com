We watched the first episode of Battlestar Galactica last
night. Actually the first part of the miniseries.

My favourite part was how clearly they communicated that most
people had no idea what the Cylons were like and have no fear of
them, but that the old guys who do are the best qualified to deal
with them. I really liked the realization, as the war started,
that almost all the soldiers were too young to have even ever
seen a Cylon, but were now responsible to deal with them.

Very cool so far, I'm excited about the show.
