I read the speech by Francisco at James' wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It's like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.

I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don't know that much more than the characters but it's so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn't occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.
