This was a pretty cheesy comic book movie. The story was quite
different than others, with its god-like characters and its vast
universe.

On one hand, I liked that it didn't really dwell on the fact that
aliens exist, etc. But on the hand, that was the most interesting
part of the movie, but it was also totally unfulfilled.

The characters all play totally to type and lots of character
development consists of almost a single scene to establish the type
and then the movie moves on. (Most of the scenes with Blake
Lively.)

My other favourite scene was the opening dog fight with the
experimental planes. It was interesting how it foreshadowed the
ending. It was unfortunate that an otherwise heroic moment was
shattered by a cliche character reveal.

And one more... when Blake saw through the disguise. Brilliant.

But despite a few high moments, it's a pretty vapid movie.
