This was an amazing episode. It combined a lot of things that I
really like: intrigue, Gaius, heroism, and tense action. It was
masterful the way that Gaius convinced the president to do
something and then used it against her later. Very
brilliant. Now, of course, I agree with the thing they are
presenting as bad in the show, but nevertheless, I can appreciate
it as poor politics.
