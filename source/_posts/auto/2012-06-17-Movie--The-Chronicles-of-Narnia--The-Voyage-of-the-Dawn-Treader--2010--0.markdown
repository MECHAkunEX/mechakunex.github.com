This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film. 

I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they're
fighting fear itself, but there's no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.

The movie's version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.
