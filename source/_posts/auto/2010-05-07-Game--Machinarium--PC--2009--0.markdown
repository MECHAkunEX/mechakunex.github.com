Over the past week or so, I've played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms---I played on the Mac.

It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven't played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end---it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.

I got the game [for free](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html), so it was totally worth it. It costs [$20](http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287)
and I'd say it is worth closer to $15.
