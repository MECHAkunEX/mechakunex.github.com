This episode was interesting, but it was the first "normal"
episode for me, rather than one that really blew me away. I
thought it was neat to imagine how Sharon didn't even realize she
was a Cylon and could actually fight against it. It was also cool
to learn more about the logistics of the Fleet. I like that
seemingly trivial things like that can be the "enemy" in this
show. I'm also very curious where the stuff on Caprica will
go. It doesn't seem like it can possibly be relevant because Karl
can't ever get to where the Galactica is.
