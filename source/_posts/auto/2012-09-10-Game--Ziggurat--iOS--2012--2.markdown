I've had this game on my "Queue" since I bought it, but I've had
to admit to myself that I just hate playing games on the iPhone
so much, I'm definitely not going to sit down and play
this. Sometimes I play it when I'm waiting for something, but I
have other things that feel more productive that I could be doing
on my phone.

I like the game and I think it is the best iPhone game I've
played, but I really dislike the iPhone interface and this game
in particular feels like it would work just as well with
buttons. I feel like the only way for me to appreciate this game
will be for me to re-implement it myself and give it buttons.

So, I'm retiring it from my queue, with a bit of a sad face.
