This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It's funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There's lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.
