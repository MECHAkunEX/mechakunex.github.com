Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I'd played
it a few times about my brother-in-law's house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren't adjustable and the defaults don't work
as well on the stick. Bummer.

I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay... like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.

Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.

Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def
