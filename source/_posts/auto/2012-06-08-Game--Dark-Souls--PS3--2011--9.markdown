I played for about three hours and got to the first boss of Anor
Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can't really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.

TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley
