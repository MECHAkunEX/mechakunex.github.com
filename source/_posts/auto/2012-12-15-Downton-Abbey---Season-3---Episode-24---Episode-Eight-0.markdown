I'm glad Thomas is okay by the end. I thought the sub-plot of
Rose was really great. I like it because it really sets up a big
contrast between Rose (who is wild) and Edith (who is not) but
both are pursued by married men. In addition, Rose is a bit of a
stand-in for Mary at the beginning of the show, when she did
things that Edith would not approve of. Mary's comment on the
sixth episode was very striking, that she doubts that Edith and
she would get along any better. She's very realist.

It's nice that three men in the show are getting on. It will be
interesting to plot that part of the history of Downton.
