We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he'll play himself some day and I'll watch.

Total time: 2:57
