Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror's
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.

The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can't believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I'm glad I'd at least run into her
before.

Total time: 12:20
