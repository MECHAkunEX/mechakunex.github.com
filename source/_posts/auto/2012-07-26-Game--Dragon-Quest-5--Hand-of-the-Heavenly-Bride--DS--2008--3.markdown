We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I've
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game... they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she'd be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said "until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die" instead of
"until death do you part"... thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.
