We just noticed that the next season was released in the
UK. This was a fun episode to get back with everyone again. I'm
glad that they've evolved the challenge to be more than just
Mary and Matthew fighting. It seems like the new challenge will
be this money problem and it will last through the whole
season. Obviously I have no clue, but they've actually got a
reliable problem to lean on.
