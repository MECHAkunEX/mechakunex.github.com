I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.
