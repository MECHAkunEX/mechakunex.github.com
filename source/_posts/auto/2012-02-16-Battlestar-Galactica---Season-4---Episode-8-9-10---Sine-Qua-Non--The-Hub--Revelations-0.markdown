This was another really intense sequence of episodes. I thought
Lee becoming president was incredibly predictable. I can't
believe Sol was shacking up with Caprica Six... I can't believe
she was shacking with him; I hope she was using him for some
reason. The episode from the Cylon perspective was cool. I loved
Gaius talking to the Centurian. I still think it was horribly
wrong to destroy the resurrection hub. The revelation of who the
Four were, etc was really cool; especially how quickly Tory was
able to get over to the ship without people realizing. Getting to
Earth was super epic... having it be destroyed was also super
epic. As we were seeing Earth, *REDACTED* was like "What could they do
now?" Well, now we know.

I expect that the humanoid Cylons are really the 13th tribe, or
at least the creators/creations of them or something like that.
