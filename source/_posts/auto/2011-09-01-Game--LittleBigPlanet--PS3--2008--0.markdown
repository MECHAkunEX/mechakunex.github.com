I played LittleBigPlanet last night too, which I got as part of
the same promotion as inFAMOUS. I had played the demo before.

This game is amazingly adorable. The team introduction in the
first level is adorable too.

This could have been a really charming and enjoyable game,
but....

Wow, bad controls. So bad, I'm not actually interested in playing
it anymore. Really disappointing.

Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?
