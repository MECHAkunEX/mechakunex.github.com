This morning I played for about an hour. I was surprised at how
quickly the new Jirall plot line was resolved. I was also very
sad that Calista was kidnapped. The game does a really good job
of making you feel really connected to and protective of
her. During the Jirall fight, I realized that I hadn't seen
Dagran in a long time... where is he?

After we got home from the day, I played again, all night (about
four hours, with some breaks for snacks, etc.) I basically beat
the game and got to the epilogue. The final sequences had some
really tough fights. I fought the final boss three times before
winning. The final reveal of the big bad was pretty intense. I
really liked the epilogue sequence with Calista's parents. It
seemed so appropriate for the couple to go on a little adventure
together before getting married. It's adorable. Calista's dress
was great too. I wish you could have her wear it during normal
gameplay. I feel like there's still a lot of stuff to do in the
game... people to talk to, weapons to continue upgrading,
etc. It's very strange. It's like the final sequence of Earthbound
or Dragon Warrior but amped to the max because there's so much to
do. It's exciting.
