We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I'm surprised
that in this episode they didn't show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.

The "rally girl" thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn't playing.
