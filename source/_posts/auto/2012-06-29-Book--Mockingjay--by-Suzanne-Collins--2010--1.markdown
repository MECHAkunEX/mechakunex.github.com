Katniss destroying the Holo was pretty stupid.

Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.

Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.

Snow's conversation with Katniss: very believable.

Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?

Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.
