I recently played through Excitebike on the NES. I considered it
completed when I placed in the top three in each race.

I remember playing this a lot as a kid, although when I was young
I would mostly make tracks with tons and tons of jumps, rather
than actually playing the races. In fact, when I started to play
recently I didn't even know about the two different acceleration
buttons, although I quickly figured it out and did okay.

It's a pretty fun game, but I like modern racing games better. In
a lot of cases (i.e. sports games) I like the older, more abstract
games better, but in this case I think that it is a bit too
simplistic for my current tastes.
