This was a great episode. My favourite characters are Gaius and
Number Six, so I was glad that the whole episode was about
them---with a little bit in the background maintaing the other
plot threads. I'm excited for him to actually make progress on
the Cylon detector (slash) doing the will of Number Six. I'm also
really excited about studying the Raider.
