When we got this from Netflix, my wife said "Ugh, Evangelion?" But
I think she enjoyed it. She commented on how the music was really
good and we were both impressed by the obviously better graphics
and effects. It is amazing how much is the same between this and
the originals though. I think it is already clearer what the
greater story is. I think there are more risque shots than before,
but, even so, they are quite tame. Not much to say other than that
I like Evangelion and this was preferred to watching the original
episodes. (Although I do miss the theme song.)
