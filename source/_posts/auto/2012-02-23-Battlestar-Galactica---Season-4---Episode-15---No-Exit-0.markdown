This episode had a major plot dump. It was very interesting and
pretty consistent. I think my favourite part was how Helen
described how John set the Five up so that they would have "front
row seats" to his plans. It was also interesting to speculate on
the meaning of "this has all happened before"---particularly
given the implication that the 13th Tribe were Cylons and there
was a war on Kobol between AIs and Humans. They still haven't
explained who destroyed Earth when the Cylons were living
there. I speculate that it was a group of humans from Kobol who
had been searching for the Cylons for revenge and didn't go with
the 12 Colonies. I'm also fascinated by the idea that Galactica
is falling apart and will be improved by Cylons technology. And
I'm fascinated that Lee will reform the government. I can't
believe that the show can keep getting better and going in
different directions.
