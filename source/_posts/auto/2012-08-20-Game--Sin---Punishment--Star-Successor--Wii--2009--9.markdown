I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn't move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don't think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.
