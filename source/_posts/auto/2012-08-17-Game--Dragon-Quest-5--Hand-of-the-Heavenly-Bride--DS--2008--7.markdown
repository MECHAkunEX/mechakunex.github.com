I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn't have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they're just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.

Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.

[A great review](http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak).
