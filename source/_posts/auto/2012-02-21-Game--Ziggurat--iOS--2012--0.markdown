I really like Tim Rogers and read a few reviews of this, so I got
it the week it came out. I played for about 5 minutes. So far it
is okay, but I feel like it be so much better with real buttons
and a D-pad. It is a very non-intuitive control scheme and clearly
contrived into what the iPhone can do. Ugh. I hate iPhone
games. I'll try it again, but at a first glance I appear to have
been duped again.
