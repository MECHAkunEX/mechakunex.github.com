I feel like I know a little more the purpose of the plot on
Caprica. I greatly enjoyed the many references to the scriptures
of the humans. I thought the large insight on Baltar's part about
his role and position was interesting. Overall, it was a cool
episode. It had exploration of the universe, some good drama,
some good action, etc.
