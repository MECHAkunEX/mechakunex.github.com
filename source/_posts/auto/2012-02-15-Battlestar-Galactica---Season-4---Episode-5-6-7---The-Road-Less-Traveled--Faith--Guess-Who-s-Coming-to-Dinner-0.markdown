This sequence of three episodes was really intense. The mutiny
aboard the Demetrius, Gaius' monotheism, the alliance with the
Cylons, it is all incredibly fascinating. Each episode is ending
of a severe cliff-hanger, particularly the third one in this
sequence, because they jump away. Crazy.

I can't believe Athena killed the Rebel Leader.

Although I was impressed by the Rebel Leader's speech to the
Quorum, I think it is wrong for the humans to take away their
resurrection ability. It is just as bad as what the Cylons did to
the humans. They need to be bigger and try to promote peace.
