I played inFAMOUS last night. I'm glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the "So, sorry, Sony" program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.

At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.

The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.

I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.

Ba-leted!
