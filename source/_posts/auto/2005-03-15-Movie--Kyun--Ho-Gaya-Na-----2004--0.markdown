Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... is an incredibly adorable romantic comedy. It
stars Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, with a supporting role for
Amitabh Bachchan. The songs were cute, but I was a bit let down by
the absence of traditional-style dances and costumes. The story was
great and I was on the edge of my seat, about to write the most
depressing LiveJournal entry ever, had the last plot twist not
happened.
