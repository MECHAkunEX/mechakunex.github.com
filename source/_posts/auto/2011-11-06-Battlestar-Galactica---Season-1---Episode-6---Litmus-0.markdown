This was a very court-room drama style episode. I was most
interested in speculating about Gaius and what's going on
Caprica. The stuff on Galactica was fine, but not the kind of
thing I'm really into. I feel like the disobedience of tribunal
will be forgotten, but if it won't be, then this will be a
pivotal moment.
