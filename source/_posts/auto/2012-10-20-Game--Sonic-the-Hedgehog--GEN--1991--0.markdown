I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.

Total time: 0:22
