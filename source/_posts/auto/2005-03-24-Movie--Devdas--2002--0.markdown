Devdas stars Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, and Aishwarya Rai.

I can't say much about the story, besides that it
/sounds/ very interesting from the DVD box blurb, but the
DVD I got did not have subtitles (and did not seem to be a bootleg
either.) However, the blurb was very detailed, so I was able to get
most of what was going on in the movie.

I really enjoyed the dancing and music, particular the song /Dola
Re Dola/ (chapter 17 on the DVD.) I cannot stress how amazing it
is. It motivated me to go read about the different styles of Indian
dance, whereupon I found [this article](http://www.meissoun.ch/dlai/dlai-bw-artikel-e.htm) that talks about the
different kinds in movies. It actually mentions that the dancing in
/Devdas/ is the Kathak style.

Recommendation: If you know Hindi, it's probably fabulous. If
you can find a DVD with subtitles, it's probably great. If not,
check out the songs. (And if I know you, I can show you the one
song I /really/ like.)

(More on the DVD: The DVD from Eros Entertainment is supposed to
be a special edition double-disc and is probably much better than
what I found, from the original producer.)
