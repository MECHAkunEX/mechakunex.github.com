I played for about two hours today. The scenery was really
cool. It was awesome going through the swamp and the Bionis'
body. The visions that Schulk it seeing now are very cool and I
can't wait to get to that area of the game. Dunban's new outfit
is neat too. I still think the battle system is terrible, and I
still think the world is exciting.

Total time: 11:13
