The first Mega Man game I think I owned and played a lot was Mega
Man 2. But I remember trying to play Mega Man 1 quite a few times,
I don't know if I bought it or if I rented it from
Blockbuster. Regardless, I wasn't very good at it and can't really
ever remember getting to Wily's Castle at all. I think the biggest
problem was the lack of continues or passwords.

Today that 20 year battle was finished and I played through all of
Mega Man.

I'm amazed at how good this game is. I had always kind of thought
that the sequel was drastically better. It definitely has lots of
improvements, but this game is definitely amazing too.

I used an Infinite Lives Game Genie code so I didn't have to
Continue, etc. The spacing of checkpoints is pretty wide in this
game though, so it was nowhere near a walk in the park.

I'm very proud of myself for defeating some of the really
difficult segments. For example, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NDK1tIaNwU&amp;feature=related][beginning of Guts Man's
stage]]; the [disappearing blocks section of Ice Man's stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ8cTlCMiE4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s); and
[Yellow Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahAKcUX5PW0).

This game makes you feel like a super hero. It's awesome.
