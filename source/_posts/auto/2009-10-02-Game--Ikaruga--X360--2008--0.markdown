I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can't believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.

The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I'm really impressed by
this game and can't wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.

There are some amazing videos of it online: [level 3 (perfect)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y) and
[1 player 2 player](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk). And [here's a description of the story](http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml).
