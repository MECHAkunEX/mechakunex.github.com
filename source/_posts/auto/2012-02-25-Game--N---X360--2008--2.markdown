I just had the worst experience playing this game ever. It lost my
progress from last time so I had to do a five level sequence over
again. It was unbearable. I noticed that this game has a much
worse UI than Meat Boy. For example, it is infuriating to have to
save every five levels and that it didn't work and that you need
to press A to revive and that you can't watch replays. Annoying!
