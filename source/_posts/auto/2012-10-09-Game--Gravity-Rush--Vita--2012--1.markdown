I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn't do
any of the combat ones. I'm really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I'm moving it away from myself. It's
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the "stealth" mission was really un-intuitive.

Total time: 3:21
