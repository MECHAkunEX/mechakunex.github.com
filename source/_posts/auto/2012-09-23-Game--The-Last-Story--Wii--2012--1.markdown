I played again for about four hours. I got to the island and did
the two side quests there and then went to the Gurak base. I'm
really enjoying the flow of the story and the development of
Zael's & Callista's relationship. I changed the combat controls
to Manual and I find it quite a bit more fun, even though I liked
it before. It is understandable, but I don't like that I can't go
to the arena right now... I am really strapped for cash and I
have a lot of upgrades I'd like to do. I think the narrator is a
really fun, cute little touch.

Zael Level: 20
Total time: 8:10
