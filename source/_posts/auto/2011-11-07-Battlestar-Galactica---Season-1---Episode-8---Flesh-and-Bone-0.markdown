I'm beginning to really like Starbuck's personality and I like
the interrogation of the Cylon, because they are very interesting
characters. This was the first time I realized that it is a bit
unreasonable to only show Cylons we know of working together
(when they are by themselves) simply as a conceit to the fact
that viewers shouldn't know who the other ones are. The trope of
a "shadowy council" probably won't be as bad as this. I think it
is very interesting to speculate on the psyche and goals of the
Cylons, particularly with their psychological warfare like shown
in this episode. I was very intrigued by what would happen when
Gaius found out that Sharon was a Cylon... will he tell Adama
right away?
