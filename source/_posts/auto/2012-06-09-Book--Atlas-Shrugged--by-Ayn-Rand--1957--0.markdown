Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It's a fascinating book. I don't find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be... it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.

It's hard to not compare the book's story to the story of the
movie. I don't know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.

For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It's not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.

In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.

I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are "the
People's state of such-and-such".

In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.
