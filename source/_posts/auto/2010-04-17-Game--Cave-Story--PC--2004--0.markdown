Over the past few days, I've played through Cave Story on the
PC. (It has recently been re-released in an updated form for
WiiWare.)

It has a very unique and fun mix of Mega Man, Metroid, and
Adventure-style game play. I played through the "Hard" version of
the game where you get Booster 2.0 and I played through the "Hell"
final area as well.

I highly recommend it. It is free to download and it's very
fun. It inspires me to work more often on my game ideas.
