This was a really fascinating episode. I love learning about the
Cylons. The idea of projection, the taboo about the other five
Cylons, the idea of the hybrids, it is all very fascinating. It
is also incredible to imagine how the 13th tribe could have left
a booby trap for the Cylons. I hope that they go into that,
rather than just leaving it to be forgotten. I can't tell why
Gaius didn't share this information... he doesn't seem to be
using it against them in any way. The drama on Galactica was
neat, but drastically overshadowed by this other stuff.
