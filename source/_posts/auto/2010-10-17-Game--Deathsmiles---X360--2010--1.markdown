I picked up Deathsmiles on the release date, and I've been playing
it every day since. Today, I've decided I will be putting it on my
"play once a month" rotation, rather than my "play once a day"
rotation. The occasion: 1CCs.

I cleared Xbox 360 mode with Rosa a while back finishing with
67,814,085 points. At the time, I was #54 out of the other Rosa
players in the same mode.

For a while, I worked on clearing with Casper, but only managed
to get to the second castle stage (not to the final boss) with
45,286,742 points and #29 out of Casper players. After hitting a
wall, I decided I didn't need to clear with every character right
now and I'd rather try another mode.

This morning, I cleared Mega Black Label Xbox 360 mode with
Rosa with 249,250,914 points. I was #7 out of Rosa players and #26
out of all players. Yum!

Deathsmiles is a very cool game. I really enjoyed the last few
months of intense play and I'm sure I'll enjoy picking it up every
once in a while.
