We saw this movie advertised at the beginning of another and it
seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren't even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn't utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.
