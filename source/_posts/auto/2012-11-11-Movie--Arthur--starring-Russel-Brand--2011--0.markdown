This was a cute movie with a pretty unique plot. The main girl was
cute and wholesome. I feel like the ending was a bit empty though,
because other than going to AA there was no explanation of how
Arthur changed. Th end of the movie suggested that Arthur's only
problem was that he drank a lot (and perhaps having so many
resources exacerbated the impact of that), but didn't deal at all
with his lack of knowledge, etc.
