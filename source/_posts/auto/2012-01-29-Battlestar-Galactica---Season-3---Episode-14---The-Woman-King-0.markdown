This was an interesting episode about space racism. That plot
line was kind of cool, but I was hoping that there would be more
to the brief appearance we saw of Caprica Six.

On the subject of space racism, I think it is strange how whole
planets are casually stereotyped in the show. This is very common
thing in science fiction, but it really doesn't make sense. Given
how diverse opinions and culture are on our planet, it seems
strange to expect it to be any different. The only thing BSG has
on its side is that the planet were originally colonized by
(presumably) culturally homogenous "tribes" and thus could have
maintained their distinct (and cohesive) identities; although
that seems like a stretch given the length of time the colonies
existed.
