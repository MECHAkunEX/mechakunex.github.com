Mrs. Patmore says something so funny to the young people:
"You're all in love with wrong people!" I was also very
interested in the idea of Daisy leaving and taking charge. I
like her a lot.

Thomas is a very interesting character: he can be very wicked,
but he's also extremely sympathetic to modern mores that resent
the prejudice he receives.
