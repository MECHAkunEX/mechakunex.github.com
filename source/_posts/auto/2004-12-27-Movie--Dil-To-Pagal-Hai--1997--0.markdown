I watched another good Bollywood movie, Dil To Pagal Hai. It stars
Karishma Kapoor, Kareena's older sister, and Madhuri Dixit who
reminds me of Rani Mukherjee.

The movie is a fairly clever. The biggest disappointment with it
was that there was little tradition style outfits and dancing,
which has become my favourite aspect of these movies. Still it was
very cute, and Amanda cried at the end.
