Although technically just a month later, it feels like there is a
big gap between this episode and the last. It is interesting the
way they've driven the family back together, solved a few
problems, and created more. There's a very fluid flow to the
show, where there are many balls in the air that get caught at
regular rates, but just as new ones go up. I'm most curious about
the Matthew and Edith plot lines.
