I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man's
stage. She killed a penguin! She's getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time... something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.

I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn't have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.

Total time: 1:40
