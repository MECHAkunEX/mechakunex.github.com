I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon's
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.

In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.

I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn't love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.
