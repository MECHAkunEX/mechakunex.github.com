This was an interesting movie... to see things from the Pegasus'
perspective and to learn a little bit more the Cylons and in
particular the first war. It wasn't really like what I expected,
unfortunately. I think the biggest let down is that it doesn't
really connect to any of the plot lines that are going on in
current times, besides the ominous-ness around Starbuck.
