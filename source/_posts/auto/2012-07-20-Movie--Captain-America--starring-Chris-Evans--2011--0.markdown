For some reason I had lower expectations for this movie than recent
super hero movies I've seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning... like when he jumped on the grenade... and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn't really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I'm excited to see The Avengers!
