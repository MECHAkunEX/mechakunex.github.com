We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he'd be weak, but he wasn't), then we went to Sting
Chameleon's stage and got the Armor upgrade. I'm not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te----dious!

Total time: 1:28
