Today I had a successful run at the slot machines, I went from
2,781 tokens to 4,361 tokens. I tried a few more times later in
the day, but haven't made any progress yet. Wow! I got two
*REDACTED*pots in Super Victory Mode! Now I have 12,556 tokens. Going
into to Super Victory Mode for one round is depressing. I'm going
to leave it playing the slots during the night to see if in the
long-run I can come out ahead. [ed: Upon waking up... 1 token.]
