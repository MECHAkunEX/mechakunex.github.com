I'm disappointed the movie didn't use the plot-point about the
"traitor" that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It's a cool
idea.

I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile... I can't imagine the audience really being excited about
it.

Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It's very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn't as touching.
