This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren't totally showing, it gets a little real and that's
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.
