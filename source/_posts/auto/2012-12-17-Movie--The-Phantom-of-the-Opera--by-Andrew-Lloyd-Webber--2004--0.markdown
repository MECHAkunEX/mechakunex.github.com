This movie was amazing. This visuals are crazy. The actors and
actresses are beautiful. Wow. I think my favourite moments are:
- when Christine is first going down to the Phantom's lair,
because the pull of the camera is so cool.
- the song "Masquerade" and its dance number---crazy.
Minnie Driver was great, too.
