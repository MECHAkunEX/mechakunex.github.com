I just finished the book. I thought the ending was very exciting
but a little bit disappointing because we don't find out what the
feels are of all the "bad guys" who gave up---like Ferris, etc. The
attitudes of the guards was very interesting. The very ending when
they are planning the rebuilding is cool. However, it's unclear why
they think they'll be able to prevent the same thing from
happening... there's a little bit alluded to with the revision of
the Constitution. I think I would have liked a little bit more of a
vision of Utopia. Overall, it was definitely a masterpiece.
