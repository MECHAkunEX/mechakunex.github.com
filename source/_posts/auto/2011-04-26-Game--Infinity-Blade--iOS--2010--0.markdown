Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I'd heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.

I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven't
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won't play it
again.

I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.

I'm glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don't like it. It's too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.
