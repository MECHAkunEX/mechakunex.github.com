I played Yie Ar Kung-Fu for my Famicom tonight. I got it when I
bought the Famicom and I read that it was one of the first
fighting games.

It's not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy's skull and it doesn't register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.

But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.
