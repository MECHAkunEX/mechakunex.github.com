This was a CRAZY episode. The whole plot line is pretty cool and
exciting, but I kind of wish there was more in it. For example,
Holmes doesn't defend himself at all, but it would great for him
to do so. I loved that he was in contempt of court, but we don't
know what he said. There were lots of clever moments like that. I
loved the way Moriarty explained that social engineering is more
effective than hacking. I thought the ending was far too obvious,
especially with regard to Holmes enlisting Molly's help. In that
respect it is obvious, but on the other hand it is ridiculous
that there's going to be an explanation for how he survived,
tricked the people at morgue (presumably Molly just did it?),
etc. I'm a bit pessimistic about where the show will go from
here. The ending is so "Mission Impossible" in its incredulity,
that I could imagine Moriarty not really being dead too. The show
has upped the stakes so much, it seems like they can't really go
back to pedestrian plots.
