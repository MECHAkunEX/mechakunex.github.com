Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan's Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight... including all four bottles.

Total time: 4:43
