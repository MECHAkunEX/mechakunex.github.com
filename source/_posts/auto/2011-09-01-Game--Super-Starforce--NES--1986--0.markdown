This sounded like a really cool game: a combination of a shooter
and an adventure game where you travel through connected stages,
etc. Unfortunately, I found it impossible to understand what I was
supposed to do. I intend to give it another chance, maybe after
reading a manual, but I couldn't cope with it when I tried it the
first time.
