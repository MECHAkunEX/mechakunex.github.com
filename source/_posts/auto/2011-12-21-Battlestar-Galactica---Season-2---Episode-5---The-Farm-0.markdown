In the fleet, I thought it was crazy that Adama didn't
immediately apologize for Tigh's behavior and fix it. I would
have expected him to have disagreed more fundamentally with
him. His conversation about Boomer was also interesting. They are
doing a really interesting job trying to present the Cylons as
somewhat sympathetic characters... at least the Sharons. The
President's actions were fascinating as well, especially her
reluctant (but required) offering of blessings.

On Caprica, the concept of the Farm was horrific. I'm glad that
Starbuck is getting back. I thought it was neat that we've met a
new Cylon. Now it will be a big "dun-dun-daaa" moment when we see
another copy of him on the fleet and the people there won't know
what we do.
