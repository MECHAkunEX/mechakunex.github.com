I played today for a little more than thirty minutes. We got to
the final boss rush, but I didn't have enough skill to beat them,
and then when I got to the continue screen I accidentally
selected "Stage Select" rather than "Continue" so was put back at
the beginning of Wily's Castle. In frustration, I quit. I
understand why this option is there---so you can gave E
tanks. But I was very annoyed that it was default and it took so
long to restart the game back to where I was.

Total time: 3:45
