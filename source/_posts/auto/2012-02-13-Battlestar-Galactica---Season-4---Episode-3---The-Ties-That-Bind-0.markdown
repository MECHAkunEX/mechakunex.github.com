This was a crazy episode. First of all, it's nuts what is going
on on Starbuck's ship. She has to find Earth, but how? How long
will they be gone? Second, I'm glad Lee is so honest and a
defender of freedom and justice; however, I think that we're
going to be told that his actions have ultimately bad
consequences because Laura is so good. Third, oh man, I can't
believe Kali would have killed herself, or was she trying to kill
her son? And then Tori (sp?) killed her? I get the impression
that she has really embraced her Cylon side and thinks the humans
are in the wrong in a lot of ways. (I noticed that she seemed to
have Cylon strength. I hope she'll free/connect with Caprica
Six.) And finally, it sucks what is going on with the good
Cylons. :(
