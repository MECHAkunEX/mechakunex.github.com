I played for about four hours tonight. I got to the gate of Prison
Island. The whole High Entia concept is pretty cool... especially
that there is this giant civilization that's totally disconnected
from others beneath it on the monster. The message at the Tomb was
very interesting too... I wonder what the ancestor's plans were
regarding the genetic destiny of their people?

I really enjoyed seeing the waterfall in the forest. It was very
magnificent. My son was very impressed too.

Exploring the Entia capital was very confusing because the arrow
points in the direction of the destination, not the teleporter
that you have to use to get to it. It was very confusing. When I
was exploring these big empty places with very same-y textures and
models, it made me think how much this game is like mid to late
PS2 games in terms of what it tries to do technically. Rather than
having detailed environments, it often has very large environments
with big draw distances as a way to show, for example.

Total time: 15:19
