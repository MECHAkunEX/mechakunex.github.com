I played for about four hours tonight. I got to the gate of Prison
Island. The whole High Entia concept is pretty cool... especially
that there is this giant civilization that's totally disconnected
from others beneath it on the monster. The message at the Tomb was
very interesting too... I wonder what the ancestor's plans were
regarding the genetic destiny of their people?

Total time: 15:19
