I love the Sunleth Waterscape music from the first game. They
reused it in SW 400AF. It is really funny that Serah scolds the
mini-flan. Hah! I like that when you change times, it preserves
where you were in the area, including if you had a chocobo. My
temporal clock puzzle solver is really handy. Oerba 300AF was
fun... lots of the little puzzles. [026:19:37 Frags 67/160 Lvl
