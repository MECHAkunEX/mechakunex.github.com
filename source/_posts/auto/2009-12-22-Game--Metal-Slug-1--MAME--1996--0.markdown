Last night I played through Metal Slug for the Neo-Geo. I didn't
do very well: I got 508k points and used 28 continues. Ouch. It
was really fun though. The graphics in this game are /amazing/! I
have a hard time thinking of a modern game that is as
beautiful. The only real problem with the game is that shooting
diagonally is a big pain, but I probably just need practice. I
can't wait to play it again or play sequels!
