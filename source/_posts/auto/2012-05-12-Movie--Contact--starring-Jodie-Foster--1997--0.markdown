I love this movie. It's so inspirational and moving. I particularly
like the deep connection between it and the Gospel. I think it hits
the nail on the head in so many ways and is incredibly
pro-religion, of a sorts. I've read the book and I like both of
them for different reasons. It's hard to say a lot about a movie I
just gush over.
