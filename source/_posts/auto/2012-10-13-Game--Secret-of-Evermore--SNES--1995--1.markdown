I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn't get
passed the title screen... it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.

Round time: 1:06
Total time: 2:00
