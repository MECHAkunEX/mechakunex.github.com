My son requested this again and I got all the awards on the second
level then got all the things on the third, except the medal and
the speed trophy. I found it un-intuitive to figure out how to do
the time course. I also find this game to control incredibly
sloppily. The character just swishes around all the time, it is
incredibly obnoxious and hard to deal with.

Total time: 1:09
