I thought this was an adorable movie. Rachel McAdams is really
beautiful and does a great job being tough, yet sensitive and
feminine. It's very funny and heart-warming. It has a nice romantic
sub-plot as well as being exciting and uplifting. It really just
made us happy when we watched it. I highly recommend it as a fun,
funny movie for a boring night!
