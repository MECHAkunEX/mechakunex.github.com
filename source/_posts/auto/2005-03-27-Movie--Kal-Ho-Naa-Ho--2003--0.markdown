Kal No Naa Ho stars Sharhukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta.

Accidentally, I rented a bootleg DVD. So, it was blurry, and I
think some parts were cut, and the subtitles were not on the
songs.

Even with this bumble, I can say that the story was cute and the
characters were interesting. Unfortunately, most of the songs were
pretty bad. There were two towards the end (the first when Preity
falls in love; and some other) that were actually good though.

Recommendation: Decent, but bear through the first few songs and
get a good copy.
