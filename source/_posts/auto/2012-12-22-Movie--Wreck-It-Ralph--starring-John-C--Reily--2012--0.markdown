This was a brilliant movie. All the cameos, references, and jokes
related to video games were lots of fun. The story was pretty cute
too. I saw it with my two kids and they enjoyed it a lot. I liked
the music a lot, especially the AKB48 song.

The short at the beginning of the movie was beautiful and made me
cry. =)
