I played for a little less than an hour tonight. I gained a level
by killing the gargoyle and then all the sentinels again---I
wanted to get all the chests... I forgot one. Then it took me a
while to figure out how to get to the chapel. I fought my way to
the fog gate, but then ran out of time for the night, so I walked
back. I wanted to do an epic jump, but misjudged the distance and
plummeted to my death. Nice.

TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
