I played this for about 15 minutes today. This is one of those
older NES games with really spotty controls but lots of
interesting ideas, that really doesn't work super well. On the
first level you have to wander around a whole bunch of screens
looking for which star block to shoot five times to open a secret
door. I didn't find the controls and mechanics very appealing, so
I think that's it for me.

Total time: 0:14
