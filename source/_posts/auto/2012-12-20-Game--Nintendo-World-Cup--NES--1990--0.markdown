These TECHNOS games feel so good. I like the dynamics in this
game and the way it feels great to tackle your opponent. I really
enjoy more abstract sports games like this. I don't know if I
wouldn't like the more modern, realistic sports games... I
presume I wouldn't, but I haven't really played them. One thing
about this game though, is that I don't think it could sustain
playing it for a long sitting. I played for a little more than
thirty minutes and that seems like the right amount of time. I
think I will keep at it and beat it... maybe?
