I play this while my son watched today. I spent twenty minutes
going through Stone Man's stage. I got to him and was doing pretty
well, but the Mega Buster wasn't powerful enough against him. The
spinning things are the worst... they crowd you and you can't
shoot them while they are touching you. It stinks, you have to
draw them away and then jump n shoot them.
