I played through WarioWare: Touched! and had a chance with all of
the games. It is really fun, just like /WarioWare: Smooth Moves/
for the Wii.

This is the perfect game for someone with ADD, especially once
you unlock the Megamix and can sit on one screen and go through
the whole variety of games. I really enjoyed the retro games, but
I was a little annoyed when the control was really different than
the original game, because I felt stupid being so bad at them
initially. I thought the mic-based games were all very lazy and
easily the worst part of the game. my wife and I played the
Ping-Pong game, which was an incredibly clever use of the dual
screens of the DS.

Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot; I'll keep it around to play
whenever I need something quick to fool around with.
