Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.

Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don't
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff. 

Normal games can't be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don't give instant, infinite
respawns.

This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next. 

(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)

Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them... it is horrifically bad.

Total time: 0:51
