I've been reading this book for a few weeks. It's just
terrible.

It's about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of *REDACTED* and then a series of questions underneath it
like "What does X mean?" "What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?" "What does Y mean?" etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say "follow the
Prophet" and the questions will be something like "What does it
/really/ mean to follow?" "No, REALLY what does it mean?"

I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn't want to
express them clearly because he's afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.

Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he's implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn't actually say this.

In addition to this frivolous questions, there's saccharine
comments like, "Man this Book of *REDACTED* is pretty important, huh? I
can't believe it's so great" that sound like staged humility.

It's plausible that this guy's other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don't think he can use the commentary format effectively.
