I remember playing this game as a kid and thinking it was cool. I
just remember that it is an Action RPG. I played today for an
hour with my son and we beat the first dungeon. It's very
fun. There's a little too much grinding... I feel like I can't
move forward and search, but I have to consciously try to get
money and EXP. But, it's fun. The charge shot is essential for
staying out of harm, but it makes you less flexible, so it's a
nice mechanic to put you in stressful situations.
