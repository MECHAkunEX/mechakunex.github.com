I spent some time grinding today (about an hour) and then got all
the Twinkling Shards I needed to fully upgrade my Giant armor and
the Giant's Hammer. It was pretty awesome once I did that. I then
fought the two bosses... I died the first time, but the second I
was more aggressive and got them down pretty quickly. After
getting the Lordvessel, I avenged the girl and advanced the
story. I feel like the end is in sight. I played for almost three
hours.

TODO list:
- Go through New Londo Ruins + Abyss
- Upgrade Black Bow to +10 fire
- Upgrade Shield to +15
- Upgrade Murakumo to +10 fire and get the strength (28) to use it
- Fight the Black Hydra in Ash Lake
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Dragon Valley
