My little sister wanted to watch this movie tonight, so we watched
it together. I thought it was very cool and pretty trippy. I don't
think Johnny Depp was very good in it though... he was too much
like *REDACTED* Sparrow, but looked really weird and had a funny
voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the
best, they were just so odd. It was cool.
