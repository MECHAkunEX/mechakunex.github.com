Fida stars Kareena Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, and Jai Malhotra. Kareen
was amazing acting as a cold, heartless woman and was dressed very
well throughout the movie. Fardeen looked liked he was trying a bit
to hard to be "suave." And, Jai portrayed a man crumbling and going
mad very well, through his transition from being cutesy in love, to
crazy with pain.

The story was interesting, but seemed to happen a bit too
quickly.
