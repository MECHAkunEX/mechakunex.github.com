I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.

The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.

The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I'm glad that the characters realize this
too.

It's funny because when she's in the field, it's like she's in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.

The real moment of Katniss' catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.

The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.

I find the term "Mockingjay" used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.

Katniss' impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)

I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.

I'm stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol... tense!
