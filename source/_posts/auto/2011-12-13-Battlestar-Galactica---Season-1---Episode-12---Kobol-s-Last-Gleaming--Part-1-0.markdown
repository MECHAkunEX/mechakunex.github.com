This was a neat episode. I liked the way the expressed such awe
over finding Kobol. It would be like finding Atlantis but much
much more significant. I don't really feel like the episode was
"Part 1" of anything though, because it wasn't sufficiently
cliff-hangery to make me really need to watch the next part
directly.
