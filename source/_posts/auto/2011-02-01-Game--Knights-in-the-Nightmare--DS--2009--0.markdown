Not as complicated as the tutorial makes it seem, but still really
complicated and fun

The story was incomprehensible to me after about 5 scenes and it
took too long to read, so I started skipping it, but that seems
like a bad decision in retrospect.

It is very hard to tell how good your decisions are for the long
run

Some of the controls are really bad---like turning your knights

I don't yet understand how height works because, for example, magic
users can't seem to launch projectiles "down" even though that
makes sense
