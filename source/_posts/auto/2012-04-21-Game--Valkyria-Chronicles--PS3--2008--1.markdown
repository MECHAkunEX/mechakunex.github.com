I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that'll be my
method... whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I'll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.

So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting... there's a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can't wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.

I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the "Imps", which I reckon means "Imperials." Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.

Total: 2:49
