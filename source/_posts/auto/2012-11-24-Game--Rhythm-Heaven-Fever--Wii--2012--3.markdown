I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn't make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn't get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I'm doing terribly, but
it doesn't communicate to me in any way what I'm doing wrong. In
addition, I'm now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games... even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can't. Argh.

Total time: 1:38
