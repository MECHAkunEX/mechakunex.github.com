I really liked this episode a lot. They did a great job showing
the nobility of the pilots in both fighting for their friend and
bowing to the moral pressure of the President. I thought it was
also amazing how Starbuck got the Cylon ship ready for flight and
marked it as well. I hope it will be really useful for them to
research the Cylons, both biologically and mechanically. I'm
excited about where this can go.
