I've been reading every day, but I haven't read anything I've felt
worth commenting on. It's a very interesting book. The Danish and
Italian sections were curious, but seem to end in a non-conclusion
because the ballet innovations there didn't drastically change
things. I'm excited about the transition to the Russian world.
