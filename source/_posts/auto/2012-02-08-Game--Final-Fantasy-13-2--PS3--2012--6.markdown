I searched around Bresha for the second Graviton Core but didn't
have any luck. I will try to fight Atlas w/o the machine first and
see if that helps. He totally destroyed me. I went Oerba 200 AF
but only found a Wild Artefact, used it in Academia 400AF to get
to Yaschas Massif 100AF. Still no Graviton Cores... very
unproductive day. I really don't want to cheat though. [021:37:42
