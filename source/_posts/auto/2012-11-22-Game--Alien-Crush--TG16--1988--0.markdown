I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the "living" board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it's not too hard to get used
to.

I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there's not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don't really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &
weren't learning experiences.

I enjoy the game a lot, although I'm not sure how much I
like *this* game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.

Total time: 0:48
