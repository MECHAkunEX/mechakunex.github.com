Today I played through this whole game... throughout the day... a
total of seven hours and eleven minutes! Woah! This is a great
game. I love these escape puzzle games.

There are fifty puzzles, so each took an average of eight minutes,
but I'd say most were either really short... like one or two
tries... or very long. I had to seek hints about five times. The
ones that were the hardest were ones where you need to push a
block half a tile, or cover a monster spawning location with a
block so it would appear somewhere else, or where you need really
precise timing. The biggest problem with the game is when Lolo
gets stuck on edges of the grid. Nevertheless, It's a lot of fun
to play.

The graphics are simple and to the point, but super adorable. I
love the way Lolo runs.

My son had fun helping me and giving me advice during the game.

There's not much more to say about it, but it's very enjoyable.

Total time: 7:11
