I tried to play Ikari Warriors on my Famicom. I wanted to play it
because I've heard it talked about some many times. But it was
excruciatingly slow. I couldn't tell if it was the fault of my
PowerPak or the normal behavior, but when I looked at videos
online, it didn't seem like it was normally faster. It reminded me
a little bit of Iron Tank, which I remember liking.
