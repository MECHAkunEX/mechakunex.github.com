This is a cross between Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania but with
terrible art and really loose, sloppy game play. Reading about the
game on Wikipedia makes it seem so cool, but the mechanics are
just way too bad to push through to what sounds like it would be
good. I have no connection in my history to this game, so it is
easy to say "Who cares?"
