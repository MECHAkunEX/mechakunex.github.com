One of my favourite games ever is /Earthbound/ for the Super
Nintendo. A few years ago I heard about a sequel coming out for
the Gameboy Advance. I obsessively checked video game news sites
until it was clear that it was not going to come out in
America. Luckily, in the middle of October of this year, Mother 3
was translated by fans and a patch released for the GBA ROM.</p>

I just finished playing and, man, it is awesome. It recreates the
feel of the original and pushes it up a few notches and adds a
whole bunch of unique stuff. I was very impressed and
satisfied.
