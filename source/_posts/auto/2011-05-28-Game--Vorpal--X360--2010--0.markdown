I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.

It's a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.

I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.

I was playing as Xiphias and I'd never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC'd his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.

I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don't anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.
