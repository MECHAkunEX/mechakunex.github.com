I've been using a lot of Phoenix Downs since I got to the Yassaf
Machif (?). Seems like a bad thing. It's pretty crazy to see Hope
as an older dude. I accidentally closed the Bresha gate and had to
redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It's pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won't do that good thing and you'll
drastically change what they did---probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]
