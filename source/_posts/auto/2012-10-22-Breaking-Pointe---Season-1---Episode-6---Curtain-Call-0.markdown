We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I'm glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he'll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.
