The first page of the book is the sort of unreasonable Book of
*REDACTED* historicity that gets *REDACTED*s in the biggest trouble. It
bothers me that there is simply no evidence in the Book of *REDACTED*
itself for some of his claims... such as the "untold millions" of
Jaredites and that they "trafficked in many manufactured goods."
