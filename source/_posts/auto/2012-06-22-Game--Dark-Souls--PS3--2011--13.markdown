I played for an hour and a half today. I got to my goal stats and
then got a ton (60!) fire buff items. I went against the bosses
with Iaito + flame, but was totally creamed. Ouch. I'm wondering
what weapons I should try now. I think I will get Havel's Ring and
the Giant Blacksmith Hammer and go from there.

TODO list:
- Go to Demon Ruins
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley
