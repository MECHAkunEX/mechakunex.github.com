This is a cool spy-action movie. I like how it emphasizes the
"soft" part of spy work (but not as much as something like
/Spygame/.) And, I think the fight scenes are really cool because
they are so slow and feel realistic. In a strange way, her
controlled fighting makes it almost less exciting, because she
seems so confident and in control all the time. There was lots of
neat camera work---mainly during the chase sequences. And, the
structuring of the story telling (in the beginning, she's narrating
to someone else) is interesting. The one thing I think could have
been a lot better about the movie was the final reveal: the reason
for the betrayal could have been more meaningful and cooler. But,
overall, it was a pretty rad movie. I can imagine watching more
movies with Gina Carano starring.
