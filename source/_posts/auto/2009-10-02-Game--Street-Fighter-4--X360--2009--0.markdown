When I was growing up, I really liked fighting games like /Street
Fighter/, but I was horrible at them, whether I played the
computer or another person. I decided earlier this year that I
would learn how to be good, so I bought Street Fighter IV and I
practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz
Street Fighter 4 FightStick Tournament Edition Arcade
stick. Heaven! It is so sweet to use for this game and some many
others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!
