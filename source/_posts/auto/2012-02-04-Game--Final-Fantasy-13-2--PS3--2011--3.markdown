They do a really good job communicating Serah's changing feelings
about her task... from meeting Lightning to saving the future. It
is getting hard to keep track of what episode I am in. I think I
found the Casino (mini games!) and a place that will lead to
Lightning at the end of the game. Some of these assets are clearly
re-used, because they are places from FF13, but they look so
different, I don't see how this is any cheaper to make than a new
game. The Moogle Toss system is funny. It has just hit me that the
Preemptive Strike bonus is a lot weaker in this game: just about
half staggered and Haste. I got to Serendipity for the first
time... Chocobo races!!! The Proto fal'Cie in Academia are
crazy. The Academia part is really annoying because you are
overwhelmed with monsters, but they don't give any gil or CP. I
just noticed you can get 6 digits of HP. I intend to go to the
fragment reward place every day. I decided to keep track of my
levels differently, by adding them up because I won't go past 60
for a while. That also means that I won't need to keep two
numbers, since they will be the same. I made a mistake when I
expanded Serah's Crystarium. I maxed out my two main roles and
should have gotten another role, but instead expanded my
accessories. Oh well. It is so tempting to not read about some of
the mechanical details... like how many levels you can get
(presumably 99 in each?) what the fragment skills are,
etc. [014:06:26 Frags 21/160 Lvl 168]
