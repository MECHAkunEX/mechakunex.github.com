I know I don't seem the type, but I really liked sports games on
the NES and SNES. In particular, I have very fond memories of
baseball games. I got the Japanese version of this game with my
Famicom, so I popped it in and played a few innings. It is
definitely a very weak and primitive game. I will try the later
versions though, because maybe it got tighter and faster.
