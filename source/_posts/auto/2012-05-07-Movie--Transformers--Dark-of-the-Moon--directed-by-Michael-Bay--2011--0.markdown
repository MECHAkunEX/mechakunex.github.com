Another stupid, crazy, spectacle movie. The plot is pretty
incomprehensible, but who cares, or expects better? The visuals
were really amazing. I was kind of annoyed that Megan Fox wasn't in
it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn't work for what they had the girl do, but I don't
see why that was a necessary plot point. Either way, the whole
movie was some good stupid fun.
