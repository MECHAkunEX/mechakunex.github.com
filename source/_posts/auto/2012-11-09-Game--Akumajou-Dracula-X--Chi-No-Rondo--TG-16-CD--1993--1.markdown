I bought a PC Engine and got this game. It is really fun to play
it again, especially without an emulator and save states, so I
have to do it better. Additionally, I've had a lot more
experience with the other early Castlevania games so I'm just
better at playing it. It's really fun and smooth feeling, despite
having classic Casltevania stickiness.

I played only as Richter today and I did all secret exits. I went
from 0 to 1 to 2' to 3' to 4'. I fought the Serpent, the Minotaur,
the Werewolf, and the floaty head thing. It's a lot of fun.

Total time: 1:09
