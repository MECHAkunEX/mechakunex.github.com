I played for about 33 minutes today and basically just learned
that Alicia really is a Valkyria and she's super tough. I lost the
battle pretty hard, because I did a stealth rush and couldn't
defend the forward base. Now that I know where the enemy will be,
I think I will try to pre-place Lancers behind the where the tanks
appear! We'll see tomorrow.

Total: 23:26
