I played two times today. The first time for about 45 minutes and
I got to Stage 9. I found it incredibly difficult to get past the
bone pillars... I just couldn't get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.

I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don't like
that I can't restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.

Total time: 3:01
