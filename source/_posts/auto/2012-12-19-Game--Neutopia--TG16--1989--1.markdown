Later in the day, I played for almost three hours.

I beat up to level 5. I find the game to be so much like LoZ but
bigger in ways that don't make it better.

There are some similar items (like the Rainbow Drop is the same as
the Ladder) and some unique ones (like the Glowing Moss). But
there's a lot that isn't there and what is added isn't great.

The levels are all a lot bigger, but they look too much the same
that they are extremely confusing and kind of frustrating. Same
with the various overworlds.

There are upgrades to your armor and weapon, but they don't really
feel much better because the enemies are getting stronger too. (In
contrast, in LoZ, the enemies in the overworld are all the same
and as you get stronger stuff, you see the same guys more and get
to thrash them.)

The bosses are huge and cool looking, but they take way too long
to kill once you've learned their pattern and can totally avoid
being hit.

Overall, the game just isn't as refined as LoZ. I got over the
problems with the combat with a little more attention, but I feel
like the rest of the game will just be a chore. I don't think I
will finish it.

I bet if I grew up with a TurboGrafx rather than a Nintendo, I
would love this game, but as it stands, it's just meh.

Total time: 3:05
