I played through this on Easy as Blaze and got to the final
boss. The combat feels pretty good in this game, but it has the
normal problems with beat-em-ups: the bosses are impossible unless
you use lots of special attacks, which are drastically
limited. I'm surprised I got so far. On my first continue, I got
to the end of Round 5. On my second, I got to the end of
Round 7. In the third, I got to the final boss. Definitely not
worth playing again, but it wasn't a terrible waste of an hour.

Total time: 0:58
