I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There's so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It's like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I'm a masochist and can't resist. I'll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.

Total time: 3:03
