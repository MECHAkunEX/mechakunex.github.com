Back in May, I bought a copy of S&P for the N64 in Japan. On
Tuesday I bought a US N64 to play it on. Today, I got the
"GameBit" in the mail that I needed to region mod it to play
Japanese N64 games.

I started playing S&P and it took a while to get used to the
controls again... especially because before I played on my arcade
stick (under an emulator) and now I was using the actual control
scheme. It felt a little strange but I started to get used to it
quickly.

I played about 14 minutes and got: 5,343,930 pts, 11m13s, and 531
enemies. I died at the final stage of the final boss of the first
level. I remember it taking a while to realize that I had to
shoot the glowing spot under water the first time too...
