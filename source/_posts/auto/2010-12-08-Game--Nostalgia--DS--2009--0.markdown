Since the flood, I haven't been able to play my normal game
regime. I decided to play a DS game, since that still works. I
picked up Nostalgia.

This game is great. It is basically Indiana Jones the RPG. The
alternate history world is really fun. The battle system is
straight-forward and classic, but still fun. The skill system is
interesting, although I didn't find it that necessary to actually
use the skills much. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot.

The main problem is that after 12 hours, I had to stop because
I hit a well-known glitch in the game that stops your
progression. I read a few people on forums talking about the
problem and having to return the game, etc. Very disappointing,
but it was a fun experience while it lasted.
