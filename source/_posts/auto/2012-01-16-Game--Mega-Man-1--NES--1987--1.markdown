Played through Cut Man, Guts Man, and Ice Man. Guts Man's dropping
platform section was really rough, but nothing compared to Ice
Man's two screens of disappearing blocks followed by awful
circling death platforms.

After dinner, I played through the rest of the game. Wily's Castle
was insane. The hardest parts were the Wily Fortress 4 and Yellow
Devil. I did Yellow Devil sooo many times and I didn't use the
Thunder Beam or the pause trick. I have to admit that used the pause
trick on the final four robot masters and Wily.
