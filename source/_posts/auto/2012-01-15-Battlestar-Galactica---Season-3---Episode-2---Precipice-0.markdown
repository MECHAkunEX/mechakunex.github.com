This was a real intense episode. I couldn't believe that they
would kill the President. It makes me feel real bad for Baltar,
because he's so defenseless and the only thing he can really do
is let them kill him, which wouldn't accomplish anything. The
whole situation with Starbuck is probably the most insane one
though. I'm glad that Sharon is trusted though. Jeepers.
