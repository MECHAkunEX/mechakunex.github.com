I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell... a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!
