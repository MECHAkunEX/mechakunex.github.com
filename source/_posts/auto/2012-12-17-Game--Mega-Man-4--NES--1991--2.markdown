I played through Skull Man's stage tonight (my son is very
fascinated with his appearance.) It was a fun level and I managed
to get an E tank and lots of 1-UPs on it. I had 4 lives for the
boss fight but was totally destroyed. I feel like in these later
Mega Man games, it is impossible to beat bosses out of
order. It's a bit disappointing that it isn't as free, but it
doesn't detract that much from the experience.

Total time: 1:08
