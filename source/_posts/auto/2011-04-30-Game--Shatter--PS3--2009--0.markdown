I just finished Shatter.

This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a "bullet hall" influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It's really a blast to
play.

The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.

I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.

The only thing I didn't like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball's movement on them.
