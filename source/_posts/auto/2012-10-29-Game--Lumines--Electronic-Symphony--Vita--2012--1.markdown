I played for about an hour today on one run. I got a very high
score. I don't know what it would mean to "beat" this game. In
addition, every time I play, even when I last longer, I don't
really feel like I did anything good since you can manage to get
back down to a blank screen so often. Another thing strange about
this game is that the difficulty never really changes, I just
feel like I keep going and going and going but the soundtrack
changes. It's odd.

I'm going to mark the game "Done" but play it whenever I need to
run down my Vita's battery.

Total time: 1:24
