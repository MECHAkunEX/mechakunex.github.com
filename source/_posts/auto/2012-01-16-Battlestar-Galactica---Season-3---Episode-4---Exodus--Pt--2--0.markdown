This was a great conclusion. The exodus was incredibly epic and
they did a good job preserving a lot of what was really great
from the space era of the show... like just having one ship, etc.

I'm not really that surprised that Starbuck's baby was a
fake... the facts just didn't add up. And in particular, at the
very beginning of the episode I thought to myself that she
couldn't be a half-Cylon because otherwise the Cylons would be
much less excited about Hera.

I'm glad that Gaius is okay... I presume he will be living with
the Cylons and Hera. I wonder what will happen to him.

Tigh's situation was pretty rough too. Too bad, but Helen was
very untrustworthy.

What an awesome show.
