Today I played for about two hours and beat the Four Kings (on my
first try! with only 5 healing potions! boom!) and then spent a
lot of money upgrading my shields to +10 and buying Green Shards
to begin upgrading my bow and my next sword. I got myself over to
the Duke's Archives for the next part of the game, but I won't
play much longer tonight, despite having the time.

TODO list:
- Upgrade Shield to +15
- Upgrade Black Bow to +10 fire
- Upgrade Murakumo to +10 fire and get the strength (28) to use it
- Fight the Black Hydra in Ash Lake
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Dragon Valley
