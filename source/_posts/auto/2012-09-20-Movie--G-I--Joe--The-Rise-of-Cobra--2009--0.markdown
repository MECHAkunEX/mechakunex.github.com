I had low expectations for this movie, other than it having crazy
special effects and action sequences. It exceeded my
expectations. There were some badly composed and lighted effects,
but overall it was pretty awesome. The chase in Paris was really
cool... although I thought the Acceleration Suits were kind of
dumb looking... I would have preferred something that looked more
like the suit in Vanquish; something less bulky.

I described the movie to my wife as taking place in the same
universe as Metal Gear... and it was pretty accurate, especially
because in this movie nanomachines play such a large role.
