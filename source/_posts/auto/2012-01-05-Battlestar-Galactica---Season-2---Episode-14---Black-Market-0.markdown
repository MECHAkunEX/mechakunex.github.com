This was an interesting episode. It was mainly about Lee and his
psyche. I'm not sure I really understand what he was supposed to
be feeling; perhaps that his life isn't really fulfilling because
he doesn't have anyone to share it with. I thought the market
stuff was interesting, although I disagree with their
presentation of it as a necessary evil, because trade is mutually
beneficial. The main problem is that by the government making it
illegal, they let criminals thrive because there is no court
system to enforce their contracts. It's the same thing with drugs
in the USA. Unfortunate.
