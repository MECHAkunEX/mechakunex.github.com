I've been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.

This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.

The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It's a blast to play. I'd like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)

I have three problems with the game.

First, the controllers aren't precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that's required.

Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.

Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.

But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.
