I played for like two hours tonight. The "gameplay loop" of this
game is very repetitive. I feel like my use of the fighting system
is so boring, but so effective too that it doesn't matter. I still
like the feeling of flying through the air though. I feel like
that game is too long and I've already played it for so long. I
had a lot of frustrating times tonight when I needed to swing the
camera fast and couldn't.

Total time: 5:02
