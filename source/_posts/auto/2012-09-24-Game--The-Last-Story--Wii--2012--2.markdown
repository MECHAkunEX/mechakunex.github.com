I played for about two and half hours and got back to the town. I
find it very charming how much this story is like Aladdin or a
romantic comedy. It was also neat how there was a monster
summoning spot right before a boss fight, almost like if you were
having trouble you could grind there, because the game is
normally very closed and linear. It's a neat structure.

TODO Go back to the mysterious island and go behind the entrance
where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.
