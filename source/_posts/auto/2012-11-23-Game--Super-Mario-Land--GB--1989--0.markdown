I played this for one run of about ten minutes. I got to 1-3. I
could very easily tell that this game was a novelty of its day:
Mario in Portable form! Today, there's no reason to play
this. It's not like it's bad... but the limitations of the Game
Boy are way too awkward to really enjoy it. There are some cool
things though, such as the rolling boulders and the different
enemy types, but there's no reason to play this when you're at
home (or even with the hand-held options that are available
today.)

Total time: 0:09
