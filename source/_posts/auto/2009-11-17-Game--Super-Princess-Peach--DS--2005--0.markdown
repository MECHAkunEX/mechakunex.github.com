During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The "vibe" system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn't proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn't about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn't finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you're in for some frustration and annoyance.
