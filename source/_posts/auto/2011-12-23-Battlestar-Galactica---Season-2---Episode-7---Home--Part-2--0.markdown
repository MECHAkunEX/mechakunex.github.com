I thought this was a really cool episode. It was neat to have the
new Sharon do interesting things and have the people make up, but
the best part was definitely inside the Tomb of Athena. I love
the idea that the symbols of our constellations were already
symbols for the ancient humans and it was a great surprise that
when the 13th tribe found Earth they saw them. What a cool idea.
