I finally beat the Ritter boss fight! Yes! I think it has been
almost 6 months since I started this fight :) In the next fight, I
got him down to 238 but didn't get the final two charge shots
in. I got faked out by the whack-a-mole feint. What else is cool
is this was my first round with him today; a few days ago I played
S&P for about 30 or 40 minutes playing this fight over and over
with no success. (FYI, I normally just play one round.)
