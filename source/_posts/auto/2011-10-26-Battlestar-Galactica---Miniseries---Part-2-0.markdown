I liked a lot of things about this episode.

I really like the concept of Number Six being a character. The
awkwardness of Gaius being the only one who can see her is very
fun.

I think the Cylon's perspective is fascinating. I liked listening
to the guy on the depot talk about how they were serving God by
punishing the Humans for their sins. I thought it was awesome at
the end of the episode how they said they had to find and kill
the Humans or else they would come back some day for revenge.

I thought the revelations about the Human religion and the idea
of the mythic Earth is really cool. It makes you feel like they
could be out there somewhere. The *REDACTED* connection is great
too. I loved what they said the first verse of the Sacred Scrolls
were: "Life here came from out there". They know they are
colonists of somewhere, but don't know where.

It is a fascinating world. I think that's what I like about it.
