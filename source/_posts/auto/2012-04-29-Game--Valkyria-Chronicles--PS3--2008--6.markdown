Another three hours. Today I did a few battles and I realized what
the "reports" I'd seen showing up were... how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service... I mean, the beach vacation... one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.

Total: 16:30
