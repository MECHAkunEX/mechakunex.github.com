I've also been playing Decimation X3.

This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of
control insane. I love it.

The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.

Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it
regularly.
