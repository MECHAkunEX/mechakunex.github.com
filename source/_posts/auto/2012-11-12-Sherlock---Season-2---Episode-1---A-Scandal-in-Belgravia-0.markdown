This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they're texting, there's
the six months she's pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she's actually dead, etc. It's a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson's girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he'd be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I'll be very annoyed that there won't be
any closure in the sixth episode.
