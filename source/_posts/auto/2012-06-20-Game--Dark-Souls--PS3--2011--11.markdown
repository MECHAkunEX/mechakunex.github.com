I played through the rest of the Darkroot Forest and killed the
boss and got some awesome equipment. At first when I tried to get
Pharis' bow, he fell off the cliff and so I didn't get it. But
later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot
higher because of the ring.

TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley
