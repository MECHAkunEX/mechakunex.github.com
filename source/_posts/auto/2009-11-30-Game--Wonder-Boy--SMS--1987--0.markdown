Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.

This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn't get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn't get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
[2,122,630](http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=46&gi=6946&vi=7899), but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)

I used lots of save states and I don't think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn't get to level 10.
