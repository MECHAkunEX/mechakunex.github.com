On my flight back I beat the rest of the missions. They were
really, really hard. Brutally hard. Especially the one where you
couldn't build any new units. It was rough. This game has a really
good difficulty management system... in the beginning it is pretty
tough, but do-able and then near the middle to end it is insane,
but it's all the same rules. It's cool.

The story is totally absurd. But whatever. =)
