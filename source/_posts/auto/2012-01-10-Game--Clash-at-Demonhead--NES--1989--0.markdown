I played Clash at Demonhead for about an hour last night.

This is a really interesting action platforming game. In my mind,
that genre is defined by Mega Man and Metroid if the combat is
projectile based. The thing that is particularly interesting about
it is that it uses a Metroidvania like structure where you have a
large world that you can repeatedly explore and go through. Unlike
Metroid where the gameplay is "uniform", Clash has different modes
where you choose paths on the world map and then do a platform
level. Almost like Mega Man where you choose bosses that are
otherwise disconnected.

As I said, I played for about an hour and in that time, I didn't
really catch the vision of the open world. Instead it just felt
really confusing and mish-mashed together. It makes me wonder if I
would feel Metroid was the same way if I played it totally
fresh.

Additionally, the action is good but not as good as Metroid or
Mega Man. So I've decided to put it down for a while and maybe I
will play it again so I can give it a better chance.
