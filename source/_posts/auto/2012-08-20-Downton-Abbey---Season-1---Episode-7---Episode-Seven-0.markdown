I'm kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O'Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary's backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it's more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I'm still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I'm very curious
how the next season will go, because they've been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.
