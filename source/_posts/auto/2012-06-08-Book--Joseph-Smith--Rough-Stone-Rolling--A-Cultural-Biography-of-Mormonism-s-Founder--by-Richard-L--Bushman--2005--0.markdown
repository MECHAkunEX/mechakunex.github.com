In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
*REDACTED*ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early *REDACTED*ism.
