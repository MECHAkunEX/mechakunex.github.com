My son picked this game out because of its box art and it is in
my "new game queue". I'd been planning on playing it co-op with
my wife, but I couldn't dissuade him from wanting to check it
out. I've never played a Rayman game before, so I didn't know
what to expect other than that it is a platformer.

I found the world to be really cute and the art to be awesome.

I think the controls are really floaty and delayed (especially
the punches). The running doesn't feel quite right either. But
I'd say it is still on par with DKCR, and not totally terrible.

We played two levels. The first I played twice so I could get all
the stuff and the second I was one shiny thing away from the
second bonus. The collectathon in this game seems more fun that
the collectathons in DKCR and I'm not sure if I like them more or
less than NSMBW.

I couldn't figure out how to play multiplayer... maybe I just
needed to have two active controllers. Nor could I understand
what the difference between the characters were. I hope to play
it with my wife eventually, but I probably won't play again for a
while unless the kids request it.

Total time: 0:29
