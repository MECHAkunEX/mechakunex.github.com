I played another five matches in the middle of the day over about
an hour. I discovered a new trick: after expending all your super
kicks (or just getting an advantage), run down the clock so you
win. I found two good ways to run down the clock: First, knock out
a member of the other team and go into the zone that only he
defends and wait. Second, continually to head-butt passes (the AI
never intercepts these). Hah!

At the end of the day I played again for another hour or so and
beat the game. The final few matches were really tough to keep the
ball on my side and I got scored on more than any other matches,
but I was able to win with a bit of abuse. It's a fun game to play
and I can imagine it being more difficult and interesting.

Total time: 3:07
