Hank's relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men---meaning in the government or "public"
sector---namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn't respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus "pure love". The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there's no need for the concept of "love". In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial "trade" and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.

It makes me think of Hayek's comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.
