[This action button review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p%3D2597) of the game captures my feelings about a
lot of the system-overload this game throws at you so early and
the sheer weight of the quests. The comment about the difference
between abilities and skills is very apt---I have no clue what's
going on in that system. Something related is that for a lot of
the game so far I've been killing every enemy in my path, but then
I noticed that a lot of the enemies are just giving me 1 or 2
EXP... what's the point of that? But there doesn't seem to be a
good way to tell what is going to be a good amount of EXP before
hand. It's a bit confusing.

Today, I played for a little over three hours. I advanced the
story quite a bit. I was really annoyed by the lack of a feeling
of progress behind all the numbers. I repeatedly tried to get
past a little path that was blocked by enemies and I seemed to be
dying with no explanation.

I went back to the gem guy to create a whole bunch of gems, but I
don't really know if they are really all that good or if I
shouldn't have spent them all, because I have a lot of gems now
and not enough places to put them.

I'm really conflicted about the battle system. In some ways, it's
no different than a traditional FF or DQ game, because you
generally attack and then use special attacks when you have
enough energy to. But on the other hand, it feels like a lot of
meaningful decision is taken from you. For example, there's an
air of strategy in your positioning, but with huge crowds of
enemies it is so hard to see where you are, where their face is,
etc that being in the front/back/side is almost irrelevant
because you can't reliably tell. The whole
Monado-tells-the-future system being integrated into the combat
is really remarkable and unique. I'm not yet to the point though
where the vision really does me any good because I don't
understand how it is supposed to be canceled.

Basically, at this point, I find the whole game to be really
confusing in the mechanic department. There's a lot that I can do
and I'm treating it like a traditional JRPG, but I feel like I'm
missing something when I do, but I'm not really being punished
for ignoring it, but I'm constantly being flirted with by all
these other weird numbers and concepts. It's just a really
strange game.
