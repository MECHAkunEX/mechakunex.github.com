I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now... even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I'd like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I'm basically done with the game.

Total time: 19:11
