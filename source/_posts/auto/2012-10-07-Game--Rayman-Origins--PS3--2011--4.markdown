I decided that life is too short to play games like Rayman Origins
when there are amazing games I haven't played enough. So I'm
stopping. I did everything possible in the first world and
everything possible in the first half of the second world. The
horrible controls are not worth the adorable setting of the
game... unfortunately.

Total time: 3:03
