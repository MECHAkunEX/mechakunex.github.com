It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn't notice anything wrong with Allison's dancing. I'm
one of the "80% who don't know anything about ballet". It's kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it's all beautiful and can't notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family... she
don't seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.
