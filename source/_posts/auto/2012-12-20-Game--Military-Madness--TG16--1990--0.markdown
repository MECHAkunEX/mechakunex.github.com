I played the first, second, and third levels over about an
hour. I didn't finish the last level.

I enjoyed the game. It is extremely similar to Advance Wars. I
find the interface in Advance Wars to be superior and the game is
more complex, but not in a way that is extremely complex. Both
are very simple, but they allow that simplicity to be used to
create interesting and challenging situations. But, because of
the similarity, I don't feel a great compulsion to play this
game, particularly when it is so inconvenient to do so. (I have a
Japanese PC Engine, so my Hu-Card doesn't work, so I have to
emulate it.)

Maybe if I got deeper into the game, there would be something
unlike about it that would be worth understanding, but after
scanning a FAQ, it doesn't seem so.

I would really like a procedurally generated game like this where
I could play at incredibly small chunks overtime. Until then... I
think I'll abandon it.

Total time: 0:47
