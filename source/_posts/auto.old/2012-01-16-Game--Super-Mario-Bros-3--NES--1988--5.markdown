Over the last week, I played through Super Mario
Bros. 3.

The first two nights I played three worlds and then the others
took a night each. I used Game Genie codes that allow you to start
at a specific world as a form of password. I also used an infinite
lives password so I didn't have to repeat levels, but had to get
through every level as-is. I did not skip any levels.

This is a really amazing game. Although SMB2 defined SMB for me,
when I played SMB3 it really expanded what was possible. Truly a
masterpiece. It makes my thumb hurt from holding down the run
button though. :)
