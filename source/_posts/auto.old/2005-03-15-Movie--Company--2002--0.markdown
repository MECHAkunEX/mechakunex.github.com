Company staring Ajay Devgan, Mohanlal, and Vivek Oberoi is a
fabulous Hindi movie that is very /The Godfather/-esque in its
portrayal of a rising Mumbai gang. I thought the acting and story
were fabulous, and I was pleased by the lack of out-of-place songs
and poor fight scenes.

Highly recommended, but different.
