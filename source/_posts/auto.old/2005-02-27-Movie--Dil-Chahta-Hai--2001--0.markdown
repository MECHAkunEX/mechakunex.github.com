Dil Chahta Hai is very different than most of the Bollywood movies
I've seen so far. It is less silly, although still has many funny
moments. There is actually some intense dramatic action and sad
parts. Although not unique, one thing I liked was having no clue
how or if the couples would get together.

Preity Zinta was beautiful. Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna were very
good-looking.

Highly recommended.
