There were so many fascinating things in this episode. Anyone who
has seen it would agree. The things that are most interesting to
me are that they've consolidated the characters all back on
Galactica---Gaius, Caprica Six, Hera, etc. And it's very
surprising that they've totally killed off a Cylon model. It
seems a bit too transparent of a way to remove an actress. I have
a hard time believing the Cylons would really do it. Although I
suppose it's imaginable that in the longer run one model who take
control of all the others and make itself the only active one.

I think we are meant to think that Starbuck is one of the final
five or something because she's been greatly wronged by the
Cylons and apparently has had this vision. I'm disappointed that
Gaius didn't seem to learn anything from being in the temple.
