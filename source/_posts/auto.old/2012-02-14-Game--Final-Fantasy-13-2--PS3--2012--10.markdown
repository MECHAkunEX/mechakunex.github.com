I haven't been able to play very much the last few days, so I
wanted to do a little today. I went to the Vile Peaks, but it
appears I need to find another time of it. Then I went back to ADW
and filled out its map. I then did some rubber banding at the slot
machine. Ouch. What a waste of time. I'm appalled that the chocobo
races aren't more productive in terms of coin
production. [031:41:19 Frags 86/160 Lvl 349]
