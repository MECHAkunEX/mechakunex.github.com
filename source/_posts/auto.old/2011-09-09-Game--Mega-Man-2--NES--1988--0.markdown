I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley's Castle
today.

I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don't
remember ever getting to Wiley's Castle, and especially not
through it. I'm kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don't normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I'm just remembering it being harder than
it was? I'm not sure.

Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man's
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.

Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don't
think there's anything that isn't polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.

This game is amazing.
