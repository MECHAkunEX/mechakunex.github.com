A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I'll play it again unless I'm totally desperate. I'd rather
just read something on my phone. I don't blame this game though, I
think it's really the fault of the phone.
