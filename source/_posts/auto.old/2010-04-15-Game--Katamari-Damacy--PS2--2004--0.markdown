After Final Fantasy 13, I wanted to play something really
light. Katamari Damacy was a good choice. It's crazy, bizarre, and
really fun. I've heard a lot about it over the past few years and
I was glad to be able to try it out.

I really like the way you collect countries in the ending
sequence. It's funny.
