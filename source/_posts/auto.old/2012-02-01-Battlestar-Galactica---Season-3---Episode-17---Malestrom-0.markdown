This was a strange episode. I feel like this is intended to make
us believe that Starbuck is a Cylon. The phrase "between life and
death" was the biggest thing that made me think that. I found her
background story to be more interesting after seeing it, than I
thought it would be beforehand. Parents like that are so mean. I
can't believe they really exist.
