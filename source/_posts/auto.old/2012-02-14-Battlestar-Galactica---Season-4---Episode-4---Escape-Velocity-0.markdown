Every episode this season has been amazing. This was particularly
cool. Each of the new Cylons is having a little crisis as they
learn about themselves and how they should feel. I find Tory to
be most interesting, because she's fully converted to the
supremacy of Cylons (and the One True God, because of Gaius.)
Lee's character continues to be exemplary. I'm extremely
fascinated by Gaius. I loved how it looked like there was a
miracle going on when Figment Six was picking him up after he was
beat down. The thing with Caprica Six and the Colonel was super
weird though... I found Helen to look really disturbing in her
clothes for some reason... it just looked wrong.
