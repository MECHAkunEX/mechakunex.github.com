The Webisodes were kinda strange.

I knew it! The 13th tribe were totally Cylons! I wonder if Kara
is an Earthling, but there's a difference between Earth Cylons
and Earth Cylons who are part of the 12 Cylons... like they were
the ones who started the Colonial Cylon society but were a
relatively small part of the rest of the Cylons there. And
perhaps the 5 who left the 7 abandoned the original plan and went
to live with the humans casually. I think something like could
explain how Kara and Ellen could both be Cylon-like.

They really threw a wrench in my expectations for the
show... awesome!
