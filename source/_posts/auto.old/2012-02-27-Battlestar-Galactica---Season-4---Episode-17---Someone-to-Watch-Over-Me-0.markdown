Wow, Boomer is a low down good fer nothin'. I totally predicted
that Kara's piano playing friend was her dad and that he wasn't
real. Given that he played that song, it makes me wonder if like
her dad was the only living "Daniel" Cylon---you know, the
artist. Because if he doesn't enter the plot in some way, why
would they tell us about him in the first place, given that it
wasn't really that informative about something else. (Maybe just
that Cavil is a punk.) Also, at the beginning of this episode I
was thinking about how Cavil has been missing most of the season,
at least since the hub was destroyed, and that he doesn't really
have plans that they are getting involved in. There's only two
episodes left!
