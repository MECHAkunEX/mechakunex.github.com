I've been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I've managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I've beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I've begun to appreciate them less. I
don't find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I'd rather just play the game itself. Since I don't plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.

It was fun C. Viper. I'll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P
