Today's plan is to try and kill the Long Gui and the Yomi. Killed
the Long Gui on the second try with 2 staggers and 5 stars. Beat
Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the "last time on
FF13-2", it shows Lightning saying "It's up to you to keep hope
alive". It was "It's up to you to keep Hope alive", then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn't on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl
