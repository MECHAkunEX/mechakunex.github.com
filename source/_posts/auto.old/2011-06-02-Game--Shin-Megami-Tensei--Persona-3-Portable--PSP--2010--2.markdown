I played Persona 3 again. This time I played a female character
named Buffy Summers. That was the best part. I maxed all the
social links with a walkthrough and got all the remaining Personas
(there were five more I needed.) I just played 30 minutes a day
and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies
except bosses, because my MC was soooo powerful. Overall, it
wasn't as good as the first time. I can't tell if it is because
I'd done it before, or because being a girl wasn't as exciting. I
can't really get excited about wooing boys. :) There are
definitely some good jokes if you know what happens to the guy.
