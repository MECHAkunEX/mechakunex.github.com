After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).

This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options---choosing different characters---is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)

I can't believe this wasn't originally a Mario game and wasn't
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.

I also use Peach by the way, she's the best.
