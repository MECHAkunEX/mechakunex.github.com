Played Episode 41 Level 4 for almost an hour. Sometimes when I
play this game, I think to myself, "Wow, I hate this game's
controls so much." It is so frustrating that they never seem to
work right. Super Meat Boy has almost ruined every other
platformer for me. In fact, I'm so mad at the game right now, I am
demoting it from every two days to once a week.
