This episode was mostly about the character of Starbuck and her
demons. I don't like her very much, so I wasn't enthralled with
the episode, but I thought it was a little neat to learn about
the training regime. I'm glad that the pressure from the Cylons
is back on. I didn't like how they try to make her a kind of
"sexual" character, because I think she's really weird looking
and it doesn't work very well.
