The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there's
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different... a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control... like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you'll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I'm glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can't tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03
