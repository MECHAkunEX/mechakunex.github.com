The Wild artifact thing is confusing, I was under the impression
it was a one time use to open the gate, but now I understand it is
just a different kind of gate. It's cool that in the frozen Bresha
Ruins, the character textures are different (covered in snow)!
This is the first time I've been back to a place with different
layouts. Now I know how to get to places it seems like I can't
go. The Live Trigger against the Proto fal'Cie is
interesting... it seems that when you choose wrong you have to
fight him again as punishment. [018:07:35 Frags 28/160 Lvl 223]
