So I've beaten Xenosaga just the other day. It was a pretty good
game, although what was said about it being very much like a movie
is very true. Although it was certainly a good movie. perhaps one
of the annoying things about it as a game was that there was no
real need to utilize all your characters. After I had everyone I
just stuck with a particular grouping for the whole game.
