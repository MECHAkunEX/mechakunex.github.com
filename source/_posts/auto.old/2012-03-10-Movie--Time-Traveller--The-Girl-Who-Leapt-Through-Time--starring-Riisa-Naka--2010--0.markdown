This is an awesome version of this story. The relationship between
Akari and Ryota is very cute and chaste. The story is incredibly
sad, but in a meaningful and moving way... not cheap at all :) It's
great. The special effects are pretty terrible, but there's really
only one sequence, so it doesn't distract. Riisa is beautiful.
