I played up to 2-1, at which point I had to deal with the really
floaty downward motion of the character. It's really awkward to
control, but I think the game is real interesting. The idea of
turning enemies into bubbles so you can ride them and/or attack
other characters is very clever and would work in almost any other
platformer I think.
