I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.

I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.

However, other than number 9, I've never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.
