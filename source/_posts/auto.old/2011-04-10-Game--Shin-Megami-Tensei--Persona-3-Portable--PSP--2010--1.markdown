I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I'd never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.

I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn't
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)

I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven't played a game for so long in a while.

I really liked the way understanding your enemy's weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would've preferred.

I played as the Male main character. I'd like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I'd also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it's fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC "Buffy
Summers". =)

I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.

I *highly* recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.

* Male MC: Aeon 8 / Fortune 5 / Temper. 5 / Priestess 1
