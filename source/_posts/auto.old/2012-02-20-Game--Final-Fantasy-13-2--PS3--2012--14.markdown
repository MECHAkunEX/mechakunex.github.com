I didn't play today, but I did run the slot machines a bit. I went
from 12,556 to 16,526 in the morning, but never made anything
after that. I hate stuff like this in games, but honestly, I don't
think I really had other time to play the game anyways, so it
isn't really a big deal. [038:33:40 Frags 103/160 Lvl 419]
