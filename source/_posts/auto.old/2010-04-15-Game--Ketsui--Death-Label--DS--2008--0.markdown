Of the past two-ish months, I've played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It's kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.

It's a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It's quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don't get as many
lives/bombs during it.)

I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn't registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)

Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540

Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)
Extra =
