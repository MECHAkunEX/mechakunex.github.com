I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)

I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc'd the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the [shmups forum](http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=23025)
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.

So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.

Here's a YouTube link to some [videos of the game](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&search_type=&aq=0&oq=mushih). It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.

*Edit:* I played the next day and one life'd it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.
