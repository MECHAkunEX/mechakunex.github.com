As if the last episode/season finale did not end with enough bad
stuff going on, this one opens with almost every bad thing
imaginable all happening at the same time. Some of the bad things
seem a bit too contrived... like Starbuck losing the raider. But
overall it created a lot of tension that the rest of the season
can resolve.

I like the further development of the backstory for some of the
characters.

I was really struck by how the marine wanted to pray and he
called the president the Gods' prophet.

I was very annoyed that Lee didn't immediately go investigate the
fallen Cylon ship, although maybe the next episode will open with
him doing exactly that.
