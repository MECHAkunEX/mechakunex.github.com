Before starting the new season, we watched the collected short
videos they made as a preview. Alone, they were kind of "eh",
maybe the most important thing was the off-hand comment that the
Cylons said they were there to help. Of course, after the first
episode, there was more important, but it wasn't obvious at the
time.
