I watched this because I listened to Retronauts and they talked
about it. I remember seeing it when it first came out and I enjoyed
it---as far as random action movies are enjoyable. The second time
around I continued enjoying it on that level. The CG effects are
pretty poorly integrated, but other than that it is really an on
par movie. I don't mind that the movie doesn't directly reference
anything in the game, because I think that it definitely feels like
it could be in the same universe. I enjoy that about it... it is
not stuck with decisions of the games and can do its own thing. On
the other hand, I read the original script by George Romero and
that it was pretty awesome and would have made a much better,
awesome movie.
