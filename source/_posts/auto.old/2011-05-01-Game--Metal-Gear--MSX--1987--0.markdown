I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that
comes with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. I remember playing
Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young... it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don't remember doing very well at
it.

I played through this game on the new "Easy" setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:

Mission record:
Difficulty: Easy
Play time: 3:03:07
Save: 37
Continue: 23
Alert Mode: 122
Humans Killed: 292
Ration Used: 33
Special Item: Not used
Code Name: Deer    

I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.

I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.
