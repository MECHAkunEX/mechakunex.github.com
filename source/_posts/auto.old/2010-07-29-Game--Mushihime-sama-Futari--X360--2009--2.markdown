I've had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I'd comment on it more than my original post.

I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it's a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.

It's hard to express what I like about it. There's so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.

So far I've been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC

I'm now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I've been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I'll get better though.
