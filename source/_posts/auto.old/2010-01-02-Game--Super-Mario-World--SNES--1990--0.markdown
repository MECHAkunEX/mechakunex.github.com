I've recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn't come with this game,
so I didn't play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I've gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.

I beat this game. I didn't get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn't do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser's Castle.
