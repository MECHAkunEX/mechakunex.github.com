I loved this episode because I'm so fascinated by Baltar. I wish
he would get a break. He's really not terrible.

Before this episode, I was thinking about the show and how
sketchy their information about the past, and in particular,
Kobol, is. It doesn't make sense that if their ancestors could
travel through space, they also wouldn't keep detailed records
that would give much more information. It's inconsistent.
