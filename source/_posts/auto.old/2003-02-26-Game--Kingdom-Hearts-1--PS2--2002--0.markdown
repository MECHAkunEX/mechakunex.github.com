In Kingdom Hearts, I've just about finished the game. I got to the
"Final Rest" before the last boss and then I left and tried to tie
up some loose ends. So far I've gotten all the synthesis items
(and thus Sora's ultimate weapon) and now I'm working on beating
all the Coliseum cups alone & with a time limit. I kind of don't
want to finish the game because then I won't have anything to
play. Maybe I'll cave in, beat it, and go buy something---not sure
what though. I'm pretty happy I'm basically done and I started it
last week. :)
