I played this game in Arcade mode today (normally, I play it once
a month and I've been doing Ragnar's story) and got to the end. I
think I will try some of the other characters over the next little
bit, but I'll practically consider it mostly done. I like Street
Fighter much more given my experience with this game. The story is
super super Anime. The graphics are gorgeous. But, the systems are
not as appealing or intuitive to me, but I have more experience
with SF, so I like it better.
