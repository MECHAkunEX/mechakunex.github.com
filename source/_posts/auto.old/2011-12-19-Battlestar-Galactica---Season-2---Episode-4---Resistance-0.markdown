I thought this episode was very neat. There were some cool
revelations: more people on Caprica and how many Cylons were
left, in particular. I've decided that I think Gaius' goal is to
create a truce between the Humans and the Cylons. I've been
really annoyed with Tigh's behavior. Now I think things will get
back on track now that the Commander is back on his feet.
