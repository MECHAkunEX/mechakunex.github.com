the stuff I wanted to. I played through Floor 10 of Zhonecage two
more times and got the Darkened Ore and then I finished the Katz
Korner Inn Requests and fought the Gentleman. He was a bit of a
let down as the last boss I fought, because he was so easy. 

Before I closed out my save, I backed it up and then sold
everything to max out my stamps (although I wasn't able to get
all 10 everywhere.) I bought some pretty good stuff in the Grade
Shop for New Game+. Here were my stats for the game:

Asbel's Level: 113
Encounters: 2028
Max Combo: 278
Enemies Seen: 99.3%
Items Seen: 96.5%
Skits: 82.3%
Battle Time: 23:47
Grade: 3119

I think it is interesting that while I played for about 107 hours,
I was only in battle for about 24 of those, or about 22% of the
game time. My average battle length was 42 seconds, which is
interesting given that I had some pretty long battles too.

I immediately started a new game and played for an hour and a
half. I have been doing most of it on Chaos difficulty, but at
this point where I can't bring people back to life, it is very
difficult with the 10x damage and 2x critical, so I dropped it to
Evil for a bit. After an hour a half, I got to Level 28 and am
just before getting Richard back as adults... which is crazy. I'm
obviously skipping every scene, I know exactly where to go, and I
have 2x movement speed.

Game 2: 1:26 @ 20:42 - Level 28
10x damage is /really/ hard on Chaos and pretty hard on Evil

Game 1:     107:34
Game 2:       1:26

I completed Zhonecage and did almost all the Inn requests by
grinding shards in Zhonecage. The only things left are to do that
last Katz Korner requests, fight the Gentlemen, then fight Lambda
Theos. I checked and my grade is now 2907. I just need a little
bit more so I can get the best carry-overs. Some carry-overs don't
seem very useful, such as half of my money or the battle items,
because with so much more gald per battle, I don't think I'll
really need it. Plus I only have about 300k in the bank because of
dualizing. (Although perhaps the best thing to do is sell
everything before you New Game+?)

In the evening I played for another hour and a half-ish. I beat
Lambda Theos and got a few more of the Katz requests. I tried
Zhonecage 10 again so I could get the Darkened Ore and didn't get
it. Very frustrating. I'm nearing the end.

I made some
more attempts to gather stuff in the process of dualizing for
floor 10. I decided to clear the game on the other difficulties. I
did Moderate and Evil. I haven't done the 60 seconds or the Chaos
difficulty though. I'm not confident I can. Also, I decided to
check my grade: 2719. I can get basically everything except
Skills and x3 SP.

In the afternoon, I played for about an hour and decided to try
and farm shards in Zhonecage for the kinds of shards I needed for
the inn requests. This was very successful.


In the evening, I continued that for about an hour.  I think there
are only two or three more requests I need to do. I also think
there's just one more upgrade before I can hit floor 10.

dualize Malik's final weapon (because I don't normally use him

Zhonecage levels (that I don't have the spheres from) until it is
worth enough.

Using that plan today, I got the spheres for everyone but Asbel
and got the Purebright Cloth. The amount of stuff I need from
Zhonecage is much smaller now... although I will need to fight the
Dark Turtlez more to get the Turtlez Togz. I was able to do Level
9, but its not enough to get to level 10. Painful.

I can't decide if I should do the rest of Riot Peak now or after
I do level 10.

is pretty exciting. I'll be working at getting the other ones. I
really dislike grinding for random items (in general), so I feel
like I might give up get 100% everything in this game because it
will be necessary to grind shards and these spheres to get
everything. That's so annoying. I really dislike it when games
make you play in a way that makes you hate them at the end. I'm
fine with random drops, but the chance should be high enough that
after beating the game, you should have a few of everything from
fighting them throughout the game.

I then made a list of all the various items I hadn't yet collected
so I could begin getting them. This required, among other things,
going back to World's Eye to get some more Legendary Metal, which
was very painful. But I tricked the game by Saving &amp; Loading to
get the Discovery to regenerate.

I took a break for a while and played again in the evening for an
hour and a half. I went to Zhonecage and beat levels 1, 2,
and 3. I accidentally set my difficulty to Easy a few times and
then Chaos for the others (but I should have just done Evil, since
I want the Spheres.) This means I've got to do those levels again
if I want them. Bummer.

For the first thing, I
beat Poisson, using basically the same technique as last time,
but she didn't get to use her Mystic Artes on me, so I won.

During the session there were a lot of cute skits. There was a
great one of Hubert complaining about how scandalous Richard's
final battle costume was; one where Cheria thought she was too fat
and broke the elevator because she had a sweet potato; one where
Lambda tells Pascal to figure something out herself and then ruins
her discovery by revealing it at the last moment. It's great
stuff. :) An odd thing I noticed today in a lot of the scenes was
that Lords, Kings, Leaders, etc all have lots of paperwork to do
and it defines their life. I think game was made in Japan. :)

I did the final dungeon and final battle. The very last area was
very beautiful and the last battle was pretty insane. I loved the
whole counter thing, although I'm not sure how you'd know to do
it.

The ending is nice. I think Sophie's new getup looks
awesome... too bad it doesn't unlock a title so you can have her
like that all the time. I also thought the resolution of the
various romances was sweet.

I loaded up New Game+ to see what my grade was: 1774. I think I
can do a little bit more dualizing, plus some of the EX Dungeon
to get it higher. I intend to do that. Unfortunately, I missed
some skits and side-quests early on, so I can't possibly get
those 100%. Grr.

I like the resolution of the Asbel/Sophie plot and I'm glad it's
not romantic. It's pretty adorable though.

Later in the morning I played for about two hours and got through
the confusing garden and fought the Little Queen. What a strange
character.

--

In the evening I played for about two hours and went through the
post-Little Queen sequence. I liked going around having Lambda
talk to everyone. The voice actor sounds like someone from Metal
Gear, but I can't place who.

I loved the skit with Pascal singing. It was so ridiculous.

I tried to do the Master Class Riot Peak trial, but died at
Poisson at the end... when she was almost dead and she was doing a
Mystic Arts. I'm not sure if I got the prizes, because there was
no mention of anything afterwards, unlike usual. I think I will
try again and go into Accel mode when she has a break.

of little breaks. I basically just did the last dungeon, but I
popped out once to do a few more requests and side quests.

I found it really interesting during the final moments of the game
to learn more about Lambda and how he was created and lived.

The side quest with the sick girl and the dolls was very cute and
had a nice twist in its ending. I also liked how one of the dolls
was the Prince from Katamari.

Two of my favourite skits so far were: when Asbel asks Pascal how
she got from the Amarcian Enclave to where the group was. Her
explanation was ridiculous. The other was when Pascal says that
Cheria is "chubbing out" and then her reaction to that comment.

I picked a fun set of costumes for my characters by the end of the
game: Sophie's pirate outfit, Cheria's new dress, Pascal's
swimsuit, Asbel's black outfit, and the two 'modern' outfits for
Malik and Hubert. I think they're all the best ones.

The last boss was very hard. I tried first on Chaos and got him to
half his health before running out of Elixirs and being
decimated. I next tried Evil and almost won but it was pretty
rough, so I decided when I tried again I'd do Hard. I did it that
time and got the Hard trophy (but not the Moderate
one... annoying.) A key I discovered was using the Hourglass
after his Mystic Artes had killed so many characters.

The ending was pretty intense and had a surprising resolution.

--

All together, it took my 68 hours and 18 minutes to get to the
"end" of the game. Of course, there's the Lineage &amp; Legacies
expansion, so I'm doing that too and will consider that to be the
actual end of the game.

It's pretty cool so far. My favourite skits have been the ones
about marriage. It's so cute that all of Asbel's proposals remind
him of Cheria and Cheria's crazy dream about their wedding day.

I don't yet understand the Accel system and I'm surprised that any
of the other characters would be able to use it given the story
explanation for its existence.

the Master Class Riot Peak Trial, but died at the last boss

all the other characters for the first time. I was pretty
surprised at how differently they all played.

quests and satisfying requests. I'm now going down the list of
discoveries to make sure I have the ones I can before I move on to
the story. I think I can't really be near the end because there's
a lot of stuff I don't have the ability to do yet. I think it is

them through the mixer or playing again (I presume?)

I was thinking today about how the explanation of why Sophie

seems crazy, but I think the explanation is suitably interesting.
