  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There&#8217;s so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It&#8217;s like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I&#8217;m a masochist and can&#8217;t resist. I&#8217;ll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished the game tonight in about an hour. I did the Miasma
Cave, the last Arena season, and the fight against Therius. It was
a very sweet ending. Overall, I think this is one of the strongest
stories out of an RPG I&#8217;ve played. The ending is a little bit
tropey, but not incredibly and it really justifies the things that
are tropes. I was really affected by the relationship between Zael
and Calista. It felt as real as a movie. I really loved this
game. The combat system was really fun and challenging. I think
the next time I play I&#8217;ll try not to get too powerful so the game
is a bit more challenging&#8230; but it was still good
anyways. Mistwalker keeps getting better and better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard of this game online as a weird Japanese rail-shooter. I
like rail-shooters, but I find the zombie aesthetic to be pretty
boring. I thought it would be cute to have the girls/Cupid/love
thing going on in the game. I wasn&#8217;t let down in that regard, but
I found the gameplay to be very easy. I was able to clear one of
the girls in a very short period of time. I only had a hard time
with the &#8220;boss fights&#8221; because they all had different mechanics. I
really didn&#8217;t get what was going on with the book shelf
situation. I got a pretty good score on my first run, it said I
got 82% of the maximum or something and I got the &#8220;Good End&#8221;. But
it wasn&#8217;t really the sort of thing with a lot of interesting depth
to it&#8230; like Sin &amp; Punishment. This is kind of disappointing, but
I didn&#8217;t pay too much for the game.</p>

<p>I was slightly nervous that the game would be too scandalous but
it&#8217;s not bad at all. The girls are all normal anime girls and
there&#8217;s no cleavage or anything like that at all. The most racy it
gets is that the girl&#8217;s skirts rustle and sometimes it flash their
underwear for a moment. I was pleased that the girls in swimsuits
were wearing sports one-pieces, like they were properly on a swim
team.</p>

<p>I think my favourite part of the game were the animations and
sounds&#8230; particularly how when the girls get close, they give
the character an invitation or if they &#8220;attack&#8221; from far away
they shout something like &#8220;Love&#8221; or &#8220;Really Like You&#8221; and the
words are coming at you.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a totally bizarre game, but not very deep. I&#8217;m not sure how
its depth compares to something like Resident Evil: Umbrella
Chronicles, which is structurally identical but with a zombie
skin. But, Gal*Gun isn&#8217;t interesting enough for me to want to
play more than a few times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I played for about an hour. I was surprised at how
quickly the new Jirall plot line was resolved. I was also very
sad that Calista was kidnapped. The game does a really good job
of making you feel really connected to and protective of
her. During the Jirall fight, I realized that I hadn&#8217;t seen
Dagran in a long time&#8230; where is he?</p>

<p>After we got home from the day, I played again, all night (about
four hours, with some breaks for snacks, etc.) I basically beat
the game and got to the epilogue. The final sequences had some
really tough fights. I fought the final boss three times before
winning. The final reveal of the big bad was pretty intense. I
really liked the epilogue sequence with Calista&#8217;s parents. It
seemed so appropriate for the couple to go on a little adventure
together before getting married. It&#8217;s adorable. Calista&#8217;s dress
was great too. I wish you could have her wear it during normal
gameplay. I feel like there&#8217;s still a lot of stuff to do in the
game&#8230; people to talk to, weapons to continue upgrading,
etc. It&#8217;s very strange. It&#8217;s like the final sequence of Earthbound
or Dragon Warrior but amped to the max because there&#8217;s so much to
do. It&#8217;s exciting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took my son to the theatre to see this today. He really enjoyed
it. I thought there were definitely some funny parts too, although
overall the plot is incredibly weak. It&#8217;s very short and a kid&#8217;s
movie, so that&#8217;s understandable. In terms of plot, it&#8217;s basically
the same as an episode of a cartoon, but with longer scenes and big
events. I thought the finale of the Scrat subplot was awesome
though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I advanced the story quite a bit. I feel like I&#8217;m in the closing
stages: I&#8217;m going to fight Zangurak, then send the Outsider back,
and live happily ever after with Calista. I thought her wedding
dress was very cute and I liked the resolution of the wedding
plot. In the game play, there&#8217;s been a bit of a boss rush of sorts
where boss encounters similar to ones from earlier in the game
keep coming back. It&#8217;s fun though. The fight next to the Outside
was pretty exciting and difficult. That whole sequence going down
the tunnel was very difficult&#8212;I think I died three times.</p>

<p>I accidentally used the Auto-Equip feature and all my outfits
changed. It was very painful to go back to dressing all the girls
how I like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my son wanted to play this real bad rather than Mega Man X
(which we&#8217;ve been playing for a while.) So we did it. We played
through the whole game. I got stuck pretty bad on the Wily
Machine, but other than that I walked through the game pretty
easily. I happened to choose a really nice order for the levels
so I had a lot of good items and weapons during the levels. It
was really fun to go through the whole game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a short amount of time yesterday before going to
bed. I mainly just advanced the story. It turns out that Lavos is
behind Zael&#8217;s power and the destruction of the world. Bummer. I&#8217;m
excited about a cute wedding scene.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played for a lot. A new arena season was opened, so I
had a lot of fun playing it over and over so I could max out all
my currently available items, etc. I did it like seven times. In
addition to that, I did some story missions, including the
haunted mansion. The best part of that was Horace&#8217;s ridiculous
comment about his wife afterwards. The stealth section escaping
from the castle was kind of odd, but worked as much as it needed
to. It was much better with Callista than with Zael alone. I&#8217;m
weirded out by Dagran being a sketch ball. I wonder where the
story is going. I presume that the Count is really the big bad in
some way, but maybe also I&#8217;ll fight &#8220;The Outsider&#8221;.</p>
