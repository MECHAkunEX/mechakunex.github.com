It's is practically without
dialogue for huge stretches and its setting is virtually without
compare. It feels incredibly realistic, although I don't really
have any way to verify that. I'm kind of amazed that it was made.

I think the most crazy part was when the lady is nearly drowning in
the pit and happens to give birth because the fall "shocked" her
into it. It was a little bit too crazy, but it worked in the story.

The movie was far more gory than it needed to be, but I think I
understand why Gibson designed it that way.

It's cool that at the core it is a "chase" movie.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2006/">2006</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/01/16/Movie--The-Grey--starring-Liam-Neeson--2012--0.html">Movie: The Grey, starring Liam Neeson (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/01/">01</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/01/16/">16</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a very stirring movie. Neeson's character is so tough and
it's so tragic how some of the guys die. The final moments are
really powerful: man's determination to live at all costs and
despite everything. Even though I am a very faithful man, I'm glad
that they didn't have a cliche scene that would save Ottway and
give him faith in God. I think it is better that he did it himself.

The movie had way too much swearing, but I think the characters
would have acted liked that, so it reflects real-life in that
sense.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/01/15/Movie--The-Raid--Redemption--starring-Iko-Uwais--2011--0.html">Movie: The Raid: Redemption, starring Iko Uwais (2011)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/01/">01</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/01/15/">15</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was an intense movie.

how the Time Travel concept is really just something to tell a

A great line: "I'm going to France." "You should go to China." "I'm

I got to the Amarcian
Enclave and verified my hypothesis that Pascal is really an
Amarcian and that there are few left. When we got there, it was
interesting that one of the people said that we were people from
"the world below"---meaning they are in the sky. I had previously
assumed that they were underground. I wonder if the weird ring you
sometimes see in the sky is one of their creations or something?

There were some funny moments today in the skits. I enjoyed one
where Sophie said her favourite food was Crablettes (Crab
Omelettes) and Malik couldn't get a word in edgewise about the
food he liked. There was another where Hubert said that Cheria
was dressed indecently and he couldn't believe how much of her
thigh was revealed in combat. It was very funny to have two react
to that situation. :)

Gameplay-wise, I unlocked the Chaos difficulty. It is incredibly
hard. Almost every random battle can take me out. I think I
should camp on Mt. Zhavert for a bit and get up some
levels. There was a time when I had to beat one enemy at a time
and then run back to the Save Point because I was so nervous
about dying and losing progress. (I died maybe... six times in
that area.) When I fought the Boar boss at the end, I did pretty
well on Chaos, but ultimately dropped it to Evil to do it.

I did the whole first set of the Shot Cube puzzle game. It's
pretty fun.

I'm really enjoying all of Pascal's crazy dialogue; she's
actually funny. There was also a great skit with Sophie where she
thought she recognized peaches: once everyone was excited, she
said they reminded her of little butts. ;)

I've decided to go back through earlier parts of the game and
write down all my pending requests so I can keep an eye on them.

Along the way, I decided to complete the Arena---although I did
it only Easy. The last boss was really tough.

Stage 46 --- This level was super tough to get the various pieces

through were the worst, then the Longai-O at the end was pretty
tough.

Stage 47 --- This level took a few tries to get to the end, but
now I can get to the end without even thinking. It's so
frustrating and unfair though, because I spend about three
minutes getting a chance at the final boss... who kills me in 5

across the strange discussion of /The Invitation/, a 1960 ballet by
the Royal Ballet Touring Company that featured a re-enacted rape
scene on stage. There's a footnote about how ballet was technically
not under the purview of the censors. As an example:

"In August 1960, representatives from the Lord Chamberlin's
office attended a performance of /Les Ballets Africains/ to
determine if the production was ballet or theatre. If ballet,
bare breasts were permissible; if theatre, strictly
forbidden. The authorities agreed it was a ballet---and the
press had a field day with photos." (pg. 433)

beat it the first time I got to the Longai-O today. It was very
scary and I had to get up and walk around to get my heart to stop
racing.

Stage 44 --- I got to the end of this level on my first try today
and had just a few more hits needed on the Big Bot before it
died, but I wasn't quick enough staying behind its back and it
got me. I think I should have stopped, froze it, and hit it with
a Counter. I'll do that when I play again today.

Later in the day I played for another forty-ish minutes.

Stage 44 --- I beat this after a few more tries. The first time I
got to the Big Bot I got him, but it took a while to get there
because I was a bit sloppy.

Stage 45 --- This level took a long time to do. Eventually I
settled on a single Dash to double Freeze to Counter attack. It

Part of me feels like the game requires you to understand
something about golf... because it doesn't give you any assistance
understanding what will happen because of the wind, ground
curvature, or grass length, etc---but requires you to figure it
out. I don't find that my intuition for that stuff is growing.

Nevertheless, I definitely have fond memories of playing the game
