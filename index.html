level. It felt pretty competent and I liked how fast the game was,
but it was pretty uninteresting from a challenge perspective. I
found Acts 3 and 5 to be the most challenging, but Act 3 was
mainly painful because the collision detection on the platforming
was so strange. Act 5 was bad because there were unavoidable shots
from the sky that gave you a push-back on your jump, so it got in
the way of doing trivial platforming.

enjoy.

In many ways the game is reminiscent of Mega Man, except you don't
gain abilities from bosses and the power-ups aren't useful
(they're like Castlevania power-ups in that they give you the
ability to shoot in different directions) and the consequences for
getting hurt seem much much higher. Apparently Darkwing's pain
threshold just isn't very high.

Every screen was a huge battle that wore me down. I decided to
leave it at that. I now know that this game is pretty solid, but
not better than Mega Man. The main distinctive thing about is the
large number of jumping/hanging platform sequences, which we
pretty neat.

sitting atop a giant crab, which I was not able to do after quite
a few continues. I found that in the three boss battles I had,
the enemies took absurd amounts of damage. I got passed the first
one by using each of the characters in a sequence, using up all
their energy before going to the next one.

I feel like this game is really tight and nice for its age. I
don't have any connection to it and some things about it are very
frustrating and unsatisfying. I think I will put it back on the
queue as a "revisit later" game. The multiple characters are
definitely interesting, although it is a bit much to manage all
their energy gauges and then make sure you deliberately switch
away from one as it is about to die. Definitely a really
intriguing game, but not something I fell in love with right away.

This felt like a solid, average, platform-action game with melee
combat. The only interesting things were the power-up system
based on three-letter strings of A and B, but all the power-ups
felt pretty useless so it wasn't worth learning which I should be
building up to. The other interesting thing was the way you had
to spend money on upgrades during the levels, but it was a bit
annoying because you didn't keep them from screen transition to
screen transition.

The two bosses I fought were really easy. I played each twice and
beat it without getting hit a single time on the second try,
because the pattern was so clear.

I can imagine having spent a lot of time on this game in an era
when there was nothing else to do, because it feels pretty
solid. But, today it doesn't feel strong enough to be worth an
investment.

I'm finding this game has a higher percentage of the kinds of Lolo
puzzles I don't like. I don't like when a puzzle requires a lot of
execution skill, because the controls in these games are so
awkward. I also don't like it when you have to use "holes" and
riding on eggs in water, because you can't really predict where
they will go, so it seems unfair because you can't plan your
solution totally before doing it. Nevertheless, I'm still having
fun.
