I beat
Tritoch, got Strago, explored a bit, and tried to get Umaro. I
kept getting creamed over and over by lots of different enemies. I
feel like so many things about this mod are brilliant, but the
WoR, in particular, has been made too hard. It used to be that you
had a lot of options of what you wanted to do at this point, but
I'm finding that either there's a certain order you should go in
or the thing to do is grind a lot. I'm quite annoyed. I don't
think I'll play anymore, unless I just want to do some
time-wasting grinding. It's a bummer, because so much about the
mod is awesome.

I feel like Jon was
awesome and Dany was less than great, but it was great when she
apologized. It was especially good for Tyrion and Jon to catch
up. It was very provocative what Melissandre said! It was awesome
when the dragons flew by!

I think that Yara's men won't care about Theon and probably won't
care about Dany... at best they will want revenge but that
doesn't seem to motivate the Ironborn much.

Euron is so gross, but in a hilarious way. Cersei's way of
dealing with the Martells was so brutal. I was surprised to see
the Iron Bank come, but it was cool.

Sansa was doing a great job and I'm impressed by how good
Littlefinger's advice was. It was awesome to have Bran back and
interesting that he immediately answered the question on my mind,
that he should be the Lord of Winterfell. I'm a bit disappointed
he didn't do anything more and that we didn't see Meera in a new
outfit like we saw Bran.

It's sad that Sam and Jorah didn't talk about the White Walkers,
because when Jorah goes back to Dany it would be useful for him
to support Jon.

The Unsullied, and by extension Dany, are doing really
terribly. The Tyrell's situation made it so much worse. It's sad
how badly Dany is being trounced when it comes to strategy. She's
been so dominant and confident, so she can't deal with a good
threat.

Jaime and Olenna's conversation was great.

I've decided that it would be a bad idea for Arya to travel
north, because all she'll do is talk to her family and then
immediately have to travel all the way back south. She's the best
weapon of the Starks against Cersei, when they will otherwise be
facing the White Walkers. I suppose she could be a good support
against Littlefinger when he inevitably betrays them.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/07/30/Game--Final-Fantasy-6--Brave-New-World--FF6-rom-hack---SNES--2013--11.html">Game: Final Fantasy 6: Brave New World (FF6 rom hack) (SNES, 2013) (12)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/07/30/">30</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for a bit and got Relm then Cyan.

This review is great: ``In his review, Ollie Barder stated, "In
many ways, this new movie is a searing indictment of how the 2011
Tohoku earthquake and tsunami as well as the Fukushima disaster
were mishandled by the Japanese administration." He also noted the
film's depiction of the Japanese government, stating, "In that, the
old guard with their overly complex and corpulent bureaucratic ways
were simply unable to deal with a crisis in any kind of efficient
or fluid way. This is shown repeatedly in Resurgence, as the
high-ranking members of the cabinet, comfortable in their positions
of power, use the hierarchical nature of the system they reside
within to protect their own positions, at the expense of the lives
of their citizens."''</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2016/">2016</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/07/29/Game--Final-Fantasy-6--Brave-New-World--FF6-rom-hack---SNES--2013--10.html">Game: Final Fantasy 6: Brave New World (FF6 rom hack) (SNES, 2013) (11)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/07/29/">29</a></span></span><pre class="content">I went and got Terra.

inscrutable or don't work. The biggest thing is that company is
obviously evil and no one ever seems to notice or care, at least
any of the main characters.

For example, it is very unclear what is going on with Annie. Given
her outburst at the big meeting Mae goes to and how stressed out
she is about Mae being transparent, you think that maybe she is
opposed to The Circle, but it turns out that we were meant to just
see her as stressed out from work (this is confirmed by looking at
a book synopsis.)

Another example is the weird ending, Mae clearly "takes down" the
current leaders of the company, but then seems to be still all in
for the transparent world-view, which suggests that she is somehow
in charge or more influential or something. The book seems much
more disturbing on how she thinks.

This quote from Mick LaSalle is great, "What makes The Circle so
valuable is not only that it’s showing us a ghastly possible path
that the world may take, but that it articulates the mentality that
could create and sustain it." The idea that rather than being a
morality play, the characters believe what they're saying, but we
aren't supposed to, is a nice way to look at this messed up world.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2017/">2017</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/07/29/Movie--17-Miracles--starring-Jasen-Wade--2011--0.html">Movie: 17 Miracles, starring Jasen Wade (2011)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/07/29/">29</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a touching movie.
