I've heard Tim Rogers,
whom I adore, talk about how great it is. I played Alundra and
remember it fondly.

But... man, was I let down!

I find it totally impossible to control. It makes no sense. In the
opening sequence, I was standing on top of a platform and when I
pressed Up it did the same thing as pressing Right (and similarly
with Left and Down.) How was I supposed to get the Treasure Chest
unless I do more than just go on one particular track? It was
infuriating. It seems like the only way to move is press two
buttons at the same time, but it was almost impossible to move
this way with any finesse and predict where you will end up.

I just imagined having to go through difficult platforming
sequences like they show in the opening and it was enough to
totally turn me away. Ick! I can't believe something like this
could ever exist!

Also, it was really weird to get two life stocks before even
getting in one fight. What's the point of starting with 4 if you
immediately get 6 without needing to do anything?

I can imagine that someone might like this game, but I can't see
how.

earlier shooters. 

I think the problem is that these old games, through their
power-up systems, basically fool you into thinking you have
multiple lives, but you really don't because you just can't
survive the later stages without max power. This is disappointing
compared to something like Ikaruga where you have same power the
entire game, and thus everything is based on your skill.

Zone 2, which is the fifth level. I cannot say I like this game,
but it is not horrific to control and work with, and it is very
important historically, so I am going to finish it, because I
think it deserves it.

I think it is kind of ridiculous that I was able to get through so
many stages so quickly. In most of the stages, you feel like you
just hold Right on the D-pad until you are hit out of nowhere by
an enemy or obstacle you'd never be able to see. It feels like the
height of "unfair difficulty" where the only way to succeed is by
trial-and-error. 

At least once you get hit, you aren't really damaged and can
pretty trivially get your Rings back and move on. But then, you
aren't going fast anymore and you can almost never actually make
the jumps you need to while standing, so you have to meander
backwards until you can get a long enough run. It just feels so
inelegant and ugly.

On the other hand, when you actually do need to go slow, like when
you are carefully going through some platforming over lava or in
water, it is very hard to make small movements because Sonic
generally moves very quickly. It's very frustrating.

I have a very hard time believing that this game is so beloved and
was ever seen as a contender against Mario. It makes me think that
Sega kids were just totally blind and stunted by having to live in
their impoverished state.

Mario, and the Halloween one.

This is a very bizarre Mario game. It has enemies that are
uniquely occurring and behave very differently from other Mario
games. The collision detection is very strange... for instance,
some of the backgrounds have 3D effects and this causes it to look
like you are walking on a totally sheer or missing surface because
the visual is much smaller than the hit-box for it. This is
particularly painful with the huge bosses.

The continue system is strange. I had to continue a few times and
was very annoyed to see my coins go away, but I could tell what
was going on: you get to start up again with all the levels beat,
but you have to go back for the coins. Basically, that means that
to beat the game, you can beat every level individually, but you
have to come back and do six levels (with boss fights) to finish.

It's strange because if the game were purely linear, like the
first Mario, I don't think I would mind very much. But, because
the game is so large and non-linear, I feel like progress is being
stolen from me.

In any case, this game has the classic problem for me of being an
ancient, awkward Gameboy game where so much is atrocious and the
stuff that is good, in this case the game-play, feels like it has
to make sacrifices because of the small screen real estate. Thus,
another game that I can recognize the goodness in, but can't bring
myself to dedicate to playing. I like that I was able to beat
about half of it though.

dungeon. 

Like its prequel, Neutopia 2 seemed perfect to me as a kid: a more
beautiful version of Zelda on an exotic Japanese console! What
could be better?

After playing it for a while, I found it a very sub-par copy of
Zelda. There are lots of little things that made it that way:

* One of the important things to me about Zelda is that power-ups
are not just "keys" but are generally useful throughout the
dungeons for lots of little purposes. In contrast, the first
power-up you get in this game is new Armor and you get the
impression that new Armor and Weapons will be a recurring
power-up. I think that power-ups like this are the laziest
because they replace a more interesting difficulty curve and
challenge with a ratcheting up of numbers alone.

* An essential piece of the Zelda meta-game is preserving your
health until you fight the boss deep in the dungeon after an
unsuccessful run. The "puzzles" in Zelda whereby you must
destroy all the enemies in a room before you can push forward
necessitates engaging with most enemies, and thus risking
damage. I found that in the first dungeon of this game I could
generally casually walk past enemies without much fear of
danger.

* A key piece of a good game is that it teaches you how to win and
rewards you for learning a "useful" skill. A classic example is
a boss fight where the boss moves relatively predictably and you
must learn their moves and exploit them. It is essential that
the boss actually give you clues to their moves, however. The
Sand Worm boss in the first dungeon of Neutopia 2, which is a
knock-off a similar Zelda boss, doesn't give such cues. It
appears randomly and selects a random spot to land in, often
going so high in the air and with such erratic curves that it is
impossible to track and anticipate. This feels un-fair and not
fun.

* Finally, a much smaller issue, I feel like the "upgrade" to
Zelda wherein you can walk on almost any pixels but it is very
easy to get mis-aligned with the enemy and very difficult to
hit.

Nevertheless, I wouldn't say the game is horrible, but it clearly
is not in the "canon" that I am trying to discover, so after
giving it its due (by beating the first level), I abandoned it.

It is interesting how clearly it is a sequel to Shining in the

different game-play.

Even though the attack options are pretty small, even in the first
three battles I felt like there was a lot of strategy to be had in
planning what I would do. However, it was excruciating to wait for
enemies to do nothing and a lot of the interface was much too slow
for my patience.

The extent to which this is a knock-off of Zelda cannot be
overstated. It is very clearly intended to be the same. I feel
like the SMS colors are a bit brighter and nicer, but with less
variety overall. The main character looks like Rocket Knight, and
kind of weird to me.

In terms of game play, it's fine, but not very special. I found
that the movement was a lot smoother than in Zelda, but that this
was a little problematic because it felt like you "slid" up to
enemies and couldn't stop in front of them. The first boss fight
wasn't very tough and it was much easier in general than Zelda
because the enemies didn't seem to respawn when you died and
continued.

Under the philosophy of only playing amazing games, I decided not
to continue, although I can appreciate that it seems like a
perfectly passable game.

today. For instance, I love that all veggies do damage to you and
how off kilter the enemies are: like the Opera lady or the band of
chickens. The people who help you, like Santa and the Carrot guy,
are so funny too.

Overall, I find the gameplay to pretty boring though. It
definitely is low key and lets you "chill" while playing, but it
also lacks any real excitement. Nevertheless, it is very cool that
it is a roguelike: random maps, random treasures, hunger,
etc. Bizarre.

door but couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do to get
through. I found the game to be way too sluggish and boring to be
worth playing. I think what I disliked the most was that it felt
like the combat was very slowly and you couldn't only do one
thing... duck and tap attack until they died. Very painful.

missions. I'm still learning how to combo effectively and it feels
good to be learning. I just unlocked the Angel Glide and have been
having a good time crawling the levels for hidden things.

Later in the day I played for about three more hours and got to
the end of the first tower mission. The combat continues to be fun
and I feel like I'm combo-ing better than before. I like all the
dorky one-liners and come-backs that Dante has. The fists are very
fun. I got to the first Secret Mission I couldn't complete... the
one where you have to be in certain rings to hurt the enemies.
