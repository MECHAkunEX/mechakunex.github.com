in his tail, or if he just doesn't like it being touched.

did it, because I had his pattern down really well and didn't even
use half my Blood Vials. It was cool!

I went with a Military Veteran
with the Pistol and the Axe.

It took me a long time to get used to the combat. The first area
of the street is really brutal with all the different enemies
wandering around. I walked slowly and was grabbed by the Wolves. I
went back (by sprinting) and got my Blood Echoes, then ran back
and went through the Kennels until I unlocked the shortcut. (I
love, by the way, that enemies take your Blood Echoes if they are
hunters. At first I didn't get it and was annoyed, but then I
realized it was great.) 

I tried to fight the Cleric Beast a few times, but failed and gave
up. I lost 6k souls from that, which hurt, but it was annoying
because I couldn't do anything with them anyways, since the fight
is what got me access to upgrading my level.

The game is pretty great. I was so nervous walking around with a
ton of Blood Echoes and not knowing the area. My wife came by and
I said, "My heart is pounding! This game is terrifying!"

I finished the
campaign and decided to put the game down. I did not get 100%
though. Here are the things that I had left to do:

- 2 Shangri-La missions: I probably would have done them had they
been available during the first part of the game, but I felt I
had been playing too long when I got to the North and I didn't
really love the unique combat there. It was often very
"frontal", as opposed to my preferred way of steal thing when
fighting in the normal game.

- 2 Longinus missions: I never really liked the Himalayas
missions, for the same reason as the Shangri-La, but the blood
diamond ones were fun.

- 1 skill: I never did the Arena, so I never unlocked its skill
and upgraded it, although by the time I ended the game, I had 10
Skill points waiting to be assigned. I basically never used the
Syringes anyways.

- 5 weapons: There were 5 weapons that I never got, some related
to the things mentioned above. Since I didn't really have any
more missions to do, I wasn't stress about getting them just for
the sake of having them.

- Lots of quests: Given that I did one of each, and they were all
the same but in a different area, I wasn't crazy about doing
them all. I can see if I were younger and had more time than
games, I would definitely do them all.

- Lots of collectibles: I wasn't going to go and tear down every
poster, but I tore down all the ones I went near during the
normal course of things. I think I would have gotten more
collectibles had I flown in the Buzzer less.

I ended up with 67.15% completion and there were no interesting
trophies that were not collected. I sided with Amita the whole
time during the missions, although I felt near the end they were
both pretty dumb. I didn't kill anyone (Sabal or Pagan) and just
let them go. I think the character I played would have killed
Amita and taken over the country. I think the best thing for the
world of the game would have been to do the secret ending where
you just wait for Pagan to come back in the beginning.

I really enjoyed taking over the Outposts and Fortresses. That was
easily the funnest part of the game, because you had to scope them
out and decide how you were going to do it and it was pretty
free. The Propaganda Centers were similarly fun. I really enjoyed
the feeling of shooting a helicopter out of the sky and sniping
from an extreme distance without being detected.

Overall I was very satisfied with the game, but I can't imagine
playing another game like it any time soon, because I already feel
a bit burned out on what kind of activity it had me do.
