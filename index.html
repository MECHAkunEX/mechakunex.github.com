game. I got everything in the game and got to the ending. The
ending is so moving... I nearly cried as the intro music played
again as all the characters came back. The final moments are crazy
too because there is yet another "true enemy" reveal.

Despite fighting through the lunar underground pretty easily and
getting every item in the game /and/ having full health... I was
destroyed by Zeromus instantly after just about two rounds.

I really dislike it when a JRPG doesn't give you a reason to
grind. When I grind to gather money to get more items, that's
fine, because I'm earning the money and I get the levels at the
same time. When you have to get into random battles as you are
going through a maze and gathering treasure chests, it's
fine. But if I can make it to the boss and get all the items, I
should have grinded enough to do it.

I couldn't bring myself to grind to defeat Zeromus. I looked into
using a Game Genie code to move it along faster, but they didn't
work. So I'm calling it done.

Final Fantasy 2 is amazing.

they are pretty shallow generally. There are some little moments
of depth though... like with Rydia and the fire spell. I think it
is comical how many characters nobly sacrifice themselves for the

most of the towns so that they could be rebuilt with better
structures. That enabled me to get up two more levels so I would
hit the max level and have the strength to beat it.

The ending, as you go through each town again, is very cute and
the very last moment when they talk about how people don't worship
God after they become advanced is very interesting.

Overall, I found the game to fun, if messy for the reasons I
mentioned before. I think I can recommend the game, but I don't
think I would want to play it again.

Something funny I noticed right away is that Cecil looks like a
mouse on the overworld... in particular the guy from Rocket
Knight adventures. His shadow is like a little tail.

The intro music as you leave Baron is amazing and gave me
goosebumps. So cool!

Later in the day, I got up to the Octomamm. I found that fight to
be really easy. I had about half MP on everyone and just blasted
him away.

In some ways, this game is really similar to Actraiser: it fuses
two different gameplay sequences together in a way that barely
connects them. In this, there's a bland side-scrolling mode and
then the town modes where you can do mini-games and buy things. I
haven't found anything worth buying, because it's so easy to lose
things like armor and you can't buy weapons.

The style and setting of the game is really quirky and cute. It's
not just because "Hey, Japan!" It seems strange even for Japan,
with lots of weird creatures... like the octopus boss and the
weird pink masked guys.

I can't decide if I want to play it more. It's very adorable and
well known, but it isn't that good. I wonder if maybe there's
something great further in? If I look online, it looks like I'm a
little less than half-way through.

I played for another twenty-ish minutes and couldn't make it

The game is really strange. The sim part is very basic and takes
a lot more of your time. It's not totally trivial, because you
have to manage the enemies while you are building. The combat
part is also really basic and quite a bit awkward in the control
department---the sprites feel too big and clunky. The boss
battles are basically "stand and slog" while spamming magic. It's
a bit disappointing actually.

In general, the whole game is easy in a strange way, but also
very compelling. I am almost done with the island city, then I'll
have it's final combat stage, the next city (two combat stages),
and then presumably a boss fight/final stage. I think I'll be
able to beat it about another hour, so I'll finish it.

I
found it to be easier than past Mega Man games in general and /a
lot/ easier than Mega Man 5.

I think the "problem" was that the Rush Jet is so powerful for
cheesing through areas. Similarly, Beat is really useful for
avoiding enemies in platforming sequences. Putting these things
together eliminated a lot of the challenges. 

This would normally leave the bosses as the main attraction, but
unfortunately the majority of them could be killed by standing in
front of them and shooting. You rarely ran out of the weakness
weapon before they died.

One of the hardest parts was the first Wily stage where there was
a long vertical drop of spikes where sometimes you needed to take
a leap of faith and then use the Rush Jet to catch yourself just
before hitting the spikes. It was pretty intense and took a lot
of tries.

It was definitely a *fun* Mega Man game, but I wouldn't say it was
as good, because I didn't feel super awesome after beating it.

I got to the boss of the third
level and used one continue in the process. I found the game to
be really interesting... the variety of power-ups is pretty
absurd and the cuteness of the game is off the hook. I found the
mechanics to be passable, but not lovable. 

The biggest pain in the mechanics was that it was to easy to
accidentally take a puff and launch into the air rather than just
do a normal jump and then when you accidentally got a power-up, it
was hard to get rid of it. It felt like it really needed a SNES
controller to have a distinct button for some of these things, or
if you could fly by doing a double jump or something. Finally, it
felt like there was a lot of lag in the controls, which normally
didn't matter, but was pretty horrible on the boss fights.

I just ran through the majority of the stages and only had to
think during the boss fights. The boss fights were solved by
either getting the perfect power-up right before or memorizing
the sequence of actions.

This is one of those games that I can see the beauty of at the
time, but similar games have such better systems, that it isn't
worth getting into. It has definitely convinced me to try future
Kirby games though.

tactics. The only place where their guerrilla tactics aren't used

Star Man's stage was pretty vanilla. It was funny that space =
underwater in the Mega-Man-iverse. The last checkpoint was really
brutal. Once I died right at the boss door from a stupid jump.

Gravity Man's stage was fairly easy, but his boss fight was
insanely hard. I could barely get any hits in. You had to use the
Star attack and be really careful. I hate it when in Mega Man boss
fights you almost can't win unless you have the weakness weapon.

Gyro Man's level was a good difficulty. I found the spike elevator
to be challenging, because I thought you needed to wait and slide,
but then I realized you needed to plan an early jump as the
platform was coming at you. The boss fight was really easy with
the gravity hold.

Lately, since I've been playing so many different NES games and
most of them aren't that impressive, I've been thinking to myself
that maybe the NES isn't as amazing as I remember. But then I play
a game like this that is really amazing and I remember why I love
it so much. It's just a matter of finding the right games.

house. But, ultimately, for me today it doesn't have enough
appeal.

level. It's a ridiculous take on basketball---you are literally
fighting while "playing basketball" and then there are three hoops
are different heights. I didn't really understand what to do and
especially not how to get the ball to the higher baskets. I
basically just played "defense" by hurting all the enemies while
Riki got some baskets. It was a very frenetic and crazy game... I
can't really say I enjoyed it, because it felt so out of control,
but I feel like I could appreciate it a bit.

I had
tried it once before. It is really crazy and amazing that it is
an NES game. The technology, and the screen size in particular,
really make it hard to do a game like this well. I love shmups
and bullet hell ones in particular, but this game was at the
wrong time and place to really do it well, I think.

So... my verdict is: visually impressive for the time, but not
playable today.
