thirty minutes and couldn't beat it. As I mentioned yesterday, I
feel like this game doesn't give you the ability to dodge at all,
so with these one-on-one fights, it feels like there's no strategy
except "Duke-it-out". I really didn't enjoy it.

one. I played as Dante (no idea about what's the deal with other
character.) At first, the game feels a lot better. It moves faster
and the mechanics feel tighter. Just being able to clearly see
what enemy you are targeting and see their health bar go down
makes the game feel much nicer. However, the game felt like a
back-and-forth between boring and exploitable enemies and nigh
impossible challenges.

For instance, in Mission 5 there's a sequence with giant Tanks. If
you just slowly circle-strafe them then they can't hurt you at
all, but they soak up a TON of damage from your shotgun. Similarly
with the Chopper a bit later... it can't hit you if you just hang
out under it, but it takes a ton of hits. I finally had enough of
the game when I got to the next section where you have to climb up
a burning building with ridiculously awkward platforming controls.

I can definitely see how this game was the "true form" of what
they realized they wanted to do after making the first game, but
it still wasn't appealing enough for me.

I've
heard a lot about this from my love of Bayonetta.

In the first three missions, I found it to be a pretty bad
game. It definitely feels like it was originally a Resident Evil
game, with the fixed, stuffy camera angles and the awkward
"adventure game" tropes throughout the castle.

I don't find the combat to be very fluid and I feel like it's
impossible to dodge at all, which means there's almost no
"finesse" to combat. It reminds me of a traditional 2D brawler
where the key is not to dodge, but to evenly spread out your
attacks against a lot of enemies to keep from getting
surrounded. It's definitely a coherent design, but I can't say I
really enjoy it.

The boss battle in the third mission was ridiculous. It felt like
you couldn't hit the thing at all. Eventually, I looked at a FAQ
and it said to dodge, but you can't really move quickly and then
whenever you try to move around the camera angle changes on you so
you turn around. It is infuriating. In the end, I just tried to
spam jump on its back over and over. I'm kind of amazed that I was
able to beat it the time that I did, because it didn't feel any
different on my part from before. I died maybe... 10 times and did
a few different reloads before I won. I felt like just quitting
and saying the game wasn't for me. But since I won, I guess I will
keep going. I'm not excited about it though.

I find the need to hold R1 to use the gun to be very annoying. I
can appreciate its unique "stick shift"-like quality, but it
doesn't feel beautiful or good to me.

dread the idea of playing three more times just to see more. I
wonder if I'll be able to easily find the differences on
YouTube... the game is definitely fun, but when I think of playing
it again, I just think of all the tedious parts that I will have
to do again and how I *know* that I will win all the
fights... since I've already done it.

--

Later, I started the new file and went through the Kaine dream
sequences that happen right away. It was neat. Then I just watched
the ending videos on YouTube. Since I played with the voices off
the whole time, it was really weird to hear the voices on the
videos.

After watching the videos and reading the NIER Wiki, I was
surprised at some of the details of the story. Some of it I
gathered from my play through, but it was much more clear
(obviously) reading and watching these things.

--

Overall, I thought this game was really cool. The battle system is
so traditional at first glance, but then becomes very unique as
you start getting into the "bullet hell" boss fights. Very cool.

I got
up to the part where you go to the military base. The game is so
weird. It feels like it came from another planet. The introduction
is so abrupt and a lot of the dialogue is incredibly bizarre. The
mechanics are really odd too. Obviously there's the weird fishing
game, which I totally failed at.

But, the most interesting thing to me is when a battle scene pulls
out to an almost 2D perspective and it feels like a bullet hell
shooter where you have to weave your way through geometric
patterns. The boss inside the military base was really cool in
that way.

The style of the game is exceedingly odd too. The main character
is so ugly. The girl Kaine is such a cliche, it feels like
pandering, but then the characters acknowledge that she's
pandering. It's weird. I was really annoyed that I just turned on
the game and within seconds heard almost every cuss word
around. I've been playing with the voice volume off, but haven't
actually heard anything bad.

I get the feeling that there's a huge amount of content I'm
missing by not being meticulous enough with the environments and
quests. I feel like every shop has stuff that appears useless and
is definitely too expensive to be worthwhile.

I am really annoyed at how far all the places I need to go between
are. It would be different if it were a normal RPG where you were
gaining power through the fights, but the progression in this game
seems incredibly slow. Not only are you gain levels very slowly,
but I feel like gaining a new level never matters.

It feels like the game defies you at every step and is just a
stumbling block. It's bizarre.

My final comment for the day... it is totally absurd that there
are two versions of this game in Japan and that the character
design is a Western cliche. I think the Japanese one looks a lot
better.

outfits, especially Naoto's since she never wore female clothes
before.

It's kind of amazing that it is exactly three months since I
started the game. I think that's too long to play the same game

the end.

I still need to watch the TV listings, but I won't count that as

It's amazing how often these movies are about duplicated, cloned,
and resurrected people.

The chase scene was very un-Star-Trek.

His name is "B-4". Hah.

The outfits of these guys are ridiculous.

Given how huge the ships look from space, I find it implausible
that people ever accidentally run into each other while walking
around. Furthermore, when they have big shoot outs in huge
hallways, you just wonder... why did they make that huge corridor
in the first place? It just seems like a big waste of resources.

The whole fast aging clone thing is clearly taken from Metal
Gear. :)

I'm continually amazed that Star Trek captains give their orders by
voice when things are happening so quickly. It seems like more
autonomous work would be more efficient.

All of the action sequences in this movie are lame.

It seems like the try to use self-destruct of the Enterprise in

fascinating. I thought it was bizarre that they said there were
just 600 people on the planet though. It seems like a waste of
planet. Prior to Picard's discussion with their leader, I thought
it was impossible that such a small population could exist with the
amount of culture they seemed to have. Afterwards, it seems
implausible that they would take such a small group to leave there.

I love what Riker says about Whorf's pimple: "Klingons never do
anything small, huh?"

This was a really cool movie, definitely one of the best.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1998/">1998</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/07/20/Movie--Warm-Bodies--starring-Nicholas-Hoult--2013--0.html">Movie: Warm Bodies, starring Nicholas Hoult (2013)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/07/20/">20</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was an amazing movie. When I first heard about the plot, I
assumed it would be stupid and they couldn't possibly earn its
premise. Yet, they did an amazing job right from the get-go. I
thought the allusions to Romeo &amp; Juliet were brilliant, as well as
subtle. It's exciting to think about a zombie movie from the
perspective of the zombies :)

I loved the part about the digital zombies in the past.
