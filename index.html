  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they&#8217;re texting, there&#8217;s
the six months she&#8217;s pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she&#8217;s actually dead, etc. It&#8217;s a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson&#8217;s girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he&#8217;d be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I&#8217;ll be very annoyed that there won&#8217;t be
any closure in the sixth episode.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about 20 minutes tonight. I used the X-RGB with the
Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can&#8217;t wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a cute movie with a pretty unique plot. The main girl was
cute and wholesome. I feel like the ending was a bit empty though,
because other than going to AA there was no explanation of how
Arthur changed. Th end of the movie suggested that Arthur&#8217;s only
problem was that he drank a lot (and perhaps having so many
resources exacerbated the impact of that), but didn&#8217;t deal at all
with his lack of knowledge, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the morning, we played for about a half hour and beat level 4&#8217;
via the secret route&#8212;beating Camilla&#8212;but not getting to 5&#8217;. I
started on stage 5 a bit, but was pretty beat down.</p>

<p>Later, I played for about an hour and a half and beat
stage 5. Eventually I was able to use the watch to get through up
to Death without getting hit at all&#8230; by pausing the action just
before the large green monsters. Sometimes this game seems totally
impossible and brutalizing. The key seems to always be using the
sub-weapons effectively and breaking the challenges. Or, learning
pitch perfect timing and getting through unscathed&#8230; but mostly
doing the sub-weapons just right. It&#8217;s a fascinating design.</p>

<p>After I mastered that, it took about 7 tries to kill Death. I
stuck with the Cross. I used an Item Crash early and pummeled
him. I dodged the huge skulls by staying to the left and
right. The melee fight was pure stick-and-move. It is so
satisfying to win at this game.</p>

<p>After Death was dead, I fought the Vampire Bat and was killed
Medusa in the Boss rush stage. I decided to go back and fight
Camilla again, because supposedly you need to beat Death to get
the secret exit&#8230; but no luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really fascinating episode. I liked how there were
some many subplots and little stories. I think the Moriarty
character is really cool, but I thought the actor wasn&#8217;t a good
choice. I expected someone older and more menacing
looking. Instead, this guy looks like an angry bully
kid. Hopefully as we see him more, he&#8217;ll look more the part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a neat episode, although I think the details of the
crime was not as interesting. Watching Sherlock be Sherlock was
very fun and I thought the introduction of the Sara character
was cute.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I played this game with my son for about an hour. We
beat level 2 the normal way after getting Maria. Now I have
unlocked up to 4 and 4&#8217;. We tried 4 but were totally brutalized by
the boss playing as Maria (she&#8217;s really weak.) We also rescued two
of the non-playable girls. Still&#8230; amazing game.</p>

<p>Later in the day we played for about thirty minutes and beat level
4&#8217; via the normal route and got to stage 5. I wish the game a
better way of tracking which levels/exits you have done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife has been wanting to watch a new show and this was
recommended to us by some people. We watched it tonight on
Netflix. It was really awesome. Basically every scene was
amazing, clever, funny, etc. It had it all. I love that everyone
assumes they&#8217;re a couple. It&#8217;s cute.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought a PC Engine and got this game. It is really fun to play
it again, especially without an emulator and save states, so I
have to do it better. Additionally, I&#8217;ve had a lot more
experience with the other early Castlevania games so I&#8217;m just
better at playing it. It&#8217;s really fun and smooth feeling, despite
having classic Casltevania stickiness.</p>

<p>I played only as Richter today and I did all secret exits. I went
from 0 to 1 to 2&#8217; to 3&#8217; to 4&#8217;. I fought the Serpent, the Minotaur,
the Werewolf, and the floaty head thing. It&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like &#8220;plays&#8221; but
should be like &#8220;paintings&#8221;, because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can&#8217;t express detailed, dynamic
stories&#8230; everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable&#8230; like a painting.</p>
