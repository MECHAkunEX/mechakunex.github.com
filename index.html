in an X-bow. I changed my settings so that the opponents were
weaker. The game is very fun and beautiful. I think I like not
having the license tests and just doing races. It's interesting
that they expose that you only doing a small percentage of the
real lap numbers and that you could do all of them if you
wanted. Similarly, I think it is neat that you do practice and
qualifying.

Roland's world and the problem with the rest of the series so far

interesting for him to react to. Just having four characters
sitting around a campfire over and over again gets boring because
their interactions are stale. On the other hand, exploring what's
going on in this small town is very fascinating.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1997/">1997</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/08/12/Movie--The-Notebook--starring-Ryan-Gosling--2004--0.html">Movie: The Notebook, starring Ryan Gosling (2004)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/08/">08</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/08/12/">12</a></span></span><pre class="content">This is a very cute movie.
