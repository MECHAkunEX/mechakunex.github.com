a bit uncomfortable with how paranoid Miller is and the imagery of
him and Skull Face during the closing cinematic. There was
definitely a lot of "Metal Gear cutscenes" at the end of the game,
which was nice. I've now started Chapter 2 and I'm trucking
along. I did all the Side-Ops I could and I am about to start the
first mission. I have so much development and building happening:
every platform in FOB1 is under-construction and Mother Base just
has one more platform that is under-construction. Similarly, I am
am almost done developing something I've very excited about
playing with: the Wormhole Fulton! Very cool stuff. This game is
so amazing.

learned the big bad's plan, although it is very unclear what his
intentions are towards Snake. He seems totally cool with him, but
Snake of course wants to stop him. Even the giant robot is clearly
not fighting Snake on the big bad's orders. It's very weird. The
ride from one base to the other was very awkward when there wasn't
talking. I noticed that the only thing I could do in the menu was
play tapes, so I played the pooping tape while he was
talking. Unfortunately, the game had no programmed reaction to
that. I'm excited for the resolution. In the last mission, it said
that Eli snuck on the helicopter, but he never did anything,
weird.

interesting that I am now blocked on a lot of building and
deployment projects because of it. It forces me to play the main
missions to make progress there and get them back. I like having
the FOB because I can run more deployments. I'm almost 100% with
construction on Mother Base, so I can start being willing to spend
money on my FOB. I wish I could get the MB coins faster to do
build another FOB. I also don't understand how to get the

the FOB. The White Mamba lesson was interesting, I assume that it
is Liquid Snake. Finally, I am annoyed that I can't easily Fulton
the Child Soldiers. The biggest annoyance is that my helicopter
flies off as I try to run them to the chopper.

Quiet is so awesome and powerful. It is kind of ridiculous. They
do a good job making her useless against vehicles, Skulls, etc. I

pretty difficult, because I'm not used to doing real fighting.

me and got me. Then I tried to get them and the patrol guys
spotted me when I Fulton'd one of the snipers. Then I snuck up on
the tank guy but the tank saw me before I could knock them
out. Then I got spotted while trying to tranq people from
afar... the tank blurted its horn and woke up the ones I had
already got. Finally I did it by getting the snipers, getting one
patrol guy, and then going around and Fultoning the tank. It makes
me think that the Fulton Ballista on the D-Walker would be
awesome.

The mission was particularly challenging because I couldn't have
Quiet with me, since there was no sniper anchor nearby. I've
gotten her up to Bond Level 83. I unlocked the silencer
tranquilizer gun and the Silver outfit. I wonder if the Silver
outfit does anything. I'm getting nervous because I've heard that
you can lose Quiet. She's so awesome, I don't want that.

level up, so I just kept having her shoot guys. I learned how to
use the iDroid to tell her where to go and what mode to be in,
which has made things a lot better. I eventually unlocked the
tranquilizer gun, which is very fun. The AI is reacting really
poorly to her, because they often cannot get to her but they try
to, so the guards are just wiggling against the edge of cliff
hopelessly. It makes it really easy to sneak up on them and grab
them.

I went to the Base Camp and had a great time gathering all the
containers there. On the way, I took out some heavy infantry,
which was funny to fight with Quiet using the Tranq gun, because
it just bounces off their helmets. She managed to shoot one as it
was coming down from a lookout post, so he fell down and got
stunned.

I'm butting up against not having enough fuel to do more base
building. Actually, I have the fuel, but it is not being processed
fast enough so I can't actually use it, which is definitely very
annoying.

I have to admit that it is a bit embarrassing playing the game
when Quiet is on the screen because she is so unnecessarily
sexualized. Luckily that's only during the helicopter sequences.

awesome because I immediately tranq'd everyone and grabbed them
before they could start walking the prisoner away or anything.

After that, I got Quiet and did a few Side-Ops. I don't normally
kill, but I used her to kill lots of fools to try to get her bond
rating up, so I can get the weapons I want with her. I don't feel
like I'm doing it right and I can't get her to follow me. I walked
off into the wilderness and she didn't come at all. Perhaps it's
because of the bond rating. I thought again a lot about how much I
love using the Fulton to get vehicles and containers.
