opens. I like how it is like Symphonia in actually having a world
map, but more detailed because you can see what the enemies are. I
like the combat, although it is not quite as fast as either
Symphonia or Graces. I wish the benefits scaled with the
difficulty, so there'd be a reason to do it other than wanting to
grind more.

Today, I actually played the game and I completed my "teal" line
and then I went down the "orange" line, but accidentally made the
wrong choice and went down the "pink" path after half-way point,
so I will have to switch those when I ultimately do the "pink"
path.

Teal   --- 1 2 [a] 4 [b] 7 [b] 10 [e] 17 [c] 23 [a] 27 30
Orange --- 1 2 [c] 3 [a] 6 [a] 11

I did the first time with Han on Normal and then the second time
with Randy on Easy. It was quite fun!
