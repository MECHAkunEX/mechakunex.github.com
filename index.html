I read
about half of it.

There's an interesting theme of people that are obsessed with other
people and what is happening outside of their control and not
moving on. I'm not sure how productive and praiseworthy this really
is though, because it seems to promote not caring about the dead or
living if you can't contact them, despite knowing for a fact that
they are alive. Basically the idea is that someone without an
active communication channel is just as good as not existing.

The whole conceit of the story, where people age backwards, is very
odd because it seems to punish exactly the sort of people that you
would expect Heaven to reward... those without the blessings of a
long life. The older you live, the more likely you will see your
family again and so on. It's very strange. I would have expected
something more like you'll be reincarnated immediately or that
you'll live until 100 or something.

It also leads to some strange things like that the romance is
between an apparent 15-year old and 19-year old, but the 19-year
was 26 when they died, so they are mentally a 33-year old, which is
a bit odd. I know some 15-ish year-olds that are very mature and
worth talking to and having a relationship with (my attitude being
that a companion has to be able to share experiences and thoughts),
while there are many others with basically nothing to them, so how
could they be a peer? In the book, Liz is not a particular mature
young woman... her main experience is being depressed and helping
to place dogs in homes. The romance is strange in other ways too,
because there's very little except a parallel parking montage to
hold them together. The book basically says, "Why do people fall in
love?"  It's because they hang out together a lot.

The most disturbing part of the book is the way that existence
(life &amp; death) is kind of purposeless. There's no God. There's no
grand design to the cycle. The afterworld is static and unchanging
(although this strains credulity, because presumably there were not
cruise ships and television in 1200 AD, unless Zevin is suggesting
that rogue spirits gave away these secrets.)

There's a slightly inkling that the meta-ethics of the book are
that art is the greatest good, because you can see the work of
Picasso/etc in their spirit life, but on the other hand there's a
huge amount of spirit who hold jobs that are purely bureaucratic in
nature (running the ship, announcing who is coming, etc) or related
to mental health (taking care of people's fragile minds.) The
mental health angle could suggest that the greatest good is
relationships and other people, which it seems like Liz will mostly
experience, but the book's world is depressing on this front,
without children or the opportunity to see loved ones again, and so
on. In this way, I feel that the book is very Buddhist in that the
cycle of rebirth is a giant terrible prison.

--

The book moves too quickly and has too much "telling" rather than
"showing". In particular, I think that a lot of scenes move with
100% dialogue rather than any prose or description, so you don't
get enough of the character's internal state. The drama surrounding
Liz almost returning to Earth was totally subdued because of
this. The book is its own Cliff's Notes in the later parts.

The very last scene of the book was very sad, mainly because of the
disturbing finality of it.

some places where it is great, like seeing the beautiful dresses

bland and everything is just expected, like I've watched the movie

gone and dealing with that; not being sure what she says you did
wrong; etc. I really like the mystery, mentioned in the third
