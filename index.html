I went from 400ft to 650ft. It was
very tense and I had some crazy encounters. I'm learning a lot
about how things in the game work and having a very good time. I
kept track of all the things that I got so I'd remember:

400ft - Stealth 1 -&gt; 3
400ft - Will 3 -&gt; 9
400ft - Inner Light
400ft - Disguise
450ft - Stealth 3 -&gt; 5
450ft - Archery 5 -&gt; 7
450ft - Crowd Fighting
500ft - Assassination
500ft - Stealth 5 -&gt; 6
550ft - Stealth 6 -&gt; 8
550ft - Song 3 -&gt; 6
550ft - Song of Silence
550ft - Vanish
550ft - Keen Senses
600ft - Perception 8
650ft - Listen
650ft - Will 6

I am abusing save states a lot, but I don't feel too bad about it,
because the game is so hard and kind of random in some ways. I
actually like it so much better, because it feels more like a big
puzzle that I'm figuring out how to get through.

My main strategy is to stealth around and if something is worth
fighting (high EXP reward for killing it), then I stealth kill it,
then run away and hide then do it again, or I launch arrows at it
from a distance before kiting again. It is very fun!

of winning strategies, like
http://angband.oook.cz/forum/showthread.php?t=5300.

I started a game and did extremely well just because I had made
some intelligent decisions about what to do. I used a Faenor with
3/4/4/3 and I made Evasion and Melee both 10. I started to have
backups of my saves too. At 150ft, I got Dodging and Sprinting. At
250ft, I got Lore-Keeper. At 300ft, I got Finesse and enough
Perception so I could get Lore-Master shortly. At 350, I got
Lore-Master. At 350, I also got Zone of Control. 350ft ended up
being a really hard floor with lots of stuff going on. I ended up
getting Flanking too.

roguelikes: I don't feel like I am progressing when I play. It
seems like success is mostly random, so there's not that much
strategy or skill to develop, and there's nothing inside of the
game to acquire to make my character stronger, so it is only as
good as the second-to-second play experience. The user interface
is ever so slightly annoying and I feel like most of the strategy
is obvious, so there's not a lot to think about during each
move. This makes it more like a flashy version of something like
Sudoku. The game is definitely extremely well made and I
appreciate it.
