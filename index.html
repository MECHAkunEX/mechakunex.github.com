side-missions. I like unlocking more functions of Mother Base and
I think I'm getting to the end. I had a hard time getting the
Wandering Soldier, but called a supply drop and got a non-lethal
Uzi and took it down with that. I did the tank mission and totally
failed shooting missiles at them from the first base, so I then
snuck into the fort and put four blocks of C4 on each of them. The
first I did one, then one, then two, which was annoying to keep
going back and forth to it, whereas the second I just loaded up
with all four all at once, which worked great. I feel like I'm not
going back to Mother Base enough and I won't get D-Dog when I
want.

guys that kill the prisoner and go to where the Honeybee is. I
didn't fight the Skulls, because I assumed I was supposed to run
away. I plan on going back and doing the missions again once I can
Fulton larger things. I did a few other side-ops and took over
some bases. Annoyingly, I died on two of those with only two
enemies left. In the first case, they got me because I thought I
was covered after they same me and I blew up. On the other, I
accidentally jump out of a guard tower and fell to my death
because I thought I would land on the outpost wall. Dumb, and
totally my fault, but very annoying that the checkpoint put me
back before I had done anything at all to the base. This game is
so much fun. My only complaint is that it is a bit annoying to
travel around the map when my side-ops are all over the place.

I did the prologue mission and found it very crazy and thought
provoking as to what the game will really be about. I found it
hard to know what I was supposed to do when being chased on the
horse. After the prologue, the game got stuck during the install,
so I had to troubleshoot that, which was annoying.

I did the first mission and took over the first outpost, but not
the second. I like the UI and way that you interact with the game
a lot. I have a strangely huge amount of love for the UI's
voice. She sounds so peaceful and calm. I liked the first mission,
although it felt like I couldn't do anything to get around the
Skulls, but according to the extra mission options, I can.

After that, I did the next mission and tried to Fulton everything
I possibly could, which caused me to spend a long time and get
spotted a lot because I was focusing on that. I think "Fulton
everything" is going to be my MO in this game.

I think I played for too long, but it was nice to get into it a
lot on my playing.

I explored the second half of the Nightmare of Mensis and did
everything there. I had a lot of trouble with the Brain Trust
enemies and the Maneater Pigs. Eventually I got around the Pigs by
sneaking through the waterway to their left. I found the boss of
the area to be very fun and a little challenging. I whacked it
with Bolt Paper and was pretty careful. The hardest part was when
it made the purple fog and summoned a clone. I had a hard time
switching out of my great-sword mode so I could do a quick swipe
on the clone.

After that I got the Umbilical Cord from Arianna and fought
Gehrman. I found him to be very challenging. I had to grind a
little every few attempts to have enough Blood Vials. But the last
time I fought him, I only had 17 and didn't use very many. The key
was learning when to try for a Visceral Strike and when to be
aggressive. I also used Bolt Paper on him right before he
transformed so I could get a ton of damage on him during his
transformation. That worked out really well.

I beat the Moon Presence on the second try after adjusting my
runes and being a little bit more careful. I also used Bolt Paper.

I really enjoyed this game. I felt like the combat was much more
tense and the environment much more creepy than the Souls games. I
found myself using items a lot more than in a Souls game. For
instance, by the end of a Souls game I have basically never used
any of the weapon buffs, but in this I used them a lot. I think it
was because I had no other use for Insight and it was a resource
that couldn't really be taken away, so I bought lots of supplies
like that.

My final stats were as follows:
Level: 94
Vitality: 30
Endurance: 40
Strength: 36
Skill: 25
Bloodtinge: 7
Arcane: 6

I used Ludwig's Holy Blade and upgraded it to +10 and had on the
two +18% and then a +12% (I think) gems, so its final attack power
was 580.
