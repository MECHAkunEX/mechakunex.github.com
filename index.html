Floor 8, Lots of close calls.

Floor 9, A hard layout and very little dust.

Floor 10, This was really hard because I kept having my crystal
attacked and it just snowballed a lot.

Floor 11, I explored a lot of the floor, but left after running
out one direction and having no more dust to power that side of
the floor.

Floor 12, I went the wrong direction, but then ran out as I found
the exit and won! Woot.

I had fun with this game, but can't really imagine wanting to play
it again. The game makes a lot of sense and is pretty
straight-forward to play. I can tell that they tried very hard to
add lots and lots of other things to it so that there would be
depth to it, but I didn't find anything other than Food and the
dinky offensive Pods to be useful at all. I don't have much of an
interesting in trying the other things, because it would just seem
like an artificial constraint.

definitely tempting. But I think I wrestled myself away correctly.

pretty well crushed it. When I first played, I assumed that it
would be more important to have a lot of industry generators,
because that seemed like it would be better for the long term, but
I didn't realize how short the levels would be. The tutorial
suggested that food was much better, because you could level up
your characters and that would last the whole game, since you were
not reset from floor-to-floor, like modules were. I think this has
been the key.

The problem, however, is that so far I have built literally
nothing but food generators and a few of the pea shooters. It
seems strange that the game would have so much more content
(i.e. other things to build) but have them not actually be
useful. Either the game is stupid or I am stuck in a local maxima
and it will come to hurt me as I get more deep into the game.

I am presently on floor five with four characters.

how formulaic it is in getting Mack to The Shack: Missy exists just

Once he's at The Shack, there's lots and lots of cliches and things
that sound really stupid to a *REDACTED*. Many of Mack's questions have
much more concrete answers in *REDACTED*ism, so it is annoying to hear

strategy might be to open a door and then always run back towards
the crystal, which I have reinforced with some attack pods. The

Sector   1: Shields 2, Engines 4, Medbay 2
Sector 2-4: Doors, Drones
Sector 5-7: Shields 3, Engines 5, All 2

I am almost at the end and I am doing really well. I got quite a
few good weapon upgrades. I really like having many different
weapons shooting at the same time. I have high hopes for this run.

I went up against the leader and was totally destroyed. My pilot
area was hacked and on fire, so I couldn't escape. He died and
then it was really down hill after that. Ouch. I guess I'll try
again.

--

I did a few experiments with things like boarding and cloaking,
but couldn't use them very well. It was frustrating.

--

I won my first two rounds with the big ship but died after
that. It was a bummer. I think I wasted a repair cycle. I did it
again and this time I had a Hull Repair drone. I think that made
all the difference, because I never deployed my drones except for
that and a Systems Repair one. This made it so I could heal during
battle and I did it! Woo!

I can see why this was such a huge hit, but I feel like a lot of
the complicated stuff, like Cloaking and micro-management of where
your characters are is not my cup of tea. Then, what is left is
pretty funny, but also a bit too much of "stand around waiting
until something happens". I feel like a more efficient
(i.e. turn-based) version of the game would be more obviously less
interesting, almost like a clicker.
