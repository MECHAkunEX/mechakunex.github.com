Later in the day I played for another hour and did World 2. I died
3-1 and 3-2 but then died and decided to switch games. Something
I'm noticing a lot is that the characters have much larger hit
boxes than you'd expect them to and I keep getting hit by
surprise.

tiny bit different than the other games too.

I played for another two and half hours and got up to after the
first Fortress of World 6. This game is so good. I feel kind of
bad though that there's no incentive to do every level and, in
fact, because I'm so worried about conserving lives, I purposely
try to avoid doing more levels than necessary. For instance, I
didn't do 5-3 this time and get the Shoe. Anyways... what a great
game!

This game is so
rad. The flow is amazing. I did 4-3 on my second try in continuous
run. 5-1 had a really good flow, but was pretty tough. 5-3 was
really hard, but I was able to continuously run through the
beginning part. It was so sweet.

--

Later in the day I played for another forty minutes. I beat 5-4,
which had some great flow. 6-1, which had a really cool beginning
with the three turtles that you can use to whack the Hammer
turtle. I messed up quite a bit at the water pool though. I did
6-2 really quickly, despite being a painful water level.

I really like playing through all the levels as small Mario
because it makes it so much more tense to not be allowed a single
hit. But also, power-ups are really scarce in this game, so it's
kind of necessary.

Potter. This one is distinguished by being focused on a young
woman---in a way reminiscent of Twilight. Furthermore, it starts
with the grittiness and violence that Harry Potter ended with. The
movie has a lot of plot in it... I felt like there were many
opportunities for it to be finished with exposition and just move
on, but it didn't. Despite all this plot, there were some weird
unexplained things: like why did Bane show up in the Institute?
What happen to Simon being a vampire? There were a lot of hokey
moments---like the rain during the kiss. But overall, it was pretty
enjoyable.

I really disliked the moment of ironic sexism when Clary says, "Why
will it help my mom if I dress like a hooker?" We're supposed to
say, "Isn't she smart for saying that?" But the movie still puts
her on display and doesn't react to her, except for the guy (who
turns out to be her brother) who says, "Actually you look great",
which causes Clary to blush. Thus, we learn that boys like you when
you dress like a hooker. Great.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/11/29/Game--Illusion-of-Gaia--SNES--1993--4.html">Game: Illusion of Gaia (SNES, 1993) (5)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/11/">11</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/11/29/">29</a></span></span><pre class="content">I finished the game today. It was so much fun and I'm so impressed
by the little things about the game. The music and graphics are
great. The gameplay is really good. The story and moments are
cute.

I found the Mt. Temple map very confusing. It was very endearing
and touching how Hamlet sacrificed himself and then talking to the
tribe afterwards was cool.

I love that you get Shadow. He's so rad, but he doesn't totally
break the game. The Mummy Queen especially is really hard. She was
much harder than the final boss for me. I died like 8 times on the
second round with her. The second round with the Vampires was hard
too.

I was so annoyed at how slow the text moved at the end of the
game. Blah.
