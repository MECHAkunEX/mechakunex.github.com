I did a few more hunts (or at least, I
tried to) and then I went through the end game. I kept missing the
start time on some of the hunts, which was very frustrating. It
would be nice if there was an item that would allow you to
manipulate time. While I was walking around, Aranea dropped out of
the sky to help, which was really cool. When I did the last base,
the reintroduction of the generals was pretty lame because they
had made such a weak impact on the story overall. The endgame was
pretty cool with some rad fights. I thought the photo book was a
very good touch. The game tried to get you to really feel like you
had gone on a big journey. (It's just like Earthbound, actually!)
I was very happy to hear the fanfare and see Noctis reunited with
Luna at the end, but honestly, I don't really understand what that
scene was supposed to mean.

My plan is to do the end-game once all the DLC comes out and I'll
come back to the game at that point.

Overall, I feel like this is an extremely well put together game,
with a memorable setting and some good characters. There's a lot
of character pay-off that I wanted to see, like Luna and Aranea
and the motivations of the villains, that was really lacking. On a
mechanical level, it was pretty boring with a single strategy that
works the whole game, unlike FF13 which has a variety of
strategies (~27) that you have to learn and adapt to the
situation. In essentially every single battle, you do the same
thing. It's pretty boring in that way. The open-world, however,
gives you a really addictive TODO list to fill out. I feel like
this game will be remembered better than FF13, but I like it much
much less. I feel no desire at all to complete every Hunt or get
every level, because I already feel totally untouchable in combat.

Demon Wall, although I couldn't put a dent in it. The amount of
demons roaming around the world is very intimidating. I went back
in time once I got control and did a bunch of quests. It was weird
that the bros didn't have more reconnecting, but I assume they
will just drip-feed it.

good at video games, you can just destroy everything by dodging
well. Prompto's whole plot reveal makes no sense and I dislike
that there's no explanation of why the emperor's clothes are just
lying around. I'm confused about what I'm supposed to believe
about the empire. I think we're supposed to think that there's no
people there and Ardyn destroyed them all and made them demons?

SO pissed that she is dead, after so much build up and you
basically never get to see her with Noctis at all... they just
barely glance at each other. The game does an excellent job making
you feel the emotions of the characters... it's just that they
suck bad. Ugh, I haven't been this mad at a game/story in a long
