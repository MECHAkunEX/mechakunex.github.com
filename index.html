chunks. In the first chunk I finished my exterminations, killing
off the Hoplites in the Yusnaan factory, then the Zomoks, and
Dreadnoughts in Luxerion and then I went to the palace in Yusnaan
for the Skata'ne. 

This allowed me to complete all the Canvas of Prayers. I spent the
next chunk of time gathering Soul Seeds in the Luxerion bridge
area and got the Elixir. Thus, I was able to do everything except
Luka and Aeronite by the end of the 11th day.

In the in-between sequence of days 11 and 12, it was interesting
to see LRFF13 so clearly reveal that it would eventually return to
the Ur-JRPG and be about killing God. The first game was kind of
like that too, because you kill the "fal'Cie God", but by that
time you had learned that they weren't really God-like. In
contrast, Lightning wants to kill Bhunivelze while believing that
he really did make the world.

On the beginning of the 12th day, I went and fought Aeronite. It
took a few tries with different strategies and paying close
attention to which buttons I mapped the various actions too. (For
instance, make sure to put the -ara spell on the same button in
each schemata.) I did it by abusing Overclock and had to use a
Phoenix Wing, Crusader Potion, Nektar of the Gods, and two
Ethers. It felt like an okay expense, because supposedly he's the
hardest enemy. It was a very tense 6'30" but I was happy to do it.

After that, I went to the Wildlands and Yusnaan to buy some
weapons that I read about on forums that would be useful for
Aeronite: the +1300 STR weapon from Yusnaan, the ATB shields from
the Research Camp, and the ultra magic weapons from Jagd. This was
the first time I spent any money at forges in the whole game---and
I only have two bosses to go! I spent a lot of money though. I
went from 1.5 mil gil to about 90k.

Finally, I was struck today that the dress-up mechanics of this
game are very similar to Resonance of Fate. This is funny because
RoF was made by Tri-Ace, which worked on FF13-2. And, RoF was
released almost the same day as FF13-1 and is perceived to have
bombed in its shadow. It's interesting that FF13 returned to and
borrowed stuff from that game. I really liked RoF, btw.

I still enjoyed it, but some cliches
appear to be coming out that drag it down a little. For instance,
the writer writing about a writer writing a book is becoming a bit
thicker; the son being the best kid in the school is too perfect;
the father losing his brother in an undisclosed way; and, finally
at the end of chapter 13, he ends with the school doing something
slightly sinister. I would expect the book to more powerful and
interesting if the school is totally on the level, but it was just
a story about the regret and growing up-angst that the father
feels.

Another thing that bugs me so far is that the father doesn't seem
to be concerned about how the son feels about the
school. Apparently, they've had regular interaction because they
talk about quarterly visits and how Christopher wasn't needy. But
how would Christopher feel about leaving the school? Presumably he
feels alienation for the same reasons that the father feels
longing. I know that when I was young, I wouldn't appreciate being
pulled out of what I like to satisfy my dad's need for family
time. In fact, I /know/ that I would dislike it, because I did
dislike it when it really happened to me. I hope that the book
explores these issues and the son isn't just a McGuffin.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2014/">2014</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2014/02/20/Game--Lightning-Returns--Final-Fantasy-XIII--PS3--2014--9.html">Game: Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (PS3, 2014) (10)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2014/">2014</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2014/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2014/02/20/">20</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played today for about three hours and just exterminated

the remaining ones are related to the ultimate monsters. I read a

in the Wildlands is the best because Chocobodin helps you. The
Reaver's sword is amazing and it inspired me to change up my

optimized around long combos with it. It seems to be performing
