dungeon. 

Like its prequel, Neutopia 2 seemed perfect to me as a kid: a more
beautiful version of Zelda on an exotic Japanese console! What
could be better?

After playing it for a while, I found it a very sub-par copy of
Zelda. There are lots of little things that made it that way:

* One of the important things to me about Zelda is that power-ups
are not just "keys" but are generally useful throughout the
dungeons for lots of little purposes. In contrast, the first
power-up you get in this game is new Armor and you get the
impression that new Armor and Weapons will be a recurring
power-up. I think that power-ups like this are the laziest
because they replace a more interesting difficulty curve and
challenge with a ratcheting up of numbers alone.

* An essential piece of the Zelda meta-game is preserving your
health until you fight the boss deep in the dungeon after an
unsuccessful run. The "puzzles" in Zelda whereby you must
destroy all the enemies in a room before you can push forward
necessitates engaging with most enemies, and thus risking
damage. I found that in the first dungeon of this game I could
generally casually walk past enemies without much fear of
danger.

* A key piece of a good game is that it teaches you how to win and
rewards you for learning a "useful" skill. A classic example is
a boss fight where the boss moves relatively predictably and you
must learn their moves and exploit them. It is essential that
the boss actually give you clues to their moves, however. The
Sand Worm boss in the first dungeon of Neutopia 2, which is a
knock-off a similar Zelda boss, doesn't give such cues. It
appears randomly and selects a random spot to land in, often
going so high in the air and with such erratic curves that it is
impossible to track and anticipate. This feels un-fair and not
fun.

* Finally, a much smaller issue, I feel like the "upgrade" to
Zelda wherein you can walk on almost any pixels but it is very
easy to get mis-aligned with the enemy and very difficult to
hit.

Nevertheless, I wouldn't say the game is horrible, but it clearly
is not in the "canon" that I am trying to discover, so after
giving it its due (by beating the first level), I abandoned it.

It is interesting how clearly it is a sequel to Shining in the

different game-play.

Even though the attack options are pretty small, even in the first
three battles I felt like there was a lot of strategy to be had in
planning what I would do. However, it was excruciating to wait for
enemies to do nothing and a lot of the interface was much too slow
for my patience.

The extent to which this is a knock-off of Zelda cannot be
overstated. It is very clearly intended to be the same. I feel
like the SMS colors are a bit brighter and nicer, but with less
variety overall. The main character looks like Rocket Knight, and
kind of weird to me.

In terms of game play, it's fine, but not very special. I found
that the movement was a lot smoother than in Zelda, but that this
was a little problematic because it felt like you "slid" up to
enemies and couldn't stop in front of them. The first boss fight
wasn't very tough and it was much easier in general than Zelda
because the enemies didn't seem to respawn when you died and
continued.

Under the philosophy of only playing amazing games, I decided not
to continue, although I can appreciate that it seems like a
perfectly passable game.

This game is so bizarre and iconic for me. I had it when I was a

today. For instance, I love that all veggies do damage to you and
how off kilter the enemies are: like the Opera lady or the band of
chickens. The people who help you, like Santa and the Carrot guy,
are so funny too.

Overall, I find the gameplay to pretty boring though. It
definitely is low key and lets you "chill" while playing, but it
also lacks any real excitement. Nevertheless, it is very cool that
it is a roguelike: random maps, random treasures, hunger,
etc. Bizarre.

nervous about the ending area, because the Head-hugger Metroids
are always such a pain in Metroid games.

Later in the day I played for about thirty minutes and beat it. I
first waltzed to the Queen Metroid and was destroyed. The
Head-huggers weren't hard. But the Queen was. So I restarted and
used a Save state (my first in the game) outside the Queen's
chamber. I eventually beat it on my sixth or seventh try after
that using the Stomach technique. It was fun. My final time was
03:20, which means I spent about 1:09 on wasted runs.

I'd say that this is a good game, but not as amazing as other
ones.

that this was the first one in the series. When I started playing
though, I was very surprised with how similar things are: the
Gemma Knights, all the enemies are similar, and the store keepers
are dancing guys. It is also interesting to see the connection to
Final Fantasy: the hero sprite is clearly adapted from the Final
Fantasy 1 Fighter.

I found the translation to be pretty horrific, but in a charming
way. I died on my way back from getting the Mattock and I hadn't
yet saved... I think. I never got a dialogue to save and when I
got back to the title screen and tried to Continue, my finger
slipped and I pressed New Game. (Maybe the problem was with the
emulator, because I also had trouble moving the cursor around to
just where I wanted.)

It was pretty annoying for that to happen, but I'm not too torn
up. I think it's unlikely that I will complete the game. There's
something about Gameboy graphics on my big TV that makes my head
hurt, plus I know that 'Sword of Mana' on the GBA is a remake of
this, and presumably better.

Metroid 2. When I heard that the sequel to the great Metroid was
on the GB, I was very surprised. Now that I'm older, I realize it
has to do with the designers of the Gameboy and the designers of
Metroid being the same people.

In any case, this game definitely feels like Metroid. Even though
it has smaller, discrete "levels", the areas are big enough to
have multiple paths and require thinking about how you're going to
go through them.

I got up to the Save Point in Area 2. At this point, the greatest
take-away on the game is that the Spider Ball is very unintuitive
to use, because you don't need to change the direction you push as
the balls moves, until you stop moving and try to restart. The
other thing is that the gameplay doesn't feel as "cramped" as the
screen is. It's clear that it has been designed to never put
anything too far away so that you won't see it. Very well
designed.

I will beat this. (Although I'm super stuck at the moment... I
have very little health and can't find a place to heal up.)

but still was not moved.

The graphics were a lot better right away, but the slow movement
was still there. The theming of the castle was pretty bad... big
empty rooms, nothing to suggest it is a "throne room" and the
opening sequence was pretty bold in its simplicity.

The menu interface was pretty novel with the response message
being displayed in place. It was kind of neat, but ultimately
pretty painful. The equipping interface was particularly painful.

It took a very long time to figure out how I was supposed to
save. I guessed that it would happened when I went to the inn and
it felt a little weird to start fighting before I saved, but I did
so I wouldn't waste the money.

The battle music was so bad and the interface was very
confusing. Once I realized what the things meant it was pretty
smooth, at least until I wanted to pick my actions
individually. Then it was real bad, because when you want to do
something non-automatic the sequence is: Manual &gt; *REDACTED*acter &gt;
Confirm? &gt; Selection &gt; Target &gt; Auto. Ouch.

I wandered around, found two towns and a cave, but then died
without any clue what I was supposed to do next.

I can't imagine playing through it because it felt so tedious in
so many ways.

anything about it. It's basically a Japanese first-person dungeon
crawler. The anime scene introducing the story was cute, as is the
interface of walking around the town and talking to people. Once
you're in the dungeon... it is a first-person dungeon crawl with
no map.

It's clear how you would beat the game: build your own map and
meticulously track where you are in it. I am way too old to do
that. Maybe if I wrote a program to build the map for me, I would
consider it, but I can't imagine actually having a piece of graph
paper in front of me. The biggest pain is not just having the map
but keeping track of where you are on it while you're playing. I
glanced at a map of the first level online but realized it was
useless.

The shop interface has the classic problem of not knowing if an
item is better and not allowing you to equip it. What a pain.

The combat is very straight forward with only one choice at any
time. I expect that you get more people and can cast spells, but
it doesn't feel like the combat will be very compelling.

Overall, that means it's a drop.
