The first half was
wandering around in the new world until I ran into the forest
where you meet the moogles. Moogles are so cute and I'm glad they
were introduced in this game... yet another thing that FF5 started
and shares with FF6. I love their song.

Next, I got to Galuf's castle and spent a lot of time grinding in
the basement. I'm closing to getting my characters to the point of
being Freelancers. Well, about half-way. I think I'm done grinding
jobs now because I have a good repertoire that will last for a
long time.

Also, I'm about to leave on a trip, so I'll be away from my SNES
for a while. When I get back, I doubt I'll want to spend the time
grinding... although maybe a little to get back into the feel of
the game.

Galuf's world. I still haven't really ventured outside the first
few jobs, because I'm focusing on mastering them. Most of the jobs
that seem exciting, like Dragoon, aren't really that good when you
read the details about them.

Some of the bosses in this game are really finicky with the random
number generator. For example, the boss of the Ancient *REDACTED*rary
creamed me the first four times, then when I prepared a new
strategy, he never even attacked! He just used status effects and
didn't make use of them.

Something annoying about this game (and almost all other RPGs)
after playing Mystic Quest is that you can't jump over people who
are in your way!

When I learned about Butz' history, it was a little to awkward
for his dad to yell, "Stella!"

Finally, after getting the airship, I found it very confusing what
I was supposed to do... I just wandered around trying to find new
places to go... eventually I accidentally discovered you had to go
/back/ to the ruins.

I think next time I play I'll have to grind a little, because I'm
finding the random battles taking too much out of me.

and the PowerPak. This game was the first translation I ever heard
of or tried to play. I have a distinct memory of playing it when I
was very young on an early (bad) emulator with a bad PC
controller. When I played again, I remembered up until the ship
graveyard, but nothing really after that, even though I know I
played further.

The game is really interesting when compared to FF4 and FF6. It
really is just between them in lots of different ways and there's
a lot of shared content. For example, the graphics and art assets
between FF4 and FF6 are totally different, but I can see
sprites/etc in FF5 that are in both. (Examples: The mountains in
FF5 are used in FF6. The werewolf and dragon sprites are also
shared. Some of the monsters, in battle, are the same as FF4.)
Overall, I'd say that the overworld/map looks more like FF6 but
the UI/in-battle art looks more like FF4.

There are some convenience things that are more like one or the
other too. For example, you can "optimize" your equipment, but you
can't see if a weapon in a store is going to be better or
worse. Also, the L/R buttons don't switch between characters in
the menu sub-screens... which is really inconvenient.

Another interesting thing is to think about the characters... in
FF4 you have 5 characters at a time and a very large cast with
detailed interactions that cause them to move in and out of the
party. In FF6, its the same, but with only 4 at a time. FF5 is
totally different. You immediately get the 4 characters and they
never change. Furthermore, I find them to be relatively
blank-slate characters compared to those in FF4/6, and not only
because the job system makes them so flexible.

Finally, there are interesting references. The first one is that
in FF5e, you can let "Lone Wolf", a thief, out of jail. He, of
course, shows up in FF6.

--

On the actual game, I really like it. The story is fun and the
combat system is great. The job system is cool, especially the
beautiful sprites for each job. (I also like it how when a
character is downed in battle, they lose their outfit, like it was
a magical super-hero costume.) The system is quite overwhelming
though, it feels like it is really easy to make a bad choice with
what to do.

I played for a little less than seven hours and got up the Ancient
*REDACTED*rary. The only time I needed to grind was to beat Shiva.

My wife and I
were blown away by the actors abilities to act and sing so well
together. The lyrics and songs were great. My favourite part of the
concept is that there's no normal dialogue... it is all song.

The only bad part was how much of it was based on stupid people and
their stupid, brash decisions. I thought the majority of the
"emotional" scenes were signs of bad morals and ideas, so it was
hard to be very touched by them. The most moving part of the film
is when Jean Valjean is helped by the Bishop of Digne. Fantine's "I
Dreamed a Dream" was very powerful, but stupid overall.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/04/19/Game--Cybernator--SNES--1992--0.html">Game: Cybernator (SNES, 1992)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/04/">04</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/04/19/">19</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this for about forty-five minutes.

The concept of this game is really interesting and cool, but the
implementation is pretty bad. The details of fighting are
terrible. Enemies just go near you and you get hit and can get
hit-stun-locked very easily. The exactness of each bite you need
to land is pretty rough too. I think the worst part of the
game... at least what I played... was the ridiculous amount of
grinding you needed to do to get anything. Platformers with
grinding like this are the worst... particularly when it isn't fun
to fight.

the game other than the controls is a bit too messy for my
taste. For example, the larger enemies don't give you any
indication of how damaged they are. It was so bad that I thought
the game was broken during the boss fight. Second, the hit
detection is really bad... you need to be perfectly aligned with
enemies, despite seeing your bullets hit them. Very annoying.

over, I can watch it. I thought the first episode was fun. I
liked the actors and the action was interesting. I think the two
scientists characters will have to grow on me a little, because I
think they act a little too extreme-to-type. The world it seems
to be creating is neat.

I found a lot of the minor details of the plot to be
obvious---for example, you can't have a guy tell a girl he loves
her (and have her be happy about it) on the first episode, unless
you're going to kill him or cause him to be a bad guy: and they
did both!

I think my only complaint about it is the way "fringe science" is
used as some weird boogey-man discussed in hushed tones, as if
anyone in the real world actually cares about it. It was also
weird that "artificial intelligence" is listed as one of the
fringe science ideas in the beginning. Finally, it's so lazy in
the title sequence that the same terms are repeated and it's not
even trying to depict "moving around a space" where the letters
are.

It's also a little lame that in the very first episode we see
Agent Dunham half-naked in bed and then it's a crucial plot point
that she has to disrobe to her underwear for us to gawk at. It's
especially ridiculous because part of the character background is
that she's not respected by people (who constantly call her
"sweetheart") for being a woman and that she is a particularly
strong woman and defender of woman (in her defense of the raped
women in her past). This is so ridiculous, because in one part of
the show we're supposed to be appalled by the bad behavior of the
men vis-a-vis her gender, but in another part the producers put
