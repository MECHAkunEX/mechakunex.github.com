with a team, and beat it, so I did it again on my world with a
small team and won. I went over to the Kiln of the First Flame and
fought the boss a few times and then went at it myself. It was a
totally epic fight. I love the way the area looked. It was really
neat to see all the swords from people before. We did. I ended at
Soul Level 110. Now I can watch YouTube videos and see what it all
meant!

This was an awesome game! I can't wait to come back for the DLC. I
got the season pass, so I committed to playing it. I've never
played any DLC for these games before, so that will be an
experience.

it. I felt like the movie kind of fell apart when Evan had super

Lannisters are pretty terrible, I don't trust the High Sparrow at
all. It was so awesome to have Sansa and Jon get together. It's
the first time Starks have been together in such a long
time. That scene was totally epic. Part of me thinks that the
letter from Ramsay was faked by Sansa. The events at the Vale
were fun. Littlefinger is so sneaky, it's great. I was almost
convinced that Osha would get Ramsay. Theon's story is neat.

But, oh man, Daenerys. Wow.
