It was so much fun and I'm so impressed
by the little things about the game. The music and graphics are
great. The gameplay is really good. The story and moments are
cute.

I found the Mt. Temple map very confusing. It was very endearing
and touching how Hamlet sacrificed himself and then talking to the
tribe afterwards was cool.

I love that you get Shadow. He's so rad, but he doesn't totally
break the game. The Mummy Queen especially is really hard. She was
much harder than the final boss for me. I died like 8 times on the
second round with her. The second round with the Vampires was hard
too.

I was so annoyed at how slow the text moved at the end of the
game. Blah.

At the end of the game, it was so
painful to have to switch airships to go back to the Manor,
especially because the Invincible is so slow. The end of the game
was pretty straight-forward, with my amazing Black Belts, but it
was very dangerous because they couldn't take damage well. When I
got to the very final boss, I was killed. It was so painful
because there isn't a save anywhere close to it... unless I'm
stupid and missed it. I didn't want to replay the final two hours
of grueling fights, so I just watched the ending of YouTube. It's
kind of a depressing way to the end the game.

Overall, I thought the game was very fun. It had a very
interesting job system, like FF5, but had a much simpler and fast
plot like FF1. I thought the game was a bit easy, or at least that
it didn't force you to have really interesting strategies if you
were willing to grind out your melee fighters. For instance, I
didn't use any offensive magic jobs at all the whole time, but I
did have my White Mage use his staff to cast attack spells a
lot. Definitely an enjoyable game.
