The fight with Alternis is great, although it kind of sucks that
they don't change it if you have done the Vampire side
quest. Alternis is Ringabel!?

This is so weird! It's like Groundhog Day.

I started Chapter 5 at Level 74 with 2 Mastered Jobs. But then I
spent about two hours getting everyone to Level 99 and mastering
all jobs except for one, which I don't have yet. I started to beat
some of the Asterisks again, but you don't seem to get anything
for doing it, but it is nice to see the scene. I like trying to
pick a strategy that wins on Auto. It's a fun constraint.

trophies. At first, I just wandered around the world and did
stuff, for about three hours. Then I realized that if I just
wanted to get the trophies and not beat the game again, I could
just go get accessories. So I switched and did that. It only took
about 30 minutes more after that. I restarted and got all the
accessories again in just an hour. It was nice to complete
everything. I don't feel like the Pallas Athena garb is great
though.

Overall, I love this game. I think I prefer it to FF13-2, but not
FF13-1. This series is just so good. The battle system is amazing
and the story is so nuts. I like that this game doesn't have any
mindless grindy parts. Even fighting the Last Ones is really fun
because they are bosses. I think the main disadvantage of this
game versus the others is that there aren't as many bosses or
crazy enemies. Still, the combat is so amazing.

I had
some fun boss fights. I was able to beat Othros in two rounds: the
first using Invigorate and then using Hidden Dragon. I used almost
the same strategy against the Summoner but because I knew the
fight was coming, I turned everyone into Monks and beat her in a
single round using just Hidden Dragons. 

On the other hand, when I fought the Time Mage &amp; Sword Fencer and
Ranger, I didn't see the fight coming so I fought them with really
weak and weird jobs, like a Freelancer, Merchant, Thief, and Time
Mage.

I'm trying to get Level 9 on most of jobs. I did, however, just
decide to get Level 10 on Freelancer so I can get the JP%
increase.

Also, since I got the Summoner job, I need to go back to the Wind
Temple, where I noticed the Summoner guy. I'm currently partly
through Mt. Fragmentum.

I really enjoy the game still, but am definitely overpowered from
playing at 200% Encounter Rate. For instance, when I switched to
Chapter 2, everyone was level 36 and I had two jobs each at level
9, plus one other job at level 6.

Something I really like about the game, but am surprised about, is
that when you beat the job enemies they really die. It's intense.

I really liked the ending. It was very nice to remember the whole

I turned on the New Game+ on Hard for a little bit just to see how
things worked. I feel like I won't like doing every Side Quest
again because it is so "busy" but I will like fighting again. I
think the biggest thing I'm worried about is that it will take a
lot of time to get the materials to get the upgrade trophies. I
found that skipping the cut-scenes was a little annoying and slow.
