ridiculously hard. The very very last boss was tough, but just
took a little bit of practice to get the pattern down. It almost
feels like a bonus stage now in comparison with the one before
it. I think I will put this game on a monthly
play-through-the-whole-game-on-Easy rotation, so I can remember
its awesomeness forever.

I ended with Asbel at level
80, which is crazy to me, because I was roughly that level after
getting to Zhonecage (after almost 100 hours) the first time. I
had 518 encounters in the New Game+, the total battle time was 48
minutes, which means the average battle length was 5.5 seconds!
It's also pretty amazing to me that only 9% of my play time was
fighting this time, especially because I skipped every cut-scene,
had 2x movement speed, and was just running from boss to boss.

I've decided that I'm done with the game. The only things left
that I could do is (a) get all the Carta cards, which would be
super tedious; (b) get the Turtlez Togz from the Dark Turtlez,
which would be super tedious; (c) get the Eleth Mixer to 9999,
which even checking out what apparently is the fastest way to do
it, would be crazy; and, (d) get the title trophies for the men,
which would probably be painful because it mean having lots of
battles and managing what skills they used.

This was a very fun game. The battle system is great and the story
is a lot of fun. The world is cool too. I think my only complaints
about it are very minor: the user interface on some things could
have been better. For example, being able to have sets of AI
settings for different situations, sets of mixer settings as well,
and being able to pick a result you wanted from the dualizing
system (that you had already discovered) rather than having to
remember the recipe in your head. The AI was also pretty
unreliable as a healer. I found that it almost never tried to
resurrect dead characters and if you told it to, then it was hit,
it would not remember what your last instruction was. This was
very annoying.

The
total time to win was 6 hours and 12 minutes. Something amazing
happened, I had the various spheres on the mixer the entire time
and finally got 1 Darkened Ore in the last hour of gameplay and an
Enasphere in literally the walk up to where you fight the last
boss (so I had to turn around, save, and get it made into Asbel's
best sword.) I beat Lambda in 60 seconds, as well. Nice!

Next, I fought Lambda again on Chaos and used the Cheria piggyback
trick. The key was to get hurt by a ranged attack and beforehand
get rid of his Nova barrier right away with a quick spell.

After doing that, I played for another two hours-ish and got to
the Lastalia Core in the Future arc. In the evening I played for
another 30 minutes and beat the game... killing the Fodra Queen
in 60 seconds (actually 24) on the first try. Nice!

After doing the future arc, my grade is now 3551.

My next goal is the Platinum PSN trophy... the only barriers are
titles for the men and a 9999 mixer... which all seem pretty
painful to get. I'm going to look into the details tomorrow and
decide if I will do it. I'll also look up my battle stats for the
New Game+, I think that will be interesting.

got any yet, which is definitely disappointing. I'm using all the
men (plus Cheria) in my group to try to get their titles. It's

basically can never get hurt or it will always be a one-hit

the stuff I wanted to. I played through Floor 10 of Zhonecage two
more times and got the Darkened Ore and then I finished the Katz
Korner Inn Requests and fought the Gentleman. He was a bit of a
let down as the last boss I fought, because he was so easy. 

Before I closed out my save, I backed it up and then sold
everything to max out my stamps (although I wasn't able to get
all 10 everywhere.) I bought some pretty good stuff in the Grade
Shop for New Game+. Here were my stats for the game:

Asbel's Level: 113
Encounters: 2028
Max Combo: 278
Enemies Seen: 99.3%
Items Seen: 96.5%
Skits: 82.3%
Battle Time: 23:47
Grade: 3119

I think it is interesting that while I played for about 107 hours,
I was only in battle for about 24 of those, or about 22% of the
game time. My average battle length was 42 seconds, which is
interesting given that I had some pretty long battles too.

I immediately started a new game and played for an hour and a
half. I have been doing most of it on Chaos difficulty, but at
this point where I can't bring people back to life, it is very
difficult with the 10x damage and 2x critical, so I dropped it to
Evil for a bit. After an hour a half, I got to Level 28 and am
just before getting Richard back as adults... which is crazy. I'm
obviously skipping every scene, I know exactly where to go, and I
have 2x movement speed.

Game 2: 1:26 @ 20:42 - Level 28
10x damage is /really/ hard on Chaos and pretty hard on Evil

I completed Zhonecage and did almost all the Inn requests by
grinding shards in Zhonecage. The only things left are to do that
last Katz Korner requests, fight the Gentlemen, then fight Lambda
Theos. I checked and my grade is now 2907. I just need a little
bit more so I can get the best carry-overs. Some carry-overs don't
seem very useful, such as half of my money or the battle items,
because with so much more gald per battle, I don't think I'll
really need it. Plus I only have about 300k in the bank because of
dualizing. (Although perhaps the best thing to do is sell
everything before you New Game+?)

In the evening I played for another hour and a half-ish. I beat
Lambda Theos and got a few more of the Katz requests. I tried
Zhonecage 10 again so I could get the Darkened Ore and didn't get
it. Very frustrating. I'm nearing the end.

more attempts to gather stuff in the process of dualizing for

did Moderate and Evil. I haven't done the 60 seconds or the Chaos
difficulty though. I'm not confident I can. Also, I decided to
check my grade: 2719. I can get basically everything except
Skills and x3 SP.

In the afternoon, I played for about an hour and decided to try
and farm shards in Zhonecage for the kinds of shards I needed for
the inn requests. This was very successful.


In the evening, I continued that for about an hour.  I think there
are only two or three more requests I need to do. I also think
there's just one more upgrade before I can hit floor 10.

dualize Malik's final weapon (because I don't normally use him

worth enough.

Using that plan today, I got the spheres for everyone but Asbel
and got the Purebright Cloth. The amount of stuff I need from
Zhonecage is much smaller now... although I will need to fight the
Dark Turtlez more to get the Turtlez Togz. I was able to do Level
9, but its not enough to get to level 10. Painful.

I then made a list of all the various items I hadn't yet collected
so I could begin getting them. This required, among other things,
going back to World's Eye to get some more Legendary Metal, which
was very painful. But I tricked the game by Saving &amp; Loading to
get the Discovery to regenerate.

I took a break for a while and played again in the evening for an
hour and a half. I went to Zhonecage and beat levels 1, 2,

then Chaos for the others (but I should have just done Evil, since
I want the Spheres.) This means I've got to do those levels again
if I want them. Bummer.

For the first thing, I
beat Poisson, using basically the same technique as last time,
but she didn't get to use her Mystic Artes on me, so I won.

During the session there were a lot of cute skits. There was a
great one of Hubert complaining about how scandalous Richard's
final battle costume was; one where Cheria thought she was too fat
and broke the elevator because she had a sweet potato; one where
Lambda tells Pascal to figure something out herself and then ruins
her discovery by revealing it at the last moment. It's great
stuff. :) An odd thing I noticed today in a lot of the scenes was
that Lords, Kings, Leaders, etc all have lots of paperwork to do
and it defines their life. I think game was made in Japan. :)

I did the final dungeon and final battle. The very last area was
very beautiful and the last battle was pretty insane. I loved the
whole counter thing, although I'm not sure how you'd know to do
it.

The ending is nice. I think Sophie's new getup looks
awesome... too bad it doesn't unlock a title so you can have her
like that all the time. I also thought the resolution of the
various romances was sweet.

I loaded up New Game+ to see what my grade was: 1774. I think I
can do a little bit more dualizing, plus some of the EX Dungeon
to get it higher. I intend to do that. Unfortunately, I missed
some skits and side-quests early on, so I can't possibly get
those 100%. Grr.

I am
really enjoying all the skits about Hubert and Pascal. It is very
cute. I especially like how dense Asbel and Pascal are about it.

I like the resolution of the Asbel/Sophie plot and I'm glad it's
not romantic. It's pretty adorable though.

Later in the morning I played for about two hours and got through
the confusing garden and fought the Little Queen. What a strange
character.

--

In the evening I played for about two hours and went through the
post-Little Queen sequence. I liked going around having Lambda
talk to everyone. The voice actor sounds like someone from Metal
Gear, but I can't place who.

I loved the skit with Pascal singing. It was so ridiculous.

I tried to do the Master Class Riot Peak trial, but died at
Poisson at the end... when she was almost dead and she was doing a
Mystic Arts. I'm not sure if I got the prizes, because there was
no mention of anything afterwards, unlike usual. I think I will
try again and go into Accel mode when she has a break.

of little breaks. I basically just did the last dungeon, but I
popped out once to do a few more requests and side quests.

I found it really interesting during the final moments of the game
to learn more about Lambda and how he was created and lived.

The side quest with the sick girl and the dolls was very cute and
had a nice twist in its ending. I also liked how one of the dolls
was the Prince from Katamari.

Two of my favourite skits so far were: when Asbel asks Pascal how
she got from the Amarcian Enclave to where the group was. Her
explanation was ridiculous. The other was when Pascal says that
Cheria is "chubbing out" and then her reaction to that comment.

I picked a fun set of costumes for my characters by the end of the
game: Sophie's pirate outfit, Cheria's new dress, Pascal's
swimsuit, Asbel's black outfit, and the two 'modern' outfits for
Malik and Hubert. I think they're all the best ones.

The last boss was very hard. I tried first on Chaos and got him to
half his health before running out of Elixirs and being
decimated. I next tried Evil and almost won but it was pretty
rough, so I decided when I tried again I'd do Hard. I did it that
time and got the Hard trophy (but not the Moderate
one... annoying.) A key I discovered was using the Hourglass
after his Mystic Artes had killed so many characters.

The ending was pretty intense and had a surprising resolution.

All together, it took my 68 hours and 18 minutes to get to the
"end" of the game. Of course, there's the Lineage &amp; Legacies
expansion, so I'm doing that too and will consider that to be the
actual end of the game.

It's pretty cool so far. My favourite skits have been the ones
about marriage. It's so cute that all of Asbel's proposals remind
him of Cheria and Cheria's crazy dream about their wedding day.

I don't yet understand the Accel system and I'm surprised that any
of the other characters would be able to use it given the story
explanation for its existence.

I really enjoyed how positive and cool
all the people were, as opposed to some of the depressing people
in the other gaming movies I've seen.

I really enjoyed the diversity of the different players and I
think it speaks to how much of a phenomenon Tetris is that there
are players for so many different backgrounds.

I was very impressed and happy that Thor was actually still a
skilled Tetris player and not just posturing.

It blew my mind when they talked about the Invisible Tetris mode
and the kid's ability to last for a minute. That's insane.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
