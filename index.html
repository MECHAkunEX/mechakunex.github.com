Afghanistan and worked on my bond with Quiet. I started buying her
new stuff and did lots of building for my helicopter. I also
managed to get enough Fuel to add a base expansion. I have enough
Fuel that is unprocessed to do more. Of course, once I got into
the ACC, a whole new list of Afghan side-ops opened, included some
rehashes of earlier wants. I want to figure out if I can get rid
of them forever or if there is an advantage to just continuing to
do them over and over. I'm going to take a break from Afghanistan
and do a mission or two in Africa and all the missions there.

Afghanistan. My main goal was to work on getting Quiet's bond
level up, so I just kept having her shoot guys. I learned how to
use the iDroid to tell her where to go and what mode to be in,
which has made things a lot better. I eventually unlocked the
tranquilizer gun, which is very fun. The AI is reacting really
poorly to her, because they often cannot get to her but they try
to, so the guards are just wiggling against the edge of cliff
hopelessly. It makes it really easy to sneak up on them and grab
them.

I went to the Base Camp and had a great time gathering all the
containers there. On the way, I took out some heavy infantry,
which was funny to fight with Quiet using the Tranq gun, because
it just bounces off their helmets. She managed to shoot one as it
was coming down from a lookout post, so he fell down and got
stunned.

I'm butting up against not having enough fuel to do more base
building. Actually, I have the fuel, but it is not being processed
fast enough so I can't actually use it, which is definitely very
annoying.

I have to admit that it is a bit embarrassing playing the game
when Quiet is on the screen because she is so unnecessarily
sexualized. Luckily that's only during the helicopter sequences.

totally emptied the facility of people before blowing up
anything. The mission where I got there Afrikaans interpreter was
awesome because I immediately tranq'd everyone and grabbed them
before they could start walking the prisoner away or anything.

After that, I got Quiet and did a few Side-Ops. I don't normally
kill, but I used her to kill lots of fools to try to get her bond
rating up, so I can get the weapons I want with her. I don't feel
like I'm doing it right and I can't get her to follow me. I walked
off into the wilderness and she didn't come at all. Perhaps it's
because of the bond rating. I thought again a lot about how much I
love using the Fulton to get vehicles and containers.

I haven't done Mission 10 yet, so I don't have the transport

The mission is very fun and I'm still working on it. I did a good
job getting almost everyone out, but then I got a bit cocky and
attacked a group of four from behind and, although I got a few of
them, I was spotted from the other side by a sniper that got me.

When I restarted, I couldn't get the Walkers in the same way I did
the first time. I also had the unpleasant experience of coming out
of the big building in the middle, only to be locked out and
spotted by the sniper. I ran away and was fine. I don't expect to
be interested in using the Walker that I will get, it just doesn't
seem to fit my style.

This game is so amazing, I love it.

destroy the armored vehicles. I only missed one of them, but I did
miss the prisoner in the van and I didn't get to the prisoner in
the wilderness. It was pretty exciting and fun.

After that mission, I got D-Dog which was pretty
cool. Unfortunately, the next mission I did was going to get
Emmerich. The problem was that I landed the helicopter right over
an armored vehicle, so they shot down the helicopter. I managed to
grab everyone and get through, but it cost a lot of money.

I worked my way up towards the power plant and got into the battle
with Quiet. I shot her with a tranquilizer sniper rifle I had just
developed. I wanted to sneak up on her, but I found it very
difficult, even with D-Dog helping to sniff her out.

I can't believe Miller is such a jerk about her. I suppose it is
based on Huey and Miller's other trust issues. Quiet's opening
scene in the helicopter was definitely pretty cool. I went to
visit her and it was awesome that "Snake Eater" started playing. I
couldn't get Quiet to react to me at all though, I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do with her to recruit her.

admit though, that I found walking around pretty boring and the
particular combat to be a bit boring and mashy. I presume this is
because they wanted to quickly introduce the concept to people
that had never seen it before and have a short demo rather than
the game which will actually ramp up the difficulty and train the
play to use the system well.

first I did one, then one, then two, which was annoying to keep

away. I plan on going back and doing the missions again once I can
Fulton larger things. I did a few other side-ops and took over
some bases. Annoyingly, I died on two of those with only two
enemies left. In the first case, they got me because I thought I
was covered after they same me and I blew up. On the other, I
accidentally jump out of a guard tower and fell to my death
because I thought I would land on the outpost wall. Dumb, and
totally my fault, but very annoying that the checkpoint put me
back before I had done anything at all to the base. This game is
so much fun. My only complaint is that it is a bit annoying to
travel around the map when my side-ops are all over the place.
