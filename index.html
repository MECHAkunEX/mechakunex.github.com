Stage 40 --- I actually beat it the first time I got to the
Longai-O today. It took me a long time to get there though.

properly and finishing the second to last spawn fast.

I played 42 for a while, but couldn't get past the first Longai-O,
because I use my Dash too much on the enemies next to it.

Later in the day I played for another two-ish hours. I got to a
lot of tragedy in Asbel's life. I think they really sold his
change of personality and it is interesting too. I'm curious to
see what will happen. It's a little strange for him to go from one
trope to another though... first he's annoying brash anime
character and now he's annoying somber anime character.

The battles after he grows up are a lot more difficult and
interesting, too.

I spent the first 30-ish
minutes trying to do Stage 35 and then gave up for a bit and
tried Stage 36. When that was still hard, I went back to Stage 35
and beat it. (Along with getting two achievements.)

Stage 35 --- I eventually won by using the Napalm and doing a
Dash-to-Freeze pattern over and over against Longai-O. The giant
guy was easy once I got behind him and I did the final room in
one try.

Stage 36 --- This seems impossible. I was able to race back on one
of the times I tried, but didn't kill everything, which is when I
learned I had to.

This game is getting to the point where it is so hard that I feel
like it hard to play for more than an hour or so at a time
because I'm just doing the same level over and over again. I
still love it... it's just stressful.

----

Later in the day, I did another hour.

Stage 36 --- I eventually did this and the key was getting a lot
of practice and learning to conserve my counters well. After a few
tries, I did it.

Stage 37 --- This was a totally insane level full of
Dash-and-Counter forever. I'm amazed that this was in the
tutorial.

Stage 38 --- This level had a totally obscene amount of bullets
and it was totally insane when it first started, because I had no
idea what was going to happen. Eventually it was pretty easy once
I made a point of taking out the batters on the right first.

Stage 39 --- This was a challenging and fun level. The key was to
dash along the force fields and then counter every few segments
to kill the ones of the top. I wasn't totally perfect... I missed
a few things a few times, so I had to backtrack a little bit. It
made it so I had only 15 seconds to spare when I won.

Stage 40 --- This is a really tough level because each phase is
so different. I got to the two Longai-O once, but have a very
hard time freezing them in general, so I failed. I can reasonably
reliably get past the first stage, but the ants really get me.

overwhelming.) The introductory movie was cute and the game has a
cute setting so far. I've just been walking around and getting a
glimpse of the battle system (in the form of tips after every
battle.) I'll probably do an hour of this and an hour of another
game for a bit. It's pretty funny to me the sharp contrast between
this and Bangai-O... this is so ridiculously slow compared to it.

----

In the evening, I played again for about twenty minutes. I just
did scenes and met Asbel's father. I thought the reaction from
Cheria about what the plan for Sophie would be was hilarious. The
characters and interactions in this game are already really
enjoyable even after a short time.

Mechanically, I got two more titles and I think I will have to max
out each one because I'm crazy.

Stage 34 --- This stage was fairly difficult, because it is quite
a bit different than normal levels. I was able to finish it by
shooting missiles while pushing the blocks to destroy the turrets
and charge up another Counter for when both blocks are in
place. Then it was just a matter of kiting a little.

Stage 35 --- This stage is ridiculously hard. I haven't beat it
yet and I played it for over an hour. It took a long time to get
to the big bosses at the end, but I haven't been able to get them
yet. When I watched a video of someone beating it... it seems so
easy but I can't seem to do it. I'll have to try something else.

Stage 32 --- This was a frustrating level... not really that hard,
but it was very difficult to control your fire, since the rest of
the game is designed around shooting tons and tons of bullets. In
this level, the ceiling can collapse if you touch it, blocking you
in from the rest of the level. You have to be very controlled in
your fighting. It was definitely interesting though.

Stage 33 --- This was a very fun "arena"-style level with three
phases of enemies. First, there's a maze of hedgehogs and their
generators. Then, a bunch of spinning things appear with some
support. (A few ninjas too!) Finally, a bunch of Napalm-shooting
tanks and Longai-O (?) appear. It was very challenging to deal
with everything, although I'd say the first and last phase were
the hardest. But, you got so much practice with the first one, it
felt easy at the end.

It was
interesting because it had three phases and each needed a bit of
finesse to solve. In the first phase, you had to Dash into enemies
to make them vulnerable, but it was okay deal with them all
together. In the second, you had to try to focus on one enemy but
make sure you blew up their missiles before they got to you. In
the final one, you had to Dash into things to make the vulnerable
and then use a focused Counter. The last phase was the hardest to
do.

-----

In the afternoon, I played again for a little more than an hour. I
did two stages.

Stage 21 --- This was interesting, because it was very easy in the
beginning, but very difficult right at the end. Stages like that
are kind of annoying, because the amount of time you need to spend
to repeat the part you are good at is so long. But it was
interesting to learn the skill of freezing tons of bullets.

Stage 22 --- This one took the majority of the time. I really like
these long levels that aren't as puzzle-y and require you to do a
lot of stuff pretty fast. It took me a long time to be able to
reliably get the end and even longer to defeat the final
enemy. Even though I got a very good score and time, my time would
have been a lot better, because I accidentally missed a single
enemy in the first room and had to go back. I think tonight I will
go back and beat it faster.

----

In the evening, I played for about three hours.

Stage 22 --- I did this stage again to improve my time and it took
two tries, but I ended up with #24 in ze world!

Stage 23 --- This was a really weird level that took me quite a
bit to get the hang over. I eventually started spamming Counters
at the top and bottom to eliminate the targets up there, then
carefully destroy the giant enemies one by one afterwards.

Stage 24 --- This was a super challenging one because there were
so few capabilities. I took it extremely slowly and just bounced
the enemies back towards the end and progressed from there.

Stage 25 --- This was a baffling level to start. These really
puzzle-ly levels are hard to grasp. Eventually I got the hang of
it and felt forced to go really fast. It turns out that the
pressure made become #5 in ze world (for time) on this level! Nice

Stage 26 --- This was a crazy, beautiful level. I love the irony
in the hint. I used the standard Dash-Counter-Dash-Counter-repeat
technique. It is exhilarating to do levels like this... the
explosions are so satisfying.

Stage 27 --- This was really interesting. They are getting super
creative with the chained bombs. It took me a long time to master
the final way of enemies that launched the Napalm bombs. The
beginning was tough too... but the cycle is so fast, I got used to
it quickly.

Stage 28 --- This was challenging. There are a lot of one-hit kill
enemies that really got under me. The worst thing happened during
this... the first time I got to the end, I wasn't able to make it
to the final target before it was sealed off, so I had to do it
again, and of course didn't do it perfectly again for a bit. :(

Stage 29 --- Hah! This stealth missions was brilliant. After
getting to the end, it was so satisfying to smash through
everything. I watched the video of the top time person and their
technique is absurd.

Stage 30 --- I initially found this one almost impossible. It's
fitting that it is the stage with the least number of completions
on the leaderboards out of the ones I've done. After getting a
time of almost 2'45", I decided to watch a master and see what the
time technique was. The #1 beat it in 0'13". I had to try their
technique. Over the next hour or so, I gradually improved. My
first big leap was to 1'40", then I got to 1'20", then 0'40", then
finally to 0'20". It was beautiful. I got #7 in the world for
time! Nice!

Stage 31 --- This was a super challenging level and ridiculously
over-the-top in the explosions department. In my winning run, I
destroy the top before the bottom by delaying the lighting of the
fuses. It seemed like a good idea and only lost a bit of time by
having to go back to the far right to kill some enemies I missed.

-----

I can't believe how good this game is. Seriously.

I spent about ten minutes
on stage 8---where there's just a single big Ant and then a ton
more spawn. It was very reminiscent of the first level, where you
have to get the counter attack timing just right. Eventually I
realized I needed to move around to stay a head of the enemies,
then it wasn't hard.

Stage 9, I still haven't beat. It's very difficult because it's
so long and I seem to run out of resources very quickly. It feels
like you can't really dodge in this game, so you need to use
other things to avoid taking damage---bursting at the right time,
countering at the right time, pointing your shots at the enemy's,
etc. I was able to get to about 75% through, with close to full
health, but I think I needed a counter and didn't have one.

I don't like the idea of skipping ahead to other levels (even
though it lets you), because I'm worried that I'll forget which
levels I did and didn't do. (I guess I could just keep track of
that here.)

-----

Later in the day, I played for 35 minutes and beat Stage 9. It
was really intense, but I learned to properly harness my moments
of invulnerability effectively enough to do it. In my
second-to-last run, I forgot the two targets in the massive
swarms of robots, but had gone past the point of no return, so I
couldn't go back and get them. In my winning run, there were a
few moments where one more hit would've killed me. This game is
so exhausting.

-----

In the evening, after my kids were asleep, I played for another
2:20. I got to Stage 20.

Stage 10 --- Very confusing. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to
do, but after running down the clock, I decided I was supposed to
wait for something. Once I did that it got too furious and I did
a massive counter and won. I guess you are supposed to kill them
all at once?

Stage 11 --- This was a fun, long level. I think it was the first
that took away Dash attacks... which is recurring thing in the
game. I found it difficult until I realized I should use more
Counters.

Stage 12 --- This was a really short level that didn't take very
long to do, but it was very enjoyable. I like the idea of a
falling trap and I was able to use a single massive counter to
get almost everything.

Stage 13 --- This was the first soccer ball map. It's insane and
I loved it. It took me just a few tries.

Stage 14 --- This one was really, really hard. It seemed really
easy at first, but then I'd die out of nowhere. I realized that it
was the Ninjas I was warned about in the hint. Once I knew that
they were there, it was clear the key was to never be
vulnerable. I went back and forth between Dash-ing and
Counter-ing, until all the Ninjas were destroyed. Then, I just
needed to corral the other enemies against the corners to blast
'em. Sweet.

Stage 15 --- This was tough. It took me maybe ten tries before I
was able to get past the first Target. Then, it was tough to get
to the next one. I decided to Dash burst the majority of the way,
then hang out where it was safe and clear a path through the
turrets. I cleared the rest of the level after that realization.

Stage 16 --- This was a super tough level. The hint is like the
one from 14... it sounds obvious and ridiculous, but it's the key
to winning. I nudged myself into the corners and got them before
going out. Intense.

Stage 17 --- This one was infuriating. After about maybe 15
minutes, I got to the end but realized I had forgotten to blow
the trail of bombs to get past. The next time I got to the end, I
had forgotten to kill one enemy, so I couldn't get through. The
next time, I didn't have much time, so it was hopeless to
discover what I was supposed to do against the boss. The next
time, I tried to use a concentrated Bounce Counter (in fact, ten
in a row), but they weren't enough to hurt the target. (I thought
I should use the Bounce because in my brief time before, I
couldn't aim a Homing shot in.) Then, I watched a video and the
person just used a Concentrated Homing shot. I did that and
one. It was super frustrating because the level is so long and I
just needed to vary what happened at the end. In addition, I had
a few failures into each one.

Stage 18 --- This was a very challenging level. The lack of Dash
seemed like a real killer because there's just so much stuff going
on, but once I got a grove in, I was able to go forward for just
the right amount of time and Counter all the way to the end.

Stage 19 --- This was a pretty challenging level. There were many
of the hardest kinds of enemies. The first time I got to the end
(i.e. the middle), the big blue guy in the middle killed me
because I tried a Bounce Counter. Next time I got him with the
Napalm, but I had forgotten one Target and had to go back. By the
time I got back to the middle, I had only 30 seconds. It took me a
few more times to get back to the middle again, and then I used
Dash and the concentrated Bounce Counter to get to the end. A very
satisfying level.

-----

This game is so amazing. It's so tough but so satisfying to beat
every level. Every level feels so different and like it's almost a
different game. Amazing.

I've tried to play a Bangai-O game before (the DS one), but I
didn't give it enough of a chance to convince me (so I don't have
a reasonable opinion of it); but, in any case, I was a bit nervous
about this. Given that I spent some money on though, I figured it
would be a nice way to force me to understand it... given that
I've heard so many good things about the Bangai games before, and
I love Treasure.

This game is insanely overwhelming, visually and
mechanically. There's a 29-page in-game manual, which frightened
me away from reading it. Then in front of each of level is an
overwhelming set of advice, which I haven't yet been able to
understand deeply enough to apply.

The first few levels were very fun and challenging. The next set
escalated the difficulty a lot---particularly the level where you
fought Longai-O and the Ant level.

When I play the game, I immediately feel a sense of time dilation,
where everything seems to be going really slow and I can focus on
little things on a purely intuitive basis. Even though a level may
only last two minutes, it feels like it lasts a lot longer because
of the number of decisions I'm making. Yet, at the same time, I
feel like I'm not really making conscious choices, but am just
reacting at a reptilian level to what's going on. It's bizarre.

I tried to explain the game to my wife a bit, who was overwhelmed
as I expected, but she was able to appreciate my replay of the Ant
level. Moreover, she was able to immediately see the amazing skill
of the number one in world (for time) on that same level.

I get the feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun with this game!

In the
last part of the game, I stopped balancing my classes and just
focused on a strategy that I knew could win. My strategy was so
effective, I was able to defeat the final boss in a single hit
after a few rounds of preparation.

Overall, I found the game okay. The combat was too easy, but a
little bit stressful to not be totally boring. (I never died
during the whole game.) The writing was very funny in the
beginning, but got increasingly crazy and out-of-whack. I like
the weirdness, but I didn't really like it when it was trying to
be "dark" or "edgy".

I tried to do the Prologue, but (a) I was annoyed that I had to
go back to level 1, (b) I didn't know anything about the previous
games, and (c) the non-sense story had gotten on my nerves.

The game is definitely worth the price!

to be able to spend it without worrying too much about what I am
saving for, etc. I decided to order a game on Amazon and then
download one to play right away. I'd heard an interview about
this game and it sounded very cute.

I played for two chunks of an hour and a half. Right away the
writing was hilarious and made me want to read every little thing
and look at the text on all the monsters.

When I started playing, I like the 16-bit art-style the game has
and the mechanics are pretty nice. The movement feels a bit
sloppy with the Xbox's analog stick, though.

The game is incredibly streamlined, despite its style. I was very
surprised with the graph-based overworld rather than a map that
you actually walk around on. It makes the linearity of the story
very much in your face. Now, that linearity is not terrible, given
how much I liked games like Final Fantasy that just have the
illusion of options. But, in this there really can't be any
options because no paths can be hidden from you. It's a bit
underwhelming, even though it is nice to not have to walk.

The lack of random battles was surprising as well and it appears
that there are simply a fixed number of battles in the game,
because when you leave an area then go back, all the enemies you
defeated are still gone. It's kind of surprising and it makes me
nervous as a grinding/completion-ist oriented person.

The battle system itself is pretty neat. The idea that you store
up MP per round and then unleash it all at once places something
that it is a fairly common, but rarely used, mechanic in other
games (like Tension in Dragon Quest or Cyan's Special Attack in
FF6) as the defining thing. At least you don't give up your turn
and can still attack or use a 0 MP spell. Nevertheless, I almost
always use 1 or 2 MP spells.

Similarly, the item system is really odd. Items are like the
skills in FF13: they can only effectively be used a finite number
of times per battle. But, they can be used every battle without
effort and they are improved via a technology-research-like
system. It's odd.

I like the way the battle order is resolved... how you have to
decide your moves slightly in advance of what other characters
will do. It's just enough active to be interesting.

I think it is odd that you always know how much HP the enemies
have. It seems wrong to have so much information.

As interesting as the system is, I've never lost a battle or felt
very worried about any particular outcome. The battles are
definitely interesting, but I can generally ace them. I hope they
stretch me a bit more eventually.

Given how quickly you lose a party member, it makes me extremely
nervous about giving resources (particularly buying weapons for)
the non-main characters. I wish they would telegraph a little
more that a character will be permanent. (I've decided that if
they have all four weapon upgrades, they must be.)

The class system is very funny, but I haven't found a lot of use
for the various classes. There are few that I find myself really
using---like healing ones, but generally I ignore them except to
level them evenly. I think it is funny that Tycho can be a
Gentleman AND a Scholar.

I quite like the game and will continue playing it, of course.

I'd never really played it
before and I just assumed it was exactly the same as Tetris. But
it's much more complex and incredibly challenging.

I got to Level 8 with a score of 30,600.

During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense
pressure. The game board is so claustrophobic and you feel like
no decision is the right one. It's so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.

My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She's amazing!
