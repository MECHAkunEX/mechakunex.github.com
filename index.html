I had
some fun boss fights. I was able to beat Othros in two rounds: the
first using Invigorate and then using Hidden Dragon. I used almost
the same strategy against the Summoner but because I knew the
fight was coming, I turned everyone into Monks and beat her in a
single round using just Hidden Dragons. 

On the other hand, when I fought the Time Mage &amp; Sword Fencer and
Ranger, I didn't see the fight coming so I fought them with really
weak and weird jobs, like a Freelancer, Merchant, Thief, and Time
Mage.

I'm trying to get Level 9 on most of jobs. I did, however, just
decide to get Level 10 on Freelancer so I can get the JP%
increase.

Also, since I got the Summoner job, I need to go back to the Wind
Temple, where I noticed the Summoner guy. I'm currently partly
through Mt. Fragmentum.

I really enjoy the game still, but am definitely overpowered from
playing at 200% Encounter Rate. For instance, when I switched to
Chapter 2, everyone was level 36 and I had two jobs each at level
9, plus one other job at level 6.

Something I really like about the game, but am surprised about, is
that when you beat the job enemies they really die. It's intense.

my first try with a Magic guard. I used 3 X-Potions, 2 Phoenix
Downs, and 1 Arise. It was pretty intense.

I really liked the ending. It was very nice to remember the whole
game and I like the final moments. The extra scene at the end of
the credits was cool too.

I turned on the New Game+ on Hard for a little bit just to see how
things worked. I feel like I won't like doing every Side Quest
again because it is so "busy" but I will like fighting again. I
think the biggest thing I'm worried about is that it will take a
lot of time to get the materials to get the upgrade trophies. I
found that skipping the cut-scenes was a little annoying and slow.

games like Demon's Souls about. Furthermore, they were ignoring
the instructions the game said then running around in circles

frustrating to listen to them.

I played today for about three hours. I basically did nothing
(slept for 14 hours and then 18 hours) on the 12th and 13th days,
because I had nothing to do. On the 13th day, I did the Ultimate
Lair, but only had two enemies to kill. It took about three tries
with different techniques to kill Ereshigal. It was pretty cool. I
got 5 stars in 4'22" but died three times (two Phoenix Downs and
one Arise). It was cool.

When I got to the final Outfitters, I couldn't buy every garb, so
I did some grinding on the Anubys to get the Nightmare garb. I got
80k gil and then pushed forward. I'll probably beat the game
today.
