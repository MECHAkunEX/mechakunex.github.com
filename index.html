  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight. I have a few thoughts
about my experiences tonight&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The controls are really annoying. It is very weird that A is
the confirm button on the Wii Pro controller, because it is in
the cancel spot. There should have been a way to change.</p></li>
<li><p>The user interface is really painful. There&#8217;s a big loading
time to do everything. The equipment management system is
really annoying&#8212;you can&#8217;t equip from a shop and when you
change equipment, the gems don&#8217;t automatically get unequipped
and I haven&#8217;t found a way to remove them other than putting the
thing back on and removing it from there. It&#8217;s really
painful. The quick travel system is really slow too because you
have to go so deep in the menus.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m amazed that the killed off what seemed like a main
character after giving you the opportunity to spend /a lot/ of
money on her to give a special bikini outfit. I didn&#8217;t realize
it would be a wasted expense.</p></li>
<li><p>The graphics are quite good for some Wii games, but feel really
bad in other ways. I think this is most noticeable when they
show faces, because they are totally flat. The environments are
really beautifully constructed and I love how open they are.</p></li>
<li><p>The combat system is pretty interesting. I still don&#8217;t feel
like I totally understand all my choices, but I have a bit of a
technique worked out that is being useful so far.</p></li>
<li><p>The story is pretty compelling and the world is very bizarre
and fascinating for it.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t really know anything about this movie before watching it,
but heard it was interesting. It was really cool. It was so
nostalgic of what life was like for me when I was young&#8230; going
to shows all night, etc. That was really cool about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had this game on my &#8220;Queue&#8221; since I bought it, but I&#8217;ve had
to admit to myself that I just hate playing games on the iPhone
so much, I&#8217;m definitely not going to sit down and play
this. Sometimes I play it when I&#8217;m waiting for something, but I
have other things that feel more productive that I could be doing
on my phone.</p>

<p>I like the game and I think it is the best iPhone game I&#8217;ve
played, but I really dislike the iPhone interface and this game
in particular feels like it would work just as well with
buttons. I feel like the only way for me to appreciate this game
will be for me to re-implement it myself and give it buttons.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m retiring it from my queue, with a bit of a sad face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started this game tonight. The opening sequence is really cool,
especially after the battle when it pulls out and shows you how
people live on the two giant titans. It&#8217;s such a cool concept.</p>

<p>The battle system I experienced during the walk to the first
village was incredibly reminiscent of FF12, but with a bit more
action on the part of the player. When I got to the town, it was
incredibly tempting to go and find all the glowing blue things
and get all the quests, etc. I can tell that it will be hard to
not make this game a giant collect-a-thon for myself.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the mechanics a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of
different options about how to equip characters, so many quests,
so many different ways to buy things. It&#8217;s very intimidating. I
think I will do the obvious thing until it hurts me rather than
trying to compute what the best solution will be.</p>

<p>I was amazed at how many different quests I unlocked so early,
though.</p>

<p>The voice acting in this game is actually really good. I almost
never like non-Japanese voice acting, because it is normally just
so horrendous. (Actually, now that I think about, Asura&#8217;s Wrath
was pretty good.) Since the actors in this game are British,
there&#8217;s something really fun and exotic about them. I like it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited to be playing this game. (One annoyance: I&#8217;m
using the Wii Pro controller. I hate having to have it plugged in
to the Wiimote that sits stupidly next to me on the couch.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this afternoon for like an hour. I got up to Bald
Bull. During the fight with Soda Popinski that I won, I was in the
second round and had him down twice and he got me down for the
second time&#8230; I considered restarting, but didn&#8217;t and won. Woot!</p>

<p>Later in the day I played for a bit more and got to
Mr. Sandman. He&#8217;s really really hard. I&#8217;ve decided to put this as
&#8220;Scheduled&#8221; game and play it weekly until I beat him, rather than
burning a lot of time all at once.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kind of appalled that I was able to get to the end so
quickly, but I know it will take a while to beat Sandman and
online I read that there is another round of fighting every enemy
during Title Defense. So it will be a fun experience, but not
really something you can binge on too much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he&#8217;d be weak, but he wasn&#8217;t), then we went to Sting
Chameleon&#8217;s stage and got the Armor upgrade. I&#8217;m not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te&#8212;-dious!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we played for an hour and a half-ish. We beat the game! The
final boss and the last rocket sequence was pretty tough and my
wife was getting very frustrated, but we eventually did it.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Channel clocks our total time at 20 hours and 52
minutes (I haven&#8217;t been keeping track of our game play that long.)</p>

<p>We decided that the game is a lot more sloppy in many ways
compared to NSMBW, but that we had a lot of fun, especially once
we got infinite lives. We don&#8217;t love the game enough to try to get
all the bonuses to unlock the hidden temple, so that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>I like platformers, but I like playing games with my wife more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in May, I bought a copy of S&amp;P for the N64 in Japan. On
Tuesday I bought a US N64 to play it on. Today, I got the
&#8220;GameBit&#8221; in the mail that I needed to region mod it to play
Japanese N64 games.</p>

<p>I started playing S&amp;P and it took a while to get used to the
controls again&#8230; especially because before I played on my arcade
stick (under an emulator) and now I was using the actual control
scheme. It felt a little strange but I started to get used to it
quickly.</p>

<p>I played about 14 minutes and got: 5,343,930 pts, 11m13s, and 531
enemies. I died at the final stage of the final boss of the first
level. I remember it taking a while to realize that I had to
shoot the glowing spot under water the first time too&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this in the morning and got to Great Tiger. I had a
tough time with Bear Hugger before I realized that I could duck
the Bear Hug. I only fought one round against Great Tiger, so I&#8217;m
just learning his patterns. It is interesting how this game is
almost, but not quite, identical to the NES version. There are
some things that are better and more convenient (like Saves and
Retry in the middle of a match) but other than that it&#8217;s just
tweaked on the edges. It&#8217;s cool.</p>

the boss, but died on the first time and were out of lives. He
wanted to play Launch Octopus again so we did that had a tough
time with the ships before it was time for breakfast.</p>
