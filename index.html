interesting for the way it gets the characters to talk to each

such a less effect on me and the lack of gore is great. I think
the gameplay is pretty bad and feels really sloppy. The characters
have really unrealistic defenses, but very realistic offenses,
which just makes it seem like it's a badly programmed action
game. I'm enjoying it enough though, especially when I manage to
sneak through an area. I feel like I'm not getting enough things
to improve my equipment and stats given how long I expect the game
to be.

better today. I think the big thing was that I used lots of

The first night I wandered around
and got in some fights with a big herd of Garula (I think). I got
pretty battered up and was surrounded by lots of things when I was
trying to get back to the camp site. After that I explored a bit
more and found where the Behemoth was, but couldn't get to it and
needed to go around to the other side, which was kind of annoying
and made me feel like something was broken. I tried to use the
Navigation menu to teleport to the rest site, but the game
crashed.

The audio and visuals for the game are really great. The monsters
all look amazing, as do the heroes. I can tell that I am going to
be super impressed with the visuals when I play the full game.

I'm not feeling as hot about the combat system. It felt very
button-mashy and that it didn't have good enough "tells" for
knowing when you should dodge, so I felt like I just had to absorb
hits and deal with it. I like the idea of the action system, but I
haven't learned it enough to know if it will really be fun or just
grindy. I loved the FF13 series battle system so much that it will
be hard to love another one, I think. I'm worried that it won't be
as strategic as the others. Of course, I will try though.

I like that you have to go to the camp site to actually receive
your EXP and I like the concept of the meal you cook giving you a
status effect for the whole day. It's a fun idea that reminds me
of Muramasa. It was funny, however, just barely getting to the
camp site with a ton of enemies on my tail and them just
disappearing as I peacefully go to sleep. At least the camp site
looked magically glowing in some way, like the old games.
