played on the highest difficulty allowed when you start. I'd like
to keep going, but I feel like it is really inconvenient, because
I don't want my kids to be around (because of all the violence and
language and butt rock in the game.) I think I will do it
though. The big question is whether I play old school games on the
down time or start my other PS3 game I have.

The final bosses were pretty interesting, although I found Vergil
to not be very difficult once you realized you had to beat him in
Devil mode. I also thought that Mundus wasn't that hard to dodge,
but he did so much damage you could only take a few hits before
going down, which made it feel harder. I think the fight against
the Mundus Spawn was very interesting though.

I was very curious how they were going to have Vergil turn on
you. Given that I've played the other games, I know he's supposed
to be the bad guy, so I was quite surprised at the beginning when
he was kind of your boss.

interesting then any other old horizontal shooter.

each checkpoint, so basically infinite lives). It was pretty
brutal. In Hard, not only do you only start with One Life, but
everything kills you on one hit, so it's like playing a shmup and
doing a 1CC.

I found the general mechanics to be pretty much just okay. Not
terrible, but not spectacular either. However, the "set pieces"
and sequences in the game that were different we really cool. The
"puzzle rooms" in Stage 5 and the forced scrolling chase were
really neat. Stage 6, which was entirely in the shooter style, was
very fun too. It was awesome to take down the ship piece by piece.

It was also cool how even after fighting the final boss, you still
had to dodge and weave as it chased you to Earth. It was a good
tough.

In general, the graphics were some of the best I've seen on the
Genesis and I was genuinely impressed. 

Nevertheless, it feels like a one-off game that I couldn't get a
lot from another time.
