levels. The beginning of this game was pretty fun and unique, but
as the levels get longed, it ceases to be as fun, because it feels
like it just about memorizing a pattern. The "boss" fight is the
worst because you cannot anticipate what the enemy is going to
drop on you and you really need to just straight-up memorize
it. One person on my friends list had played the game and given up
at that point, so I imagine a lot of people get turned off
there. I did the first level of Zone 2 and saw that they added
some mechanics but it felt too painful already, so I didn't go
through it.

A good, but flawed, game.

particularly good compared to best-in-class action RPGs. 

I don't regret spending an hour with the game, but I do regret
spending $5 on it during the Steam sale. I think the subject

strong enough to support the bland mechanics.
