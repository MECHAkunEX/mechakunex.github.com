top-down stages were neat.

On one level, this game is a lot like a shmup, so you'd think that
I would like it a lot, but I didn't. I think the reason I didn't
was that the character was very hard to maneuver, so you felt like
it wasn't your fault you were dying. When I finally died, I had to
fight a boss while clinging to the side of a wall and it felt very
unfair, like I couldn't do anything about it.

I'm sure if my first console were a SNES, I would have loved this
game as much as I loved Contra I, but this didn't do it for me.

hours. I got up through the Wintry Cave.

I remember playing this game when I was a kid and thinking it was
really strange, for a Final Fantasy game, but fine. As I got
older, I thought back on it as being silly and I recognized what a
bad reputation it had with a lot of people. There's this idea that
it was released in the US instead of FF5 and that's it is very
simple and bland.

I see where those people are coming from, because it is definitely
a lot simpler than what came directly before or directly after,
but I'm finding it very enjoyable.

Although it was very clearly designed as "My First RPG", the
things that they did to streamline it are fine and even good. In
fact, it anticipates changes in later Final Fantasy games. For
example:

- The overworld is not a map that you can walk around on (and get
lost) [or find secrets], instead it is a graph of interconnected
nodes. This is just like FF10. The lack of random battles to get
in is compensated with the "battleground" concept, which gives
you an indication of how much you should be grinding and gives a
nice little reward.

- When you die in battle, you can immediately try again from
where your stats were before the battle started. This is like
FF13. Unfortunately, whereas FF13 used this to make every
battle very challenging (combined with the no meta-game), in
FF:MQ the battles aren't particularly tough. (Although the
status effects are common and brutal.)

- Weapons and armor are automatically equipped and you always use
what is best. Except not exactly, because you can change weapons
really simply with the shoulder buttons. I like this because in
FF4, for instance, there's basically only three situations where
you would ever want to not use the best stuff. (1) When you go
to the Dark Elf cave, (2) when you fight the elements and want
to use the right protections, and (3) when you can't afford the
best for everyone and want to control who gets it. This
streamlining is very nice.

- You can save /anywhere/!

- All enemies are visible.

Another thing about the game I'm enjoying is the light action
elements. I associate them a lot with Lufia II, although this game
predates it. It adds a nice bit of variety and fun.

I find the story to very bland, but passable. It's very similar to
the straight-forward-ness of FF1 or Zelda, but with a few fun
dialogue choices and elements.

The game is very cute and there's a lot more connections and
similarities to Actraiser. It's like you're a different avatar of
"The Master". You move around to different towns to restore. There
was even a kid named Teddy! (That's the name of a kid from
Bloodpool in Actraiser.) I really enjoyed the second area, because
it was a town of animals. In both of the first two areas, you also
go into the dreams of a plant :) It was neat too when an old man
says he's was lonely when his wife died but then got a goat to
take care of; when you talk to the goat, it says it's the wife
reincarnated and even though she can't talk to her husband, she's
glad to be around him. Cute.

The combat is getting a little more complex as there are more
enemies that shoot projectiles, etc. But it's not incredibly
complicated, because the controls are so stiff and tile-based.

bad. Amazingly, it is a 2D platformer with camera problems. When
you die, if you move to the right, then the screen doesn't scroll

time. I've played Illusion of Gaia before and it's a lot like
it. It's a traditional action RPG, but there are something neat
things about it.

In the story/structure, it is very similar to Quintet's Actraiser
(which I just played), in that as you fight monsters, you
"restore" lost parts of the towns and unlock people who were
captive and now tell you about their lives. I've enjoyed the
reveals so far. My favorite was a goat that, after giving you a
hint, said, "I have other things to attend to now", and then
walked off.

In the battle mechanics, it's also like Actraiser in that there
are monster spawn points that release one monster after
another. The difference, though, is that here you just have to
kill a certain number and then the spawn point is sealed. Since
you know where they are going to spawn, there's a temptation to
sit on top of it and spam the attack, but they thought of that and
the enemies are invulnerable when they first appear, but they can
still hurt you. Instead, you have to stand a little bit of a way
back and spam the attack button. =) I haven't gotten to a place
where the combat is tricky, but it does feel good, and that counts
for a lot.

I'll definitely keep playing this.
