The first night I wandered around
and got in some fights with a big herd of Garula (I think). I got
pretty battered up and was surrounded by lots of things when I was
trying to get back to the camp site. After that I explored a bit
more and found where the Behemoth was, but couldn't get to it and
needed to go around to the other side, which was kind of annoying
and made me feel like something was broken. I tried to use the
Navigation menu to teleport to the rest site, but the game
crashed.

The audio and visuals for the game are really great. The monsters
all look amazing, as do the heroes. I can tell that I am going to
be super impressed with the visuals when I play the full game.

I'm not feeling as hot about the combat system. It felt very
button-mashy and that it didn't have good enough "tells" for
knowing when you should dodge, so I felt like I just had to absorb
hits and deal with it. I like the idea of the action system, but I
haven't learned it enough to know if it will really be fun or just
grindy. I loved the FF13 series battle system so much that it will
be hard to love another one, I think. I'm worried that it won't be
as strategic as the others. Of course, I will try though.

I like that you have to go to the camp site to actually receive
your EXP and I like the concept of the meal you cook giving you a
status effect for the whole day. It's a fun idea that reminds me
of Muramasa. It was funny, however, just barely getting to the
camp site with a ton of enemies on my tail and them just
disappearing as I peacefully go to sleep. At least the camp site
looked magically glowing in some way, like the old games.

the style of the game but already I feel like I wish I had a bit
more freedom with how to approach things. I don't think I will go
for 100% but I do want to milk a few more hours out of the game.

I also realized that Skullface can't be Zero, based on that tape
that you hear after the credits.

will do it again for an S-rank, unless it is needed to get another
tape. I'm not sure what I would really do differently if I did it
again. So far, I'm at about a dollar per hour of fun and I still
need to do the other missions, so I think I'm going to be okay
with my investment.

I did get another tape that had an Interrogation where Skullface
seems to rip off Paz's clothes and talks about her body to Chico
and tells Chico to rape her. Yikes. That's intense and
disturbingly unnecessary. I suspect that Skullface is really Zero
or someone else in Cipher.

interesting if they were the previous generation's "university
folk" through centuries of a game of telephone. I'd want one of the
main characters to be captured or have gotten into the Apostles and
then find out the true scoop, or realize that they need to start a
religion to be able to ensure that the message gets passed down
long enough to protect the next generation. It seems like a big
missed opportunity.

got spotted as soon as I went underground because I was being
sloppy and didn't case the situation enough, despite having
interrogated a guard as to where other guards would be. I managed
to get away and then hide over a period of time. I did have to
fight off some people, but I managed to circle around an obstacle
