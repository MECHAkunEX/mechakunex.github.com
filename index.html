I tried the next DmD
level (mission 17) and didn't get very far. I feel like the combat
is really rote now. I have a strategy that works but just requires
a bit of finesse and luck to perfectly pull off. It isn't good
enough that I feel amazing trashing the enemies and it isn't bad
enough that I feel like I need to go learn a new
technique. Overall, it's made the game very bland for me.

Bayonetta felt a lot different than this, because you go to a
point with your dodging that you were just invincible and it was
great.

I tried the Heaven and Hell difficulty level on the first mission
and it was a total joke. You can just shot everything a single
time with your bullet and then knock away their shield if
necessary, even the boss. It's a bit funny to the extreme, but not
for more than a lark.

In the end, I found this game to be *very* good, but not as good
as Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising.

I
enjoyed the story and the gameplay was fine, but I didn't like the
gameplay enough to justify going through again just for a few new
scenes. Maybe I'll watch them on YouTube.

Overall, I found this game way too easy and it had too many
systems that were just unnecessary. There were a ton of Skills
that I would never use because it just didn't matter. For
instance, Jude has the ability to dodge attacks, but you can just
absorb them by setting Elize to heal all the time. There's no
point to almost anyone's Link Partner abilities. I even fought
some of the super bosses on Unknown difficulty and found
this. Graces was totally the opposite. The story was pretty neat
and that made it worthwhile to go through the first time.

chunks. I finished all the bonus content I intended to in the
first playthrough of the game. I maxed out every shop, every
character, got all the Devil Arms all the way powered up, and got
a bunch more titles based on completing some side
things. Altogether, the bonus round was about 18 hours.

I then started a new game as Milla. I only played for about thirty
minutes. I picked my Grade Shop selection---Shop Levels, Gald,
Accessories, Special Items, Devil's Arms, 2x EXP, 5x EXP, AC+1,
Arte Usage, 3x Crit, 2x Damage---and then played up to the Agria
fight. It's fun to relive the story from her perspective so far. I
anticipate that the game will be insanely easy. I'm already at
level 10, for instance. Once I stack my 10x EXP with some Food,
it'll be pretty insane. On one hand, I think I can race through,
but on the other, I want to make sure I experience her story
well. I'm not sure I'm willing to spend another many many hours on
this game... given that I think the combat was really easy to
begin with. Maybe I'll just mozy through and not worry about
getting any more titles... since it's not like I'm going to play
again and I already have all the Grade purchases I would want.
