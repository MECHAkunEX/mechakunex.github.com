Moderate for the fight. I want to unlock the harder difficulties.

--

Later in the day, I played a bit more and got Richard his kingdom
back. In the fight against Victoria, I did it on Hard, but Asbel
died at the last second of the battle and I couldn't heal him (it
was like... frames apart) and so he didn't get any experience! I
was tempted to restart it but decided not to. I had to fight
Cedric many times and eventually dropped it to Normal rather than
grinding. I felt a little dirty.

I really like the Cooking system. It's very cute and I like how
it works mechanically.

Evil movies. The setup is crazy, absurd, and retcons everything of
the past ones... for example, apparently every star of the past
movies is a clone! (This is to be able to have tons of cameos.) My
favourite part of the clone thing is when Becky says to Michelle
Rodriguez #3 that she met "her sister (and she wasn't very
nice)". Hah!

It's brilliant and so dumb that they were able to create a video
game-style "level" setup with the various test sites. Strangely,
it is so reminiscent of the first one, it's one of the best. I
think Alice's care for Becky is sweet.

The final sequence is insane and Wesker is ridiculous and annoying
as usual. I wonder what will happen next?

This review blurb is great: ``Clark Collis from Entertainment
Weekly also gave the film a mostly positive review, stating that
"writer-director W.S. Anderson's overseeing of the Resident Evil
zombie franchise has proven to be both lunatically haphazard and

me better against them in other levels too. I had a few tough
experiences with the big ships kind of in the middle, but learned
to take one out then stay behind the other. The final room felt
very challenging, but really only took me three times. The key was
to get rid of the hedgehogs and then take it slow getting the

converted? The interaction with Richard is very sweet. The
introduction of the Pascal character is ridiculously
convenient. I enjoy her absurdity though... especially when she
wants Sophie to high-five her.

When I started playing today, I upped the difficulty, but died
shortly thereafter, so went back down to Moderate. The boss fight
in the cave took me three times and a lot of changes of
strategy. I like that it is getting difficult. (I'm also strapped

I liked the original and I thought
this was a great modernization. It did a very good job of having
many layers of memories and doubt at what his true personality was.

Some little things:
- The Fall was very cool
- At one point near the end of the movie, Quaid refers to the name
of Jessica Biel's character and even though it's the end of the
movie, this is the first time we've heard her name.
- Jessica Biel is convincing as an action person, although she
doesn't have enough practice as Kate Beckinsale.
- Beckinsale looks great, as usual. My wife noticed how everything
about her character is to be super sexy. She can't stand still or
talk on the phone without pouting or standing
seductively. Whereas Biel puts her hair in a pony-tail when they
are chased, Beckinsale leaves her hair down so it looks better. I
don't think these things are terrible, but it is interesting.

The worst thing about Beckinsale's character is the ridiculously
bad lines she's given. They are bad for an 80s star: "I give
good wife." (This makes no sense, is out of context in the
scene, and is just there to make you think of her doing
something else.) "Do you think I'd let you leave without one
last kiss?" and many lines like it that are lame 50s Spider
Man/Batman quips.
- Seeing the three-breasted woman was a surprise given the rating.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/01/03/Game--Bangai-O-HD--Missile-Fury--X360--2011--8.html">Game: Bangai-O HD: Missile Fury (X360, 2011) (9)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/01/">01</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/01/03/">03</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for 30 minutes today and did 40 and 41.

I played 42 for a while, but couldn't get past the first Longai-O,

Later in the day I played for another two-ish hours. I got to a
lot of tragedy in Asbel's life. I think they really sold his
change of personality and it is interesting too. I'm curious to
see what will happen. It's a little strange for him to go from one
trope to another though... first he's annoying brash anime
character and now he's annoying somber anime character.

The battles after he grows up are a lot more difficult and

I spent the first 30-ish
minutes trying to do Stage 35 and then gave up for a bit and
tried Stage 36. When that was still hard, I went back to Stage 35
and beat it. (Along with getting two achievements.)

Stage 35 --- I eventually won by using the Napalm and doing a
Dash-to-Freeze pattern over and over against Longai-O. The giant
guy was easy once I got behind him and I did the final room in
one try.

Stage 36 --- This seems impossible. I was able to race back on one
of the times I tried, but didn't kill everything, which is when I
learned I had to.

This game is getting to the point where it is so hard that I feel
like it hard to play for more than an hour or so at a time
because I'm just doing the same level over and over again. I
still love it... it's just stressful.

----

Later in the day, I did another hour.

Stage 36 --- I eventually did this and the key was getting a lot
of practice and learning to conserve my counters well. After a few
tries, I did it.

Stage 37 --- This was a totally insane level full of
Dash-and-Counter forever. I'm amazed that this was in the
tutorial.

Stage 38 --- This level had a totally obscene amount of bullets
and it was totally insane when it first started, because I had no
idea what was going to happen. Eventually it was pretty easy once
I made a point of taking out the batters on the right first.

Stage 39 --- This was a challenging and fun level. The key was to
dash along the force fields and then counter every few segments
to kill the ones of the top. I wasn't totally perfect... I missed
a few things a few times, so I had to backtrack a little bit. It
made it so I had only 15 seconds to spare when I won.

Stage 40 --- This is a really tough level because each phase is
so different. I got to the two Longai-O once, but have a very
hard time freezing them in general, so I failed. I can reasonably
reliably get past the first stage, but the ants really get me.

glimpse of the battle system (in the form of tips after every
battle.) I'll probably do an hour of this and an hour of another
game for a bit. It's pretty funny to me the sharp contrast between
this and Bangai-O... this is so ridiculously slow compared to it.

----

In the evening, I played again for about twenty minutes. I just
did scenes and met Asbel's father. I thought the reaction from
Cheria about what the plan for Sophie would be was hilarious. The
characters and interactions in this game are already really
enjoyable even after a short time.

Mechanically, I got two more titles and I think I will have to max
out each one because I'm crazy.

shooting missiles while pushing the blocks to destroy the turrets

place. Then it was just a matter of kiting a little.

yet. When I watched a video of someone beating it... it seems so
easy but I can't seem to do it. I'll have to try something else.

I just did
two stages.

Stage 32 --- This was a frustrating level... not really that hard,
but it was very difficult to control your fire, since the rest of
the game is designed around shooting tons and tons of bullets. In
this level, the ceiling can collapse if you touch it, blocking you
in from the rest of the level. You have to be very controlled in
your fighting. It was definitely interesting though.

Stage 33 --- This was a very fun "arena"-style level with three
phases of enemies. First, there's a maze of hedgehogs and their
generators. Then, a bunch of spinning things appear with some
support. (A few ninjas too!) Finally, a bunch of Napalm-shooting
tanks and Longai-O (?) appear. It was very challenging to deal
with everything, although I'd say the first and last phase were
the hardest. But, you got so much practice with the first one, it
felt easy at the end.
