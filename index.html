  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don&#8217;t
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff.</p>

<p>Normal games can&#8217;t be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don&#8217;t give instant, infinite
respawns.</p>

<p>This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next.</p>

<p>(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them&#8230; it is horrifically bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played and beat this tonight. Last time I played, I could barely
get past the first level because it is so brutal and you need to
grind, but it&#8217;s practically impossible. This time, I tried to use
a code that gave more hearts per heart icon you got, but it didn&#8217;t
really help. I used a password that gave me more levels and that
made a big difference. The hardest part of the game was the third
fortress, because it was so complex of a labyrinth. It&#8217;s a fun
game&#8230; a little too floaty jumps and the inability to scroll
backward is bit rough, but for an old game it has pretty decent
mechanics. Although it is a classic in my memory, it&#8217;s systems
don&#8217;t live up to being a real classic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We saw this movie advertised at the beginning of another and it
seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren&#8217;t even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn&#8217;t utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.</p>

beat the third challenge. I did really good on the third full

last place by the end. Ouch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife and I saw this tonight [which is why I wanted to write down
my thoughts about the other ones.] I found a lot about this movie a
lot better than QoS. I thought the movie was paced a lot better and
the new characters were quite interesting. On the other hand, there
wasn&#8217;t really an deep connections. Even the deepest connection
(between M and 007) wasn&#8217;t developed much. In addition, the goal of
the villain wasn&#8217;t at a very big scale. He was almost Bane or
Joker-ish in his abilities, but had a trivial revenge scheme
planned. There were lots of holes and missed opportunities&#8212;why
not just blow up MI6 when M was there if he wanted to kill her so
bad? Why was Severine with the guy getting killed? Why would
Patrice be necessarily working for the same guy twice? Severine&#8217;s
death was totally ignored and Bond doesn&#8217;t even acknowledge it
happens. The island is a wasted set. The best parts are the
committee hearing and the showdown at Skyfall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a much more traditional Bond movie, with a ridiculous and
large scale evil plot. I felt like the feel of the movie was a lot
different and that the beginning is much better and tighter than
the end. There are lots of bombshells in the movie, but they dwell
on Bond&#8217;s ability to conquest a bit less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is such an amazing movie. The whole story-arc of Vesper is so
powerful and heart-breaking. The first half of the film has so
many super high energy exciting parts&#8230; like the opening and the
airport. The film has lots of great lines and funny parts&#8230; like
at the country club and between Bond and Vesper. This is really great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun caper movie. The story is very complicated and has
lots of twists, in a way that reminiscent of Ocean&#8217;s Eleven, but
with more off-the-wall occurrences. I feel like there were a lot
of things that should have been explained, because they would have
been very interesting, that weren&#8217;t. For example, how Penelope
manages to get out of Prague. In general though, after about the
first third, the characters (which beforehand were fascinating)
all have their identities fixed and then they never change. We
learn a lot about Penelope in the beginning, but then she&#8217;s
static. Similarly, the ending just doesn&#8217;t feel right given what
we know about the character&#8217;s feelings. Nevertheless, it was a
unique and cute movie.</p>
