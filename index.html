hours. The last two levels were fun, although I find the forced
walking sequences excruciating. I didn't even replay the ending
to make the other choice because I didn't want to go through the
walking.

After I beat it, I did a few more levels to get achievements, but
I got annoyed pretty fast trying to find a level to do a few of
them on, so I didn't get two of them. I decided not to play New
Game Plus, right now at least, so I can start a new game. But I
might in the future.

Overall, I found this game to be pretty amazing. It definitely
goes in the canon for me.

I don't think it matters much, but my final score was 243,950 and
my rank was 1729/42718.

I like that there is no pre-title
screen movie and it just gets right in to an awesome animation of
Raiden.

When I hit start, I decided to play on Hard... and I think it was
a good choice. I only played for about an hour and had three
little skirmishes and three boss fights. The boss fights were very
hard as I was still just learning the game; I think I did each at
least 5 or 6 times. Even the skirmishes feel hard because I
haven't really mastered the parrying system yet, but it is a lot
of fun.

This game is basically Metal Gear Bayonetta, which is
great. (Although parrying is a lot different than dodging and the
ninja run doesn't really have a corollary in Bayonetta.) I'm
super excited about continuing it.

From a story/style perspective, it totally feels like the Metal
Gear world. The characters, what they talk about, the feel, etc
are all right. They've even done a great job using the same fonts
and visual motifs from Metal Gear Solid 4. I like being in the
world and I like seeing the world using a different gameplay
format. It's neat.

I did the Blade at His Neck
level twice, so I could go through with combat and without so I
could get all the stars (I got all the other things the first try
with the Stealth Suit, but missed a scroll and had to back-track a
lot, plus wasn't getting a good score.) I used Hunter the second
time because I knew it was a combat-heavy level. 

The next level, I played through twice, but not because I wanted a
different score, but because the game crashed in a Challenge Room,
which was a major bummer. When I did it the second time, I used
the Stealth Suit and didn't touch an enemy so I could get all the
bonuses. It was very hard to do the Seals, but very satisfying as
well.

It
is amazing. I love stealth games (actually, I've only really
played Metal Gear, so I guess I just love Metal Gear) and this
game is an /amazing/ stealth game. It is /so/ good at giving you
control over everything you need to do, who can see you, etc. It's
pretty awesome.

I played through four or five levels, getting 100% every time
(except the last one... I didn't find one scroll and I couldn't do
the hanging seal because I didn't have that technique
yet... bummer.) I did one level twice because I got 200 points
less than required for the third star. It's pretty amazing to
spend an hour on every level and love it. I'm very excited to
play more of it and experiment more.

The first outfit I earned was the Hunter and I just got the
Stealth one. I think I will try it out a bit. I feel like I'm
going to want to get a Platinum one this game.

--

In the afternoon, I played for another hour and a half and
repeated one level then did another one again. This game is /so/
much fun!

--

In the evening I played another two hours and did a few more
levels, including one without interacting with any enemies using
the Stealth Suit, which was awesome.  The last level I did, the
Inner Keep, was real tough, especially near the end and making
sure I got all the Seals. One annoying thing was that the
"natural" order to get the scrolls isn't 1, 2, 3, but 2, 1, 3, so
when I got the second, I assumed I had missed the first and did a
lot of wasteful back-tracking.  I got a lot of achievements some
how, but I'm not really sure what I did to get them. This game is
still pretty awesome.

one more ability... something to do with Wind and I think I need a
Yellow Resonance Gem.

In the evening I played for another almost two hours and beat the
game. The ending was really epic. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I
feel like the combat has a pretty good flow, it's beautiful, and
there's a lot of neat Metroid-vania style exploration that's fun
to check off. I don't think there's a huge amount of depth to the
combat and I don't feel like going through and getting 100% on
everything, but it was definitely a good experience. I'm struck by
how much time I "lost" to playing on the Hardcore difficulty for
so long. I feel like it wasn't the kind of difficulty I like
though, because there's very little that you can do differently,
or at least it felt that way.

I'm very impressed that it was all made by one guy. Bravo!

overall I'd say it was incredibly different.

Something that was a nice surprise was the reference to *REDACTED*ism

when you are at lower difficulty, you gain levels faster, which is
ridiculous I think. I think you should be rewarded by playing at a
more difficult level. Ugh.

I
made a lot of progress in the story of the game. I had lots of
frustrating rooms where the hardcore mode is really being a
pain. By comparing the game clock and my accounting, I can see
that I have spent 2 hours on runs that ended in me dying.

I think the worst room so far had nothing to do with hardcore mode
though: there's a room underground where there are no lights and
tons of platforms with spikes on the bottoms. You have to navigate
a bomb through it to light your way to gather some treasure. Since
the control you have over the bomb is so bad, it is likely to blow
up by hitting the platforms. I got the treasure three times before
I made it back out to the save point. So painful.

I'm continuing to like the game and still finding the combat to
very basic. A telling example was the boss of the underground
area. My strategy: jump at her, press X a few times, dash behind
her, repeat. I found no reason to do anything more complicated,
which I see as a flaw in the game.

I did the first two trials in the game and they were
interesting. Something I'm finding is that I can't tell if I am
getting anything valuable from doing quests. Also, when you are
buying equipment at the store, it doesn't show you what effect it
will have on your stats, so you have decide through some other way
(like by memorizing the stats of the current equipment) whether it
is a good purchase. Annoying.

Spelunky. It has been on my mind since I first saw a trailer for
it a few years before it came out. Brad on the Giantbombcast had a
lot of good things to say about it, so I was excited to try it out
eventually.

I played for a little more than two hours and my first impressions
of the game were good. The graphics are beautiful. The voice
acting is not horrific, but not amazing either so I'm tending to
just read the subtitles and skip to the next piece of text. The
world is very interesting and doesn't feel to "same-y".

I'm playing on Hardcore mode and the combat feels pretty tight
and fun. It's very comparable to Muramasa, except I feel like
this game doesn't have as much to offer and doesn't have any
complex/interesting mechanic like the sword strength
maintenance. I haven't found the Fidget attacks to be very
useful, so the game is really just attacking with the sword and
dodging for me. Since I'm on Hardcore, I basically cannot get hit
a single time or I will die. (I have 80 HP and most attacks do
about 120 HP damage right now.) This has the bonus of making it
so there is no point to using healing items because everything is
a one-hit kill anyways.

So far I've only seen four types of monsters and they are
basically all fodder if you pay a little bit of attention to
where they are and dodge properly.

The speed of the game is good when you are progressing into new
areas, but when you are going back to old areas it is very
painful because the movement is just too slow when you know where
you are going.

After less than an
hour, I had unlocked the Ice Caves short-cut. Within 15 minutes, I
had gotten to the Temple twice. I found the Ice Caves to be pretty
easy, but also really random. Since it is so vertical and open,
you can pretty easily jump right to the end. This means for me
that it isn't really worth it to open up the short-cut, although
it is painful to go through. After another thirty minutes or so, I
got to Olmec but didn't realize where his hit box is or something
and died right away. (I only had 1 HP anyways.) After another
thirty minutes or so I got back and did him in. I like that he's
basically Bowser from Super Mario Brothers 3.

Overall, I had 209 attempts. I know that there's another way to
beat the game (by going through all the secret areas) but I don't
love the game enough to do it. (That's why I marked it as not
completed.) Maybe I haven't played long enough to truly discover
it, but I feel like the game really doesn't have that much of
complex strategy. When I eventually won or got to Olmec, I wasn't
doing much different than the other times. There were lots of
really bizarre random chances. It's definitely fun, but not enough
fun to invest a ton more time into honing my skills. (On the other
hand, I've watched a few videos that show people dying and
starting again and they have amazing technique that is basically
perfect every time. So there's definitely something there, but I
don't want to achieve that level.)

I had a lot of fun with it and could imagine coming back to it if
I could have a tighter loop of getting into it. It would also be
awesome if the co-op were more effective for my situation.

Compared to Fez, which I just played, I think Spelunky is a
/better/ game but not a game that I love enough to beat it with
the absoluteness I did to Fez, which seems contradictory, but I
think makes sense if you think about it.

stick so that I know how to. My wife and I talked about trying the
local co-op, but I only have one normal Xbox controller, so she'll
have to use that. Playing with stick feels like it forces me to
move a bit slower and methodically, which is good. I think the
hardest thing to do is run which, again, is a good thing.

I got to the Jungle two times in my little play session and was
able to unlock the short-cut to it.  I read a bit of a FAQ about
the achievements and they are very intimidating. I feel like I
will just want to beat it normally. I'm not sure if I should try
to play through it from the start always or use the
short-cuts. The short-cuts are a nice way to feel like you're
making progress definitely, but it also seems like you are denying
yourself the ability to gather resources from the early stages.

I like using the Compass and bombs to get to the bottom quickly.

In the evening, I played for about 45 minutes, most of the time
with my wife. We found playing two player to be very
frustrating. The game requires a lot of coordination and it is
easy to make a mistake that totally disrupts the other
player---particularly because the camera follows the first
player. For example, if you accidentally fall or get shot, you
are likely to force scroll the screen and kill them. Not a recipe
for marital bliss.

Some
of the final things were crazy. Changing the system clock to get
the clock to move was absurd. I got the tome and after looking
through it, just read the translation online. I don't really care
that much about the world of Fez, but it was cute. I translated a
sign that said: "Trapped in a Fez factory, please send help."
Turning the skulls was funny, because I could've done it so early
but didn't realize about grabbing things yet. I got four crashes
total in the game, I think. The 64-cube ending was neat and kind
of the opposite of the other one: zoom out vs zoom in.

Overall, I enjoyed the game. The puzzles were pleasant and the
weird deciphering stuff was unique. I ended up needing 3 pages of
notes and it was fun to make them.
