of the meadow, until I got the climbing ability and then I went
back to earlier areas to try and get some hidden items that were
unreachable before. Some of the places in the meadow were pretty
rough. The spinning bird/knife-arm creatures are really tough and
can one-hit me really viciously. I'm still having fun with the
game, but I'm finding the combat to be a little
tedious. Basically the only thing I'm doing is dodging and then
hitting X. I've discovered another technique though: using the
lightning Fidget attack can stun enemies while I recharge my
combo ability.

I
made a lot of progress in the story of the game. I had lots of
frustrating rooms where the hardcore mode is really being a
pain. By comparing the game clock and my accounting, I can see
that I have spent 2 hours on runs that ended in me dying.

I think the worst room so far had nothing to do with hardcore mode
though: there's a room underground where there are no lights and
tons of platforms with spikes on the bottoms. You have to navigate
a bomb through it to light your way to gather some treasure. Since
the control you have over the bomb is so bad, it is likely to blow
up by hitting the platforms. I got the treasure three times before
I made it back out to the save point. So painful.

I'm continuing to like the game and still finding the combat to
very basic. A telling example was the boss of the underground
area. My strategy: jump at her, press X a few times, dash behind
her, repeat. I found no reason to do anything more complicated,
which I see as a flaw in the game.

I did the first two trials in the game and they were
interesting. Something I'm finding is that I can't tell if I am
getting anything valuable from doing quests. Also, when you are
buying equipment at the store, it doesn't show you what effect it
will have on your stats, so you have decide through some other way
(like by memorizing the stats of the current equipment) whether it
is a good purchase. Annoying.

Spelunky. It has been on my mind since I first saw a trailer for
it a few years before it came out. Brad on the Giantbombcast had a
lot of good things to say about it, so I was excited to try it out
eventually.

I played for a little more than two hours and my first impressions
of the game were good. The graphics are beautiful. The voice
acting is not horrific, but not amazing either so I'm tending to
just read the subtitles and skip to the next piece of text. The
world is very interesting and doesn't feel to "same-y".

I'm playing on Hardcore mode and the combat feels pretty tight
and fun. It's very comparable to Muramasa, except I feel like
this game doesn't have as much to offer and doesn't have any
complex/interesting mechanic like the sword strength
maintenance. I haven't found the Fidget attacks to be very
useful, so the game is really just attacking with the sword and
dodging for me. Since I'm on Hardcore, I basically cannot get hit
a single time or I will die. (I have 80 HP and most attacks do
about 120 HP damage right now.) This has the bonus of making it
so there is no point to using healing items because everything is
a one-hit kill anyways.

So far I've only seen four types of monsters and they are
basically all fodder if you pay a little bit of attention to
where they are and dodge properly.

The speed of the game is good when you are progressing into new
areas, but when you are going back to old areas it is very
painful because the movement is just too slow when you know where
you are going.

After less than an
hour, I had unlocked the Ice Caves short-cut. Within 15 minutes, I
had gotten to the Temple twice. I found the Ice Caves to be pretty
easy, but also really random. Since it is so vertical and open,
you can pretty easily jump right to the end. This means for me
that it isn't really worth it to open up the short-cut, although
it is painful to go through. After another thirty minutes or so, I
got to Olmec but didn't realize where his hit box is or something
and died right away. (I only had 1 HP anyways.) After another
thirty minutes or so I got back and did him in. I like that he's
basically Bowser from Super Mario Brothers 3.

Overall, I had 209 attempts. I know that there's another way to
beat the game (by going through all the secret areas) but I don't
love the game enough to do it. (That's why I marked it as not
completed.) Maybe I haven't played long enough to truly discover
it, but I feel like the game really doesn't have that much of
complex strategy. When I eventually won or got to Olmec, I wasn't
doing much different than the other times. There were lots of
really bizarre random chances. It's definitely fun, but not enough
fun to invest a ton more time into honing my skills. (On the other
hand, I've watched a few videos that show people dying and
starting again and they have amazing technique that is basically
perfect every time. So there's definitely something there, but I
don't want to achieve that level.)

I had a lot of fun with it and could imagine coming back to it if
I could have a tighter loop of getting into it. It would also be
awesome if the co-op were more effective for my situation.

Compared to Fez, which I just played, I think Spelunky is a
/better/ game but not a game that I love enough to beat it with
the absoluteness I did to Fez, which seems contradictory, but I
think makes sense if you think about it.

The idea of most of the Navy being women and having shaved heads

move a bit slower and methodically, which is good. I think the
hardest thing to do is run which, again, is a good thing.

I got to the Jungle two times in my little play session and was
able to unlock the short-cut to it.  I read a bit of a FAQ about
the achievements and they are very intimidating. I feel like I
will just want to beat it normally. I'm not sure if I should try
to play through it from the start always or use the
short-cuts. The short-cuts are a nice way to feel like you're
making progress definitely, but it also seems like you are denying
yourself the ability to gather resources from the early stages.

I like using the Compass and bombs to get to the bottom quickly.

In the evening, I played for about 45 minutes, most of the time
with my wife. We found playing two player to be very
frustrating. The game requires a lot of coordination and it is
easy to make a mistake that totally disrupts the other
player---particularly because the camera follows the first
player. For example, if you accidentally fall or get shot, you
are likely to force scroll the screen and kill them. Not a recipe
for marital bliss.

sign that said: "Trapped in a Fez factory, please send help."
Turning the skulls was funny, because I could've done it so early
but didn't realize about grabbing things yet. I got four crashes
total in the game, I think. The 64-cube ending was neat and kind
of the opposite of the other one: zoom out vs zoom in.

Overall, I enjoyed the game. The puzzles were pleasant and the
weird deciphering stuff was unique. I ended up needing 3 pages of

I think the running speed is a little too fast and I haven't

this game and succeed is to go incredibly slowly and calculate
every risk. At this point I feel like that won't be a very fun way
to play, because in platformers I love the feeling of running and

discoveries. I discovered the Tetromino code and got the Telescope
worked out. I was also able to use one of the pillars and do the
door room. Finding the Tetris code was awesome because there was
so much I could do with it. Just before I finished that session, I
found the Rosetta Stone of the alphabet... although so far I
haven't found any useful text.

Later in the day I played again and found the number code and then
got to the ancient city. (I had been exploring the world and never
going to back to the waterfall area.) Something funny happened, I
had already got 32 cubes before getting to the city and Dot said
something about going back to a door there. I explored it and
inadvertently beat the game. I was nervous when I saw New Game+,
because I didn't want to get everything again, but was glad that I
just got the sunglasses.

I played for another two hours and got a lot more, including the
many Tuning Forks. Right now I have just got through the Lava
area... which was terrifying. I don't have another key to use in
the Sewer, so I'm nervous that I'll to find my way back here.

I've continued to find the platforming to be fun and the puzzley
aspects of the game to be nice. I think the alphabet is a bit
over-kill because it is just so painful to translate anything. I'd
much prefer giving proof that I know what it means and then having
the game auto-translate or something.

has gotten more challenging and interesting. I quite like that the
map shows when there is a "secret" somewhere you have not
completed.

In the creepy area, there was this set of doors that seemed to be
confusingly placed. I mapped everything out but didn't get
anywhere. Later, I realized that I had treasure maps on me that
showed some stuff related to that area, but it also had symbols I
haven't figured out yet.

The area near the clock is interesting because it feels like a
place where other dimensional shifters lived. I feel like I'll
have to go back there a lot.

Still annoyed at the lack of fast travel. Also, the game crashed
once. Lame. I would have stopped playing if I lost anything, but
didn't, so that's good.

Oh man, that
was insane. This game is soooo good, but that last boss was so
ridiculously hard. The very very last boss was tough, but just
took a little bit of practice to get the pattern down. It almost
feels like a bonus stage now in comparison with the one before
it. I think I will put this game on a monthly
play-through-the-whole-game-on-Easy rotation, so I can remember
its awesomeness forever.

I ended with Asbel at level
80, which is crazy to me, because I was roughly that level after
getting to Zhonecage (after almost 100 hours) the first time. I
had 518 encounters in the New Game+, the total battle time was 48
minutes, which means the average battle length was 5.5 seconds!
It's also pretty amazing to me that only 9% of my play time was
fighting this time, especially because I skipped every cut-scene,
had 2x movement speed, and was just running from boss to boss.

I've decided that I'm done with the game. The only things left
that I could do is (a) get all the Carta cards, which would be
super tedious; (b) get the Turtlez Togz from the Dark Turtlez,
which would be super tedious; (c) get the Eleth Mixer to 9999,
which even checking out what apparently is the fastest way to do
it, would be crazy; and, (d) get the title trophies for the men,
which would probably be painful because it mean having lots of
battles and managing what skills they used.

This was a very fun game. The battle system is great and the story
is a lot of fun. The world is cool too. I think my only complaints
about it are very minor: the user interface on some things could
have been better. For example, being able to have sets of AI
settings for different situations, sets of mixer settings as well,
and being able to pick a result you wanted from the dualizing
system (that you had already discovered) rather than having to
remember the recipe in your head. The AI was also pretty
unreliable as a healer. I found that it almost never tried to
resurrect dead characters and if you told it to, then it was hit,
it would not remember what your last instruction was. This was
very annoying.

The
total time to win was 6 hours and 12 minutes. Something amazing
happened, I had the various spheres on the mixer the entire time
and finally got 1 Darkened Ore in the last hour of gameplay and an
Enasphere in literally the walk up to where you fight the last
boss (so I had to turn around, save, and get it made into Asbel's
best sword.) I beat Lambda in 60 seconds, as well. Nice!

Next, I fought Lambda again on Chaos and used the Cheria piggyback
trick. The key was to get hurt by a ranged attack and beforehand
get rid of his Nova barrier right away with a quick spell.

After doing that, I played for another two hours-ish and got to
the Lastalia Core in the Future arc. In the evening I played for
another 30 minutes and beat the game... killing the Fodra Queen
in 60 seconds (actually 24) on the first try. Nice!

After doing the future arc, my grade is now 3551.

My next goal is the Platinum PSN trophy... the only barriers are
titles for the men and a 9999 mixer... which all seem pretty
painful to get. I'm going to look into the details tomorrow and
decide if I will do it. I'll also look up my battle stats for the
New Game+, I think that will be interesting.
