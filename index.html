and the first fight of the next one. The two stages were very
short: Escape from Denver had four fights, I think, and the next
was just a boss fight. When I was doing Escape from Denver, I
suddenly realized it was part of the earlier Denver stage but
backwards so it looked different. I remember Kamiya saying they
did that with Bayonetta too.

The fight with Sam was pretty cool and the parrying technique
wasn't trivial to implement. In general, my parrying is so good
now that I can take on numerous enemies of a type where one would
have brought me down before.

It was cool to see Sunny.

I closed out more of the upgrade shop.

I like the discussion of the holy language of Jaddeth and where
converts should have to learn it. I think there's something similar
in *REDACTED*ism and English because all translations have to made from
English because the source of the Book of *REDACTED* is not available.

I like the discussion of using the Seons in Jaddeth's empire. It
is reminiscent to me of Islamic fundamentalists using technology
for their military purposes, yet claiming that technology designed
for improving people's lives is immoral.

I like that when Raoden meets with Karata the revelation is that
children are the greatest happiness in life and all toil is worth
it if you can take care of them.

My wife had the brilliant idea to see each of the characters as a
different model of leadership. Raoden has optimism and can give
people hope, by putting them to productive ends. Hrathen and
Sarene are both calculating and political, but I think they
represent those skills being put towards bad and good ends, so
they are interesting exemplars.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html">Movie: The Expendables 2, starring Everyone Awesome (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/27/">27</a></span></span><pre class="content">This movie is better in many ways than the first one.

pessimistic and negative towards having kids (despite Chris Rock's
unbelievable monologue.) I never really felt not wanting
responsibility or the fear, so I was disappointed that there was
no one like that in the movie.

I enjoyed the Rosie/Marco plot a lot and wished that he would be
more romantic.

I disliked all the unwed pregnancies.

I'm mastering the game a lot more... I've discovered that when you
are cutting off left arms, it is best to aim yourself, but when
you are doing a Ninja Kill, etc, it is best to just use the
Square/Triangle buttons to get an immediate one.

There's lots of stuff I'm clearly missing, because I will get VR
Mission 9 and then 12. I want to play it again anyways, so that's
fine, but it's a bit annoying to think that I've looked everywhere
but have actually missed some stuff.

This game is still great.

In the evening I played for about three hours. I played through
the rest of outside the tower and then the inside, so I fought the
Sundowner guy, who has seemed like the big bad most of the
time. In the fight outside the tower with Monsoon, I finally got
the Parry system down. The key was to realize that it was much
faster than I thought and that you could parry while being hurt
and stunned. Now I feel like I can take on anything.

The fight with Sundowner was intense, but I think I did it the
slow way, because I didn't get off all his armored plates by the
end. The sequence going up the tower was pretty crazy.

I'm a bit surprised that the child-soldier-brain-extraction thing
seems to be /the/ plot, whereas I had originally assumed it would
just be the prelude to something else.

I'm starting to complete some of the upgrade trees, I wonder if
I've missed hidden stuff in the levels?

The opening of the next chapter was pretty nuts... jumping out of
a helicopter onto a jet flying by... very cool.

thoughts.

- The contrast between Dilaf's zealotry and Hrathen's practicality
is very interesting. For example, Dilaf says something like
"Nothing can stand in Jaddeth's way" as an argument against why
they should do some plan for the Kae. Hrathen's response is,
"Then why isn't the whole world converted?" One idea I can see in
this is that often the "sophisticated theology" of the
upper-class of religionists make them have almost totally
different beliefs than the lower-class, to the point that the
upper-class may not even seem like they believe at all. I get
this impression about *REDACTED*ism a lot when people talk about how
to treat new converts, especially those in far away places.

- Hrathen gives a very *REDACTED* explanation of the Svarkiss: "Nothing
is more bitter than a soul who had had its chance and thrown it
away." This is the way that Satan and his followers are discussed
a lot in *REDACTED*ism and how many ex-members are seen.

- A poignant moment in one of Raoden's chapters is the discussion
of how Elantris was not built for normal people to live
in---there are no wells or furnances or lights---and that after
the fall of AonDor it is totally desolate. How is this related to
Modern worry about a too heavy reliance on technology and the
desire to train ourselves to live without in times of disaster?

- I like that Sarene's plan to change the government is so
libertarian and capitalistic. You can almost see the debate on
what to do as a debate about how to intervene in communist
countries and/or get them to change for the better. Freedom
works.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/23/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--2.html">Game: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PS3, 2013) (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this morning for about three hours and made some progress
on the mission. I'm having some slightly annoying moments trying
to get the special arms from the commanders where I have to
restart from the last checkpoint so I can try again to get them. I
also found an exploit where I could keep getting a BP Holochip
over and over again, so I did that for a while to amass a huge
amount of BP to buy what I want going forward.

Since the game is bloody and against humans, I don't really want
to play it around my kids, so I'm not able to play it as much,
which is a little sad.

It's funny that I've already played it for longer more than it was
rumored to take in the days leading up to its release.

--

Later in the day I played for another hour and finished the first
big mission and then started the second. The intro to the second
was hilarious... Raiden in a giant sombrero. You can tell it has
that Metal Gear wackiness. Later in the level, there's this
strange kid from Guyana with a weird accent who thinks you're a
ninja and says "Go Ninja! Go Ninja! Go!" and "Cowabunga", like
TMNT.

Right when I met him though, was an insanely difficult fight with
three Raptor enemies. I played it maybe five times, each time
making almost no progress at all. On maybe the fourth time, I
noticed that I could get a ninja attack on them, so I tried
spamming that while parrying and dodging... and I beat them in
just a few seconds. Crazy. I thought I was going to have to
restart and getting some healing items or something.

This game definitely feels like a Platinum game, but it's really
unique compared to Vanquish or Bayonetta in what you're
doing... but it "feels" the same. It's great.

--

Before bed I played for about an hour and a half, I made it
through a few rooms. There was a really rough part with some of
the "Silverback" enemies where I had to Stealth-kill them because
they were too powerful to take on all at once, but it was very
hard to sneak up on the third one because he was up
high. Eventually I was able to do it because of a fluke: he fell
off but I didn't, so I hid in a box until the alarm went down
then I did a from-above-Stealth-kill.

The moment in the story of seeing all the detached brains is
CARAZY. Kojima has used child soldiers as a plot point before, but
this is even more bizarre. It's definitely effective for the story
beat it is going for.

book club, so I decided to read it again to help her think of
things to talk about during the meeting.

I read the first two chapters today and thought a lot about the
book from a *REDACTED* perspective. (I'm *REDACTED* and so is Sanderson.)
Here are a few of the ideas, plus some that aren't really related
to *REDACTED*ism.

- Prior to the fall of Elantris, it is almost a *REDACTED*-like notion
of divinity, because anyone can achieve it, although it is given,
rather than earned, so grace is emphasized far more than works.

- In the treatment of people who receive the eternal "life" of
Elantris, what can we learn about how charitable people are?
As far as we know, there's nothing contagious about their
condition and there's no downside for their community, but they
are treated as dead, rejected, and locked up; all for something
they did not choose and have no control over. I can't help but
think of how many homosexuals feel they are treated by popular
American culture.

- The thing that is horrifying about life in Elantris is that it is
eternal and every pain you've ever felt stays with you forever. I
think this is a clear projection of what *REDACTED*ism says Hell is
like: all will inherit eternal life, whether they are "good" or
"bad", but if they reject the Atonement, then they will not allow
the Savior to absolve them of the pain they feel for their
sins. Elantris is a concrete version of this: rather than having
their pain and mistakes washed away so that they "remember them
no more", they remember and feel them forever. Elantris is *REDACTED*
Hell.

- Given that I know what's going to happen in the book, it is
interesting to see Elantris as Hell (or rather, the world without
the Atonement), because essential it makes Raoden Christ: He was
the son of the king of the world that controlled Elantris; he
suffers the same condition as the Elantris and leaves "his
throne on high"; once there, he feels their pain and will teach
them a new way to life with purpose; then, he will redeem them
and restore Elantris to its ancient glory.

- I love the character of Sarene, because she's such a strong and
determined woman in a community (i.e. the king's court) that
doesn't respect women, as shown by their first interaction
together. It is fun to see what she does and to gradually learn
who she is... I think she's a great role model and a surprising
character to be written by a young man in a fantasy novel.

- Clearly the parts that are literally about religion are likely
to be influence in some ways by *REDACTED*ism. I think in this
context though, I see the *REDACTED* understanding of Catholicism at
work. Hrathen and his religion is overtly foreign. He is adamant
that their job is not "love" the people but to "help" the
people, as if they are not the same.

On the other hand, there are aspects about his description of
Derethi that are like the popular understanding of *REDACTED*ism: it
has a rigid military-like structure with a lot of authority and
delegation; a revered prophet; etc. Then again, there's a lot of
Islam there too with the concept of the Caliphate.

Another relevant thing is that the language of religious zeal
Sanderson uses is distinctly *REDACTED*: Dilaf is converted and reads
the two sets of Derethi scriptures in the same night, reminiscent
of Parley P. Pratt and countless other *REDACTED* converts.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/23/Movie--Escape-from-Planet-Earth--by-Rainmaker-Entertainment--2013--0.html">Movie: Escape from Planet Earth, by Rainmaker Entertainment (2013)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I took my kids to see this because it was the earliest movie in the

progress on the first mission, fighting a boss and going through
a fun chase sequence. The boss really forced me to learn the
parrying system, although I wasted a lot of health regeneration
items during the fight. I want to try again.

I haven't yet looked into whether I can replay story chapters to
get better scores or things that I missed. For instance, I noticed
what looked like an enemy intel station on top of roof but
couldn't figure out how to get to it. I assumed that I couldn't
but then when I got the next one is was for VR Mission 003, rather
than 002. In retrospect, I bet I could have used the Ninja Run to
get up.

I'm trying to take my time with the game and listen to every
codec conversation and get all the stuff. I think I'll play
through once and then go back and make a list of the stuff I
missed and get them.

I'm really enjoying the gameplay and just starting to master
it. I'm enjoying the world a lot too. I feel like there are little
things fans... like how Raiden's boss say "Keep you waiting, eh?"
and how one of the cyborg is named Sam, like in Vanquish.

I got annoyed pretty fast trying to find a level to do a few of

might in the future.

Overall, I found this game to be pretty amazing. It definitely

I like that there is no pre-title
screen movie and it just gets right in to an awesome animation of
Raiden.

When I hit start, I decided to play on Hard... and I think it was
a good choice. I only played for about an hour and had three
little skirmishes and three boss fights. The boss fights were very
hard as I was still just learning the game; I think I did each at
least 5 or 6 times. Even the skirmishes feel hard because I
haven't really mastered the parrying system yet, but it is a lot
of fun.

This game is basically Metal Gear Bayonetta, which is
great. (Although parrying is a lot different than dodging and the
ninja run doesn't really have a corollary in Bayonetta.) I'm
super excited about continuing it.

From a story/style perspective, it totally feels like the Metal
Gear world. The characters, what they talk about, the feel, etc
are all right. They've even done a great job using the same fonts
and visual motifs from Metal Gear Solid 4. I like being in the
world and I like seeing the world using a different gameplay
format. It's neat.

I did the Blade at His Neck
level twice, so I could go through with combat and without so I
could get all the stars (I got all the other things the first try
with the Stealth Suit, but missed a scroll and had to back-track a
lot, plus wasn't getting a good score.) I used Hunter the second
time because I knew it was a combat-heavy level. 

The next level, I played through twice, but not because I wanted a
different score, but because the game crashed in a Challenge Room,
which was a major bummer. When I did it the second time, I used
the Stealth Suit and didn't touch an enemy so I could get all the
bonuses. It was very hard to do the Seals, but very satisfying as
well.

It
is amazing. I love stealth games (actually, I've only really
played Metal Gear, so I guess I just love Metal Gear) and this
game is an /amazing/ stealth game. It is /so/ good at giving you
control over everything you need to do, who can see you, etc. It's
pretty awesome.

I played through four or five levels, getting 100% every time
(except the last one... I didn't find one scroll and I couldn't do
the hanging seal because I didn't have that technique
yet... bummer.) I did one level twice because I got 200 points
less than required for the third star. It's pretty amazing to
spend an hour on every level and love it. I'm very excited to
play more of it and experiment more.

The first outfit I earned was the Hunter and I just got the
Stealth one. I think I will try it out a bit. I feel like I'm
going to want to get a Platinum one this game.

In the afternoon, I played for another hour and a half and
repeated one level then did another one again. This game is /so/
much fun!

--

In the evening I played another two hours and did a few more
levels, including one without interacting with any enemies using
the Stealth Suit, which was awesome.  The last level I did, the
Inner Keep, was real tough, especially near the end and making
sure I got all the Seals. One annoying thing was that the
"natural" order to get the scrolls isn't 1, 2, 3, but 2, 1, 3, so
when I got the second, I assumed I had missed the first and did a
lot of wasteful back-tracking.  I got a lot of achievements some
how, but I'm not really sure what I did to get them. This game is
still pretty awesome.

I got the reveal
about who Dust is and I think I am in the final dungeon. I got
some new abilities (double jump), so I went to go do some
exploration and expanded my map a lot. I feel like there will be
one more ability... something to do with Wind and I think I need a
Yellow Resonance Gem.

In the evening I played for another almost two hours and beat the
game. The ending was really epic. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I
feel like the combat has a pretty good flow, it's beautiful, and
there's a lot of neat Metroid-vania style exploration that's fun
to check off. I don't think there's a huge amount of depth to the
combat and I don't feel like going through and getting 100% on
everything, but it was definitely a good experience. I'm struck by
how much time I "lost" to playing on the Hardcore difficulty for
so long. I feel like it wasn't the kind of difficulty I like
though, because there's very little that you can do differently,
or at least it felt that way.

I'm very impressed that it was all made by one guy. Bravo!

Since I just read the book, I was
excited to compare it. There's much more that is different than is
similar. I think the most iconic was thing was the total absence
of the powered armor and the non-elitism of the Mobile
Infantry. But, I could see elements of the book in the movie, but
overall I'd say it was incredibly different.

Something that was a nice surprise was the reference to *REDACTED*ism
in one of the newscasts: "*REDACTED* extremists violated the Arachnid
quarantined and established Port Joe Smith on Planet ??? on to be
destroyed by bugs." There was a pan over a base with a Moroni
statue on it. Very funny.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1997/">1997</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/16/Game--Dust--An-Elysian-Tail--XBLA--2012--3.html">Game: Dust: An Elysian Tail (XBLA, 2012) (4)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/16/">16</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for about an hour today. I decided to drop down to Tough
difficulty because of the annoyances with the combat mentioned
before. After that, in a short time, I was able to clear out most
of the Meadows area and gain 4 levels. This makes me think that
when you are at lower difficulty, you gain levels faster, which is
ridiculous I think. I think you should be rewarded by playing at a
more difficult level. Ugh.
