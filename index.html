I tried using all of my
potions to boost my strength, but I couldn't get his crown off. I
tried many times and utterly failed every time. I am pretty
frustrated that I was able to get down but couldn't do the thing
I needed to so I could actually beat the game. Here's what I spent
my stats on:

700ft - Hardiness
700ft - Exchange Places
700ft - *REDACTED*ge
750ft - Follow-Through
800ft - Opportunist
800ft - Mind Over Body
800ft - Opportunist
850ft - Stealth
950ft - Majesty
1000ft - Dexterity

So, I cheated and recompiled the game to give me tons and tons of
experience when it reloaded the save file. Then I bought every
skill and upgraded my skills a lot. At that point, I just creamed
everyone and walked out. It was very anti-climactic and I didn't
feel like I earned it at all like I would have if I actually made
it out. Although save scumming is technically cheating, it didn't
feel like it because I was gradually unfolding a puzzle. I'm not
sure what I could do better in terms of stats and so on.

I went from 400ft to 650ft. It was
very tense and I had some crazy encounters. I'm learning a lot
about how things in the game work and having a very good time. I
kept track of all the things that I got so I'd remember:

400ft - Stealth 1 -&gt; 3
400ft - Will 3 -&gt; 9
400ft - Inner Light
400ft - Disguise
450ft - Stealth 3 -&gt; 5
450ft - Archery 5 -&gt; 7
450ft - Crowd Fighting
500ft - Assassination
500ft - Stealth 5 -&gt; 6
550ft - Stealth 6 -&gt; 8
550ft - Song 3 -&gt; 6
550ft - Song of Silence
550ft - Vanish
550ft - Keen Senses
600ft - Perception 8
650ft - Listen
650ft - Will 6

I am abusing save states a lot, but I don't feel too bad about it,
because the game is so hard and kind of random in some ways. I
actually like it so much better, because it feels more like a big
puzzle that I'm figuring out how to get through.

My main strategy is to stealth around and if something is worth
fighting (high EXP reward for killing it), then I stealth kill it,
then run away and hide then do it again, or I launch arrows at it
from a distance before kiting again. It is very fun!

I started a game and did extremely well just because I had made
some intelligent decisions about what to do. I used a Faenor with
3/4/4/3 and I made Evasion and Melee both 10. I started to have
backups of my saves too. At 150ft, I got Dodging and Sprinting. At
250ft, I got Lore-Keeper. At 300ft, I got Finesse and enough
Perception so I could get Lore-Master shortly. At 350, I got
Lore-Master. At 350, I also got Zone of Control. 350ft ended up
being a really hard floor with lots of stuff going on. I ended up
getting Flanking too.
