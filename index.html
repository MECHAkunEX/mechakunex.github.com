I went through the whole Temple of Etro
and tried very hard to beat Caius at the end, but it was
incredibly hard and after changing up my strategies a lot, I
decided to go do other things first. Next, I did a few sidequests
around the Wildlands, including meeting Sazh. I went over to the
Dead Dunes and played there most of the rest of the day. I was
able to get through almost everything, I just need to go through
the murals, since I have all the tablets. It's fun to have Fang in
the group, although I kind of wish I could keep the Chocobo around
too. Trying to fight Caius forced me to really push my strategies,
which has made other fights a lot easier and fun.

I felt like I mostly just ran
around the Wildlands as I tried to do the Animal Crossing
minigames to get the Chocobo back to health. I found the Dryads to
be incredibly difficult, because I didn't have any magic equipped
except for Elementa, which healed them. I think I'm getting to the
point in the game where I can't use it anymore because most
enemies are healed by some element. 

I was able to get the Etro village even though I didn't heal my
Chocobo all the way because I tried very hard on the jump. This
let me fight the boss that changes which kind of magic it
absorbs. It was a really hard boss and I died the first time. It
forced me to revise my schemata and I came up with a much more
powerful and diverse combination. My Sentinel role now is
basically impervious because of the hood you get from Snow,
although that means I can't attack all. I think I will compensate
that by adding some buffing or debuffing to it. Then I changed to
a different Ravager setup with a wider variety of spells. I was
able to beat the boss in no time, but when I got back to the
village to turn it in, the leader was gone. Ugh, so annoying.

I took a slight diversion to go see Vanille, which was cool, but I
was surprised that there wasn't more to do on that line. I get a
feeling from that part like Valkyrie Profile where the true way to
"win" the game is do ignore what you're supposed to do and find
some other secret path. I'm doubtful that this game is so
subversive though.

I'm on my way to the Temple of Etro now though. I can't decide if
I'll do Sazh next or go to the Dead Dunes for the first time.

went to the Wild Lands and started working on getting the

I had a cool moment: it was 11:30 and I wanted to get back to
Yusnaan to visit the diviners for noon, but I knew I wouldn't make
it and I had no EP. I fought a Reaver and got 2, so I teleported
and then used Chronostasis and got to the Diviners by 12:01. It
was awesome.

Unfortunately, when I was running through Luxorian, I found
Louise's dead body because I didn't do that quest to completion,
because I was just exploring that area on some downtime for
Yusnaan. I was really annoyed about this because it didn't say
that the quest was time-limited in the menu and I wouldn't have
started it if I knew that either. Bummer.

finished the Third Day, I thought it was weird that even though I
had done a ton of side quests, I didn't get any Yggdrasil
leaves. I suppose only main quest things really count? I don't
know.

I'm getting a lot better at the combat system and I've been
working on better strategies and better specializing my
schemata. I got some really cool weapons from seemingly special
events.

I like the dress-up part of the game a lot and wish that there
wasn't as big of a connection between the powers of an outfit and
what it looks like, because I would want Lightning to wear the
mauve dress all the time, except that I don't like its power set
up.

mail. I was a huge fan of the previous games in the series, so I
was definitely looking forward to this.

The installation process took a long time and I wish I started it
earlier in the day, before I wanted to play. I like that you can
get the Japanese voice-over track, but I don't think I want to use
it, because I'm used to everyone's voices.

The game starts pretty nice and I'm enjoying the battle system. I
think it is a little weird that the added back in the HP meta-game
that was gone in previous FF13s. I find the random battles to be
incredibly easy, but in the graveyard on the main quest, they were
incredibly hard and I had to run from quite a few of them. I hope
that I can go back and train a bit on them.

The time constraint in the game is very oppressive to me, because
it feels like I don't have enough time to do what I want and
definitely not enough to grind. I spent about 8 hours of game time
looking for the final code that I would never have been able to
find because it could only be found in a place that was sealed
during the day. I wish I had used that time to go to one of the
other regions or something.

I'm not finding the customization to be super useful. I've got one
schemata for "Ravager", "Commando", and "Sentinel" each, and then
I'm just optimizing their pieces based on what new things I get. I
feel like I want a little bit more customization and a better
split between the powers I want and the way I want Lightning to
look. I'm sure this will get better as the game progresses, but
it's something I'm noticing now.

I really like the game though!
