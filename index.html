I beat a lot more battles and
explored some more. There are lots of annoying micro-managing
things in the game. For instance, I wish I could just "optimize"
their equipment with a button and I don't like that the two
characters have separate inventories. The game seems designed for
doing Quicksave/load, which feels lame and is too slow. I feel
like there's a huge amount of pressure to pick the right set of
spells, which is maddening because it's so complicated to find
them and keep track of what I want. I am having fun with the game
though, I just feel like it could be way more efficient.

The story is
much more interesting than I remember it being. It's such a weird
thing to jump forward 1,000 years and see what is different and
what is the same. I find Yuna to be super beautiful and I can tell
my Tidus would like her! I don't remember there being so much
oogling of Lulu's breasts.

I have memories of the combat in this game being very interesting,
but so far it is pretty tame and slow. I'm using the Expert sphere
grid and don't have a good idea yet of what my plan will be.

So far the HD remastering is odd... the character animations
really suffer and a lot of the models have low polygons, so it
looks weird for them to be so crisp and high-res. The areas are
also very good looking, but also look very empty and don't have
the many layers that a more modern game would. I'm also amazed
that there's so much loading. For instance, if you are in a
village, you can go into a building instantly, but coming out gets
a loading screen. Weird!?

chapters were pretty awesome. I loved it when Loptr grabbed a meteor
from the sky! I played a little as the extra characters, did a few
Witch Trials, and did the Chapter 14 Halo farming technique so I
could look at the extra costumes.

I feel like this is a much better game than Bayonetta 1, but I
don't have the time and heart to chew it to the bone as I did with
the first game. The combat seems is basically the same, but the
rest of the game is better... the menus are nicer and the
mini-games are much, much better. Like the first one, I never
looked at the lore excerpts that you unlock. I feel like because I
am not as devoted to it, I can't rank it higher than the first
Bayo, but it is definitely up there. I hope to play it again some
day!
