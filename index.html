The concept of this game is really interesting and cool, but the
implementation is pretty bad. The details of fighting are
terrible. Enemies just go near you and you get hit and can get
hit-stun-locked very easily. The exactness of each bite you need
to land is pretty rough too. I think the worst part of the
game... at least what I played... was the ridiculous amount of
grinding you needed to do to get anything. Platformers with
grinding like this are the worst... particularly when it isn't fun
to fight.

the game other than the controls is a bit too messy for my
taste. For example, the larger enemies don't give you any
indication of how damaged they are. It was so bad that I thought
the game was broken during the boss fight. Second, the hit
detection is really bad... you need to be perfectly aligned with
enemies, despite seeing your bullets hit them. Very annoying.

In the credits, I noticed "T. Nomura"... is that Tetsuya?

over, I can watch it. I thought the first episode was fun. I
liked the actors and the action was interesting. I think the two
scientists characters will have to grow on me a little, because I
think they act a little too extreme-to-type. The world it seems
to be creating is neat.

I found a lot of the minor details of the plot to be
obvious---for example, you can't have a guy tell a girl he loves
her (and have her be happy about it) on the first episode, unless
you're going to kill him or cause him to be a bad guy: and they
did both!

I think my only complaint about it is the way "fringe science" is
used as some weird boogey-man discussed in hushed tones, as if
anyone in the real world actually cares about it. It was also
weird that "artificial intelligence" is listed as one of the
fringe science ideas in the beginning. Finally, it's so lazy in
the title sequence that the same terms are repeated and it's not
even trying to depict "moving around a space" where the letters
are.

It's also a little lame that in the very first episode we see
Agent Dunham half-naked in bed and then it's a crucial plot point
that she has to disrobe to her underwear for us to gawk at. It's
especially ridiculous because part of the character background is
that she's not respected by people (who constantly call her
"sweetheart") for being a woman and that she is a particularly
strong woman and defender of woman (in her defense of the raped
women in her past). This is so ridiculous, because in one part of
the show we're supposed to be appalled by the bad behavior of the
men vis-a-vis her gender, but in another part the producers put
us right into their seat.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Fringe/">Fringe</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/04/14/Game--Axelay--SNES--1992--0.html">Game: Axelay (SNES, 1992)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/04/">04</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/04/14/">14</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played through this game in about an hour, using an infinite

On one level, this game is a lot like a shmup, so you'd think that
I would like it a lot, but I didn't. I think the reason I didn't
was that the character was very hard to maneuver, so you felt like
it wasn't your fault you were dying. When I finally died, I had to
fight a boss while clinging to the side of a wall and it felt very
unfair, like I couldn't do anything about it.

hours. I got up through the Wintry Cave.

I remember playing this game when I was a kid and thinking it was
really strange, for a Final Fantasy game, but fine. As I got
older, I thought back on it as being silly and I recognized what a
bad reputation it had with a lot of people. There's this idea that
it was released in the US instead of FF5 and that's it is very
simple and bland.

I see where those people are coming from, because it is definitely
a lot simpler than what came directly before or directly after,
but I'm finding it very enjoyable.

Although it was very clearly designed as "My First RPG", the
things that they did to streamline it are fine and even good. In
fact, it anticipates changes in later Final Fantasy games. For
example:

- The overworld is not a map that you can walk around on (and get
lost) [or find secrets], instead it is a graph of interconnected
nodes. This is just like FF10. The lack of random battles to get
in is compensated with the "battleground" concept, which gives
you an indication of how much you should be grinding and gives a
nice little reward.

- When you die in battle, you can immediately try again from
where your stats were before the battle started. This is like
FF13. Unfortunately, whereas FF13 used this to make every
battle very challenging (combined with the no meta-game), in
FF:MQ the battles aren't particularly tough. (Although the
status effects are common and brutal.)

- Weapons and armor are automatically equipped and you always use
what is best. Except not exactly, because you can change weapons
really simply with the shoulder buttons. I like this because in
FF4, for instance, there's basically only three situations where
you would ever want to not use the best stuff. (1) When you go
to the Dark Elf cave, (2) when you fight the elements and want
to use the right protections, and (3) when you can't afford the
best for everyone and want to control who gets it. This
streamlining is very nice.

- You can save /anywhere/!

- All enemies are visible.

Another thing about the game I'm enjoying is the light action
elements. I associate them a lot with Lufia II, although this game
predates it. It adds a nice bit of variety and fun.

I find the story to very bland, but passable. It's very similar to
the straight-forward-ness of FF1 or Zelda, but with a few fun
dialogue choices and elements.

going forward. Furthermore, I really notice the environmental
dodging mechanics of these Gradius-style games and don't like it.

the hotel and couldn't get out. I could understand enough of the
Japanese to read the menus and some of the dialogue like "Kunio
went up in level!" but I didn't understand what I was supposed to
do. The game is a lot slower paced in the combat than River City
Ransom, so it wasn't as exciting. I read online that they dropped
the shopping part and it is more like an open-world beat-em up
with RPG-style levels, rather than choives in what you learn,
etc. It doesn't sound as exciting.
