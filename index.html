An interesting quote regarding the idea that alcohol was used
historically to prove manhood: "This one-time well-populated
Island, the misty Isle of Skye, still has one of the finest of the
famous old castles, that belonging to the Dunvegan clan. It
participated in the romantic life of Prince *REDACTED*lie. The castle
equipment still boasts the grandeur of a past glory. Among the

The first chapter was very uninformative as it rehearsed old
rhetoric and statistics that are clearly no longer relevant.

Although his travel details in chapter two are cute, it is the
classic example of "what I did last summer" writing that is a sign
of an amateur scientist.

His main point seems to be that these Swiss kids work very hard and
eat primarily bread, milk, and cheese with meat on occasion. In
contrast, the other Swiss kids had "modern" diets of refined
flours, sweets, canned goods, sweetened fruits, chocolate and
reduced use of dairy products. At this point his focus is on their
worse teeth and susceptibility to tuberculosis.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1939/">1939</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/05/06/Game--Final-Fantasy-5--SNES--1992--6.html">Game: Final Fantasy 5 (SNES, 1992) (7)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/05/">05</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/05/06/">06</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for about an hour and a half.
