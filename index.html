because they were criticizing the game for things they praise
games like Demon's Souls about. Furthermore, they were ignoring
the instructions the game said then running around in circles
rather than looking at the map and exploring. It was very
frustrating to listen to them.

--

I played today for about three hours. I basically did nothing
(slept for 14 hours and then 18 hours) on the 12th and 13th days,
because I had nothing to do. On the 13th day, I did the Ultimate
Lair, but only had two enemies to kill. It took about three tries
with different techniques to kill Ereshigal. It was pretty cool. I
got 5 stars in 4'22" but died three times (two Phoenix Downs and
one Arise). It was cool.

When I got to the final Outfitters, I couldn't buy every garb, so
I did some grinding on the Anubys to get the Nightmare garb. I got
80k gil and then pushed forward. I'll probably beat the game
today.

chunks. In the first chunk I finished my exterminations, killing
off the Hoplites in the Yusnaan factory, then the Zomoks, and
Dreadnoughts in Luxerion and then I went to the palace in Yusnaan
for the Skata'ne. 

This allowed me to complete all the Canvas of Prayers. I spent the
next chunk of time gathering Soul Seeds in the Luxerion bridge
area and got the Elixir. Thus, I was able to do everything except
Luka and Aeronite by the end of the 11th day.

In the in-between sequence of days 11 and 12, it was interesting
to see LRFF13 so clearly reveal that it would eventually return to
the Ur-JRPG and be about killing God. The first game was kind of
like that too, because you kill the "fal'Cie God", but by that
time you had learned that they weren't really God-like. In
contrast, Lightning wants to kill Bhunivelze while believing that
he really did make the world.

On the beginning of the 12th day, I went and fought Aeronite. It
took a few tries with different strategies and paying close
attention to which buttons I mapped the various actions too. (For
instance, make sure to put the -ara spell on the same button in
each schemata.) I did it by abusing Overclock and had to use a
Phoenix Wing, Crusader Potion, Nektar of the Gods, and two
Ethers. It felt like an okay expense, because supposedly he's the
hardest enemy. It was a very tense 6'30" but I was happy to do it.

After that, I went to the Wildlands and Yusnaan to buy some
weapons that I read about on forums that would be useful for
Aeronite: the +1300 STR weapon from Yusnaan, the ATB shields from
the Research Camp, and the ultra magic weapons from Jagd. This was
the first time I spent any money at forges in the whole game---and
I only have two bosses to go! I spent a lot of money though. I
went from 1.5 mil gil to about 90k.

Then I went to Lux to do the final conversation with Luka. I got
there around 3pm and had nothing to do, so I just went to sleep
for an hour until she appeared. I now have literally nothing left
to do until I go to the Omega Dungeon and final sequence of the
game. I wonder if I should grind for money to prep for upgrading
in NG+?

Finally, I was struck today that the dress-up mechanics of this
game are very similar to Resonance of Fate. This is funny because
RoF was made by Tri-Ace, which worked on FF13-2. And, RoF was
released almost the same day as FF13-1 and is perceived to have
bombed in its shadow. It's interesting that FF13 returned to and
borrowed stuff from that game. I really liked RoF, btw.
