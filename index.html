missions. This game is *awesome*. The combat system flows really
well and the Demon/Angel weapon system is a very cool way to do
it. I'm very excited about using the pull towards/pull to system
during combat. I love it when an ability is useful in traversal
and combat---the best things in Metroidvanias is when the
abilities aren't just "keys", but have many uses.

The style of the game is really neat. I like that everything isn't
static and seems to be alive and reacting to you. The words that
appear all over the scenery when you get attacked is super cool
too. The opening of the game was particularly ridiculous.

I don't like how much vulgarity there is in the game though. It
makes me feel like I can't play it as much, because I normally
play games around my little kids. I guess I'll have to keep it for
when they're asleep.

I was so impressed with my first two hours with the game, I feel
like I want to do everything possible in the game and play all the
difficulty levels. We'll see how I feel after I beat it once
though :) I was a little nervous when I started though, because I
wasn't super impressed with the previous game and had never played
a Ninja Theory game, but I was still interested from the Giantbomb
Quick Look and discussion I'd heard.

It was basically
just two boss fights. Since I had never used any Gold Skulls or
any healing items the entire game, it was easy to just use them
and push through the boss fights, although they were still a
little hard. I liked fighting during the Credits roll. I was also
impressed with the large number of unlocks that I got at the end
of the game.

Overall, I found the game enjoyable but not especially amazing. I
can imagine having loved it when it came out and wanting to play
through every possible mode, like I did with Bayonetta, but I
think it is out-classed by Bayonetta generally, so I don't think
I'll do that now. In particular, I found that I was able to limit
myself to a pretty simple strategy and make it through the whole
game---whereas in Bayo I had to modify my strategy as I got
further along. 

However, the game definitely got harder, but it was more about
complicated boss patterns, etc, rather than asking for you to
change your core skills. As a simple example, I stayed with the
starting weapons and style the entire game without much need for
change---just a few instances of using a better weapon for a
particular weakness.

14, Att 10, End 10, Str 11, Dex 11, Res 10, Int 9, and Faith 11.

I'm not sure which gift I should get. Basically everything but the
Tiny Being's Ring seems useless. And then maybe try to get Ring of
Favour and Protection plus the Coranthy Ring to optimize Stamina.

As far as weapons go, if I two-hand then I can use Str 16
things. I think the Reinforced Club is supposed to be the best
choice.

--

Later in the day I played for another two hours and got to Mission
19 (the one after the boss rush.) I think that means I'm basically
done because there's supposed to be 20 levels.

I found the boss fight against the Lady to be really annoying
because she moves around so much, but also not hard because I was
able to just use the Trickster teleport to close in on her very
fast.

I liked the Doppleganger fight a lot. It was cool to use something
in the environment to make them vulnerable and try to goad them to
go near it.

techniques. This game feels like you have to be very lucky with
the moves and incredibly quick with your dash and movement. There
just isn't enough time to use normal movement and there's no

enjoyable... although it doesn't feel as good as Bayonetta :)

one. I played as Dante (no idea about what's the deal with other
character.) At first, the game feels a lot better. It moves faster
and the mechanics feel tighter. Just being able to clearly see
what enemy you are targeting and see their health bar go down
makes the game feel much nicer. However, the game felt like a
back-and-forth between boring and exploitable enemies and nigh
impossible challenges.

For instance, in Mission 5 there's a sequence with giant Tanks. If
you just slowly circle-strafe them then they can't hurt you at
all, but they soak up a TON of damage from your shotgun. Similarly
with the Chopper a bit later... it can't hit you if you just hang
out under it, but it takes a ton of hits. I finally had enough of
the game when I got to the next section where you have to climb up
a burning building with ridiculously awkward platforming controls.

I can definitely see how this game was the "true form" of what
they realized they wanted to do after making the first game, but
it still wasn't appealing enough for me.

I've
heard a lot about this from my love of Bayonetta.

In the first three missions, I found it to be a pretty bad
game. It definitely feels like it was originally a Resident Evil
game, with the fixed, stuffy camera angles and the awkward
"adventure game" tropes throughout the castle.

I don't find the combat to be very fluid and I feel like it's
impossible to dodge at all, which means there's almost no
"finesse" to combat. It reminds me of a traditional 2D brawler
where the key is not to dodge, but to evenly spread out your
attacks against a lot of enemies to keep from getting
surrounded. It's definitely a coherent design, but I can't say I
really enjoy it.

The boss battle in the third mission was ridiculous. It felt like
you couldn't hit the thing at all. Eventually, I looked at a FAQ
and it said to dodge, but you can't really move quickly and then
whenever you try to move around the camera angle changes on you so
you turn around. It is infuriating. In the end, I just tried to
spam jump on its back over and over. I'm kind of amazed that I was
able to beat it the time that I did, because it didn't feel any
different on my part from before. I died maybe... 10 times and did
a few different reloads before I won. I felt like just quitting
and saying the game wasn't for me. But since I won, I guess I will
keep going. I'm not excited about it though.

I find the need to hold R1 to use the gun to be very annoying. I
can appreciate its unique "stick shift"-like quality, but it
doesn't feel beautiful or good to me.

it again, I just think of all the tedious parts that I will have
to do again and how I *know* that I will win all the

--

Later, I started the new file and went through the Kaine dream
sequences that happen right away. It was neat. Then I just watched
the ending videos on YouTube. Since I played with the voices off
the whole time, it was really weird to hear the voices on the
videos.

After watching the videos and reading the NIER Wiki, I was
surprised at some of the details of the story. Some of it I
gathered from my play through, but it was much more clear
(obviously) reading and watching these things.

Overall, I thought this game was really cool. The battle system is
so traditional at first glance, but then becomes very unique as
you start getting into the "bullet hell" boss fights. Very cool.

I got
up to the part where you go to the military base. The game is so
weird. It feels like it came from another planet. The introduction
is so abrupt and a lot of the dialogue is incredibly bizarre. The
mechanics are really odd too. Obviously there's the weird fishing
game, which I totally failed at.

But, the most interesting thing to me is when a battle scene pulls
out to an almost 2D perspective and it feels like a bullet hell
shooter where you have to weave your way through geometric
patterns. The boss inside the military base was really cool in
that way.

The style of the game is exceedingly odd too. The main character
is so ugly. The girl Kaine is such a cliche, it feels like
pandering, but then the characters acknowledge that she's
pandering. It's weird. I was really annoyed that I just turned on
the game and within seconds heard almost every cuss word
around. I've been playing with the voice volume off, but haven't
actually heard anything bad.

I get the feeling that there's a huge amount of content I'm
missing by not being meticulous enough with the environments and
quests. I feel like every shop has stuff that appears useless and
is definitely too expensive to be worthwhile.

I am really annoyed at how far all the places I need to go between
are. It would be different if it were a normal RPG where you were
gaining power through the fights, but the progression in this game
seems incredibly slow. Not only are you gain levels very slowly,
but I feel like gaining a new level never matters.

It feels like the game defies you at every step and is just a
stumbling block. It's bizarre.

My final comment for the day... it is totally absurd that there
are two versions of this game in Japan and that the character
design is a Western cliche. I think the Japanese one looks a lot
better.

I first recharged my SP
by fighting basic monsters in the Castle. Then, I fought the final
boss. Debilitate was great and Trumpeter is immune to most
attacks, so it was awesome.

The true ending is neat... especially all the new character
outfits, especially Naoto's since she never wore female clothes
before.

It's kind of amazing that it is exactly three months since I
started the game. I think that's too long to play the same game
though. I definitely liked it a lot, but I was a bit worn out by
the end.

I still need to watch the TV listings, but I won't count that as
play time.... they weren't that interesting.
