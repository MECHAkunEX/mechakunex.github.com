Her actions with the
disease seem so foolish and she's lost another company of
soldiers. Everything is gathering around to destroy her. "It is
known."

I wonder if we will hear from Jeyne's perspective. Her plea to him
is so pathetic. "Jeyne, it rhymes with pain." is a scary
foreshadowing. I like what we know that he does not: Bran spoke to
him and that the singer is Mance. The lady who is suspicious of
Maesters reminds me of what we know about them from AFFC.

The Dornish chapter was a nice refresher for what is going on over
there. I wonder what will happen when Myrcella meets Swan. The plan
to kill Tristan is interesting, especially compared to the book,
which is totally different. The rumor Doran hears of the Golden
Company will be a surprise to him. I assume he'll support Young
Griff when he shows up, but it will be surprising.

Jon's chapter is very cool. I like him using Val as an emissary to
Tormund and how detailed all his plans are with the Freefolk. It is
really cool how he's learning to talk to Wun Wun and how he has
basically no more animosity towards them. In contrast, the other
leading men of the Night's Watch are very prideful about their
positions before the Watch. Their resentment is a lot deeper, I
think, than in the show. It is clear that Bran was warning him that
they would try to kill him. The Hardhome rescue is coming up, too!

Tyrion riding the pig and interacting with Penny is a bit silly. I
feel like this whole sequence, and indeed a lot of other parts in
the book, is meant to emphasize how difficult travel is in a world
like this. The show doesn't do that at all.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/09/21/Game--Mushihimesama-Futari-Black-Label--Arcade--2007--38.html">Game: Mushihimesama Futari Black Label (Arcade, 2007) (39)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2018/">2018</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2018/09/">09</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2018/09/21/">21</a></span></span><pre class="content">T O 2B  53,785,642

I felt
like as soon as we learned that Manderly was treating Davos well,
it meant that he would join Stannis' side. I love the whole "The
North Remembers" thing and I think that it is cool that Wex has
come back. I don't get the reference for where Rickon is, but I
think it is a cool plot to go get him.

Dany's situation is so dire and I feel like there's basically no
escape for her. Hizdar is totally untrustworthy too.

I really enjoyed hearing Melissandre's perspective. Her vision was
awesome... she's seeing Dany. Her comment that she prays for a
vision of Azor Ahai but only sees Snow is great. The daggers in the
night is sad and prophetic. I think that the boy with the wolf's
face must be Bran and the wooden man is the three-eyed raven. It's
cool that she doesn't need food and that she has turned Mance into
Rattle Shirt. A lot more magic than previously. I wonder what will
happen trying to get Jeyne...

Lord Bolton's comment to Reek about saying "m'lord" was a nice port
to Tywin during his time with Arya. It's sad that he knows Ramsay
will kill his sons. That kind of thoughtfulness doesn't fit with
his show character.

Tyrion's "blah blah" during the red prayer was awesome. It's kind
of odd for him to have this little history lesson about other
little people. Valyria is so neat to hear about too.

Oh man, Bran's chapter was so awesome. I love him being a raven and
learning about how ravens really did used to speak. The whole room
full of other enthroned children was cool. His thought about how
men would be "mad" not "sad" at having their time go away is very
apt. The tree visions of the Winterfell Godswood was cool.

It is neat that Jon has got some wildlings to actually join the
Watch and that there's now a Giant on the team. His observation
about the "realms of men" and seeing all the different tribes of
Freefolk and Westerosi gathered together as "men" was very cool.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/09/20/Game--Mushihimesama-Futari-Black-Label--Arcade--2007--37.html">Game: Mushihimesama Futari Black Label (Arcade, 2007) (38)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2018/">2018</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2018/09/">09</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2018/09/20/">20</a></span></span><pre class="content">T O 3   93,763,389

I like learning about how the
Golden Company works and it was cool to see Aegon come into his own
and make a decision, although notice that he does what Tyrion tells
him he should. (Just like Jon is following the Tyrion in his head.)
Griff having grey scale is an interesting twist!

Quentin's story is cool. I like all the weird oddities of the
soldiers and how un-martial the slavers are. The ridiculous rumors
about Dany are great. Their luck in being commanded to turn cloak
was great.

Asha's chapter is very bawdy. She is just floundering around not
knowing what to do. It is hilarious that Euron had a seal stand in
for her at the wedding he staged. I'm surprised that she doesn't
realize that she can use Theon to contest the Kingsmoot as was in
the past. I think it is clear that she's been captured by Stannis
and that he followed Jon's advice.

I like that the red priests are on Dany's side but everyone else in
power is opposed. It is so cool that Tyrion is so knowledgeable
about people from Westeros that he recognizes Jorah. I like Jorah's
comment that Tyrion can "count his crimes until morning." "Mereen"
and "Volantis is waiting" are great ways to end the chapter.

Jon's chapter is quite melancholy for him. It's important to
remember that he has no idea that it is not Arya.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/09/19/Game--Mushihimesama-Futari-Black-Label--Arcade--2007--36.html">Game: Mushihimesama Futari Black Label (Arcade, 2007) (37)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2018/">2018</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2018/09/">09</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2018/09/19/">19</a></span></span><pre class="content">T O 3B 121,946,867

I like his
conclusion: "If you want to conquer the world, best have dragons."
Hah.

Davos' hearing of all the news really brings home how poor reliable
communication is at this time. It is really hard to remember that
the characters don't know everything we do as the audience. His
decision to go visit the lord is very noble of him.

I was surprised to see Xaro appear again and Jorah mentioned as
well. The whole concept of sex to music as a form of dance is very
GRRM.

Jon's situation is so dire. I like learning the mechanics of how
they keep food at the castle. His advice to Stannis is so good, you
can really see how great a decision it is for him to be in
command. I like that he gets the Wildlings given to him so that he
can save them. Very noble!

Tyrion's interaction with Stone Men was a little bit too timely for
when they are threat to him. I like the way he reveals that he
knows who Griff and Young Griff are, although I don't really like
it because now Dany isn't just not-first-in-line, but actually
she's second behind bother Young Griff and Jon.

Davos' argument with the court is awesome. The audacity of the
claim that Robb turned into a wolf and killed everyone is so
ridiculous. I love that he offers the lord, "The chance to do your
duty." Boom.

Reek's internal musings about how he's been beaten is so
intense. The idea that he's constantly "remembering" his name and
forgetting his real identity is so intense. I like that he
recognizes who Jeyne really is.

It is neat that Free Folk are carving faces in the south, but it
makes me feel like we should have heard about some sort of
shamanistic leadership structure. Jon is so good at understanding
everyone's position around him and it sucks that he can't make
anyone happy. I love his conclusion about what will happen when a
free woman kills a brother that tries to rape her.

The further details about how Aegon survived was cool. Tyrion's
advice to Griff is obviously awesome and he has such a great
understanding of who Dany must really be despite never having met
her. I was very surprised for him to run into Jorah, because so
much of that plot line was merged with Jorah in the show, I assumed
it wasn't going to happen that way at all.

Dany has so much more of a reason to get married in the book and I
like her going through all the options. I'm surprised she hasn't
made it happen with Dario yet. The show doesn't do a good job
making him seem terrible like she sees him in the book. His line
about "better the butcher than the meat" is great.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/09/18/Game--Mushihimesama-Futari-Black-Label--Arcade--2007--35.html">Game: Mushihimesama Futari Black Label (Arcade, 2007) (36)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2018/">2018</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2018/09/">09</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2018/09/18/">18</a></span></span><pre class="content">T O 2   66,612,163

Dany is so down on herself in this chapter and it is so sad that
she puts the dragons in chains... what a bad idea!

Reek's chapter is really depressing. His internal perspective makes
his beatings and punishments seem way way worse.

Bran's chapter is really cool. I like that ravens talking to him
and the way he controls Hodor. Hearing the Child of the Forest talk
about herself and her experiences is awesome too. Jojen dying was a

Jon's scenes are great. I love the impact of the "Kill The Boy"
advice and how he deals with Janus. He really gives Janus a lot of
time and opportunity to repent.

I feel like Tyrion thinks that Griff is a specific person from
Westeros, but I have no idea who it is supposed to be. Young Griff
is yet another suitor for Dany.

I am confused about the timeline of these books, especially for
Davos, because the last I recall, he is supposed to be dead, but
maybe that happens in the future? I like that he brought up the

best ever. The first Original run had the best stages 1 and 3,
while the second had a great stage 2. On my second run, I was
entering the third boss fight with all of my bombs and all of my
lives. I spent them very quickly though and got hosed.

Thorne. I love that Brienne is good but not perfect in her
fighting. I love that she immediately offers her service and how
Sansa accepts in such a humble circumstance. I'm surprised there
is no consequence at all for the Dornish guards and it seems
implausible that the Sand Snakes could get to King's Landing so
quickly. "It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore." "I want to
see what the world looks like when she's done conquering it." I
feel like Melissandre is checking to see if the Lord of the Light
is really real after being disappointed by Jon's death. I don't
get the impression she does this every night.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/09/16/Book--A-Game-of-Thrones--by-George-R--R--Martin--1996--24.html">Book: A Game of Thrones, by George R.

The
demonstration of the spies was very cute.

I love how Jon decided to befriend Sam based on listening to advice
from Tyrion. There's a very real way in which Tyrion is such the
hero of the whole series.

Ned can learn the secret so much quicker than he does. I suppose
everything is clear when you know what to look for though.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1996/">1996</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
