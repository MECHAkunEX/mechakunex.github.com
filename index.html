  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game sooo much when I was a kid. I enjoyed
beat-em-ups and this one in particular to play with friends.</p>

<p>I played tonight for the whole first level and then died on the
boss. It was incredibly rote and there weren&#8217;t even exciting
graphics or satisfying punching like in Streets of Rage. I feel
like this genre of game is so easy to replace with better
versions that put all the old ones to shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game in two chunks today. I saw the Encyclopedia
Bombastica entry about it and thought it looked neat.</p>

<p>In my first chunk, I played for about an hour and got to
stage 4. I played the first stage maybe ten times before I was
able to do anything. The game has a steep learning curve in terms
of controlling your mecha and understanding how weak the mecha
is. The key seems to be going very slowly, so that you can
recharge. I feel like it is reminiscent, in a way, to a game like
Vanquish, where it is essential to stay with your squad.</p>

<p>In my second chunk, I played for a bit more than an hour and beat
it. The story was mildly interesting and the final levels seemed
easier because you had more stuff, but still challenging.</p>

<p>I think the hardest level was the first low-gravity one where you
had to defend the ships and then get into one of them by the
end. I couldn&#8217;t guard them effectively, but I realized that if I
kept one off-screen, I could continually dodge and then get into
at the last second without it being destroyed.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the game once I got into it. The chunky feel of
the game felt purposeful and interesting. The aiming system that
encouraged you to stay still was neat. The progression system was
a nice touch.</p>

<p>I think my only really problem was that most of the weapons had
such limited ammo, that I conserved them to the point of never
using them. I used the spread shot a few times in the
beginning. I used the grenade launcher once. Once I got the
missile pods, I used them to defeat the last few bosses. I think
the game could have been better by having a different special
weapon system. For example, you could decide between different
shapes and then the other weapons would be power-ups that you&#8217;d
have to find in the level and they might be permanent after that,
or have a time-limit (so you are compelled to blast with them.)
Or, they could have made it so it was essential to use them, so
you had to figure out to use them properly. As it was, they felt
so valuable that I never experimented with them enough to learn
how they worked.</p>

<p>Another thing that could have been better was providing another
way to deal with enemies that were incredibly close to you. There
were many times when I was just covered and enemies and couldn&#8217;t
do anything because the bullets appeared on the screen passed the
mob. Perhaps a melee weapon would have been the trick?</p>

<p>In any case, this was a very fun game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for maybe 10 rounds. Each time I could barely
register a few hits on the target. It&#8217;s an incredibly bizarre
game. It&#8217;s kind of a 2D platforming action game, but with an
incredibly small arena and horrific controls. Definitely not a
winner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game until the boss of the third stage. I used one
continue on the first stage getting to know the systems; I used
another at the beginning of stage two and stage three; then I got
to the boss of stage three and died. Stage three was incredibly
painful on the eyes because the background scroll so much.</p>

<p>The game was a very competent shooter from that era, with the
standard complaints for someone that loves CAVE. The idea that you
are person is kind of cute and the rotating options are neat
too. But, the game doesn&#8217;t have enough distinctive to feel
special.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for about 30 minutes. It took me 5 minutes to
get passed level 1, then I spent the rest of the time in the next
level. I got no keys at all and could barely make any progress.</p>

<p>This game is so brutal. Nemo can&#8217;t really jump over enemies, even
if he has stunned them with candy. Most of the animals have no
ability to hurt the enemies. It&#8217;s so hard but you have no ways to
deal with it. It&#8217;s not fun, despite the concept being great and
the general premise of turning into lots of different animals
sounds like it would be great. But, it doesn&#8217;t follow through
enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this and got to Area 5 on one continue. (There are 8
levels.) My score was 1,997,270 points. This is one of those old
shmups (I think of them as of the &#8220;Solider&#8221; archetype) where if
you die then you are totally screwed because you lose all your
power-ups. In this round, but Area 3, I had literally everything
you could get (there&#8217;s a store to buy stuff and it tells you when
there isn&#8217;t anything to get), and was stomping on everything. But
then I lost it at the end of Area 4, then spammed bombs on the
boss and then spent a few continues trying and failing to get
past Area 5.</p>

<p>There were a lot of cute graphics&#8230; really weird stuff but not
&#8220;cute&#8221; like Parodius, more just bizarre. That was fun to look at,
but the mechanics weren&#8217;t worth trying again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for about 45 minutes. I&#8217;d never really played it
before and I just assumed it was exactly the same as Tetris. But
it&#8217;s much more complex and incredibly challenging.</p>

<p>I got to Level 8 with a score of 30,600.</p>

<p>During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense
pressure. The game board is so claustrophobic and you feel like
no decision is the right one. It&#8217;s so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.</p>

<p>My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She&#8217;s amazing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a brilliant movie. All the cameos, references, and jokes
related to video games were lots of fun. The story was pretty cute
too. I saw it with my two kids and they enjoyed it a lot. I liked
the music a lot, especially the AKB48 song.</p>

<p>The short at the beginning of the movie was beautiful and made me
cry. =)</p>

started off with this one&#8230; way it is unbelievably

game like Gran Turismo&#8230; and obviously it utterly fails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve heard a lot about this game and I thought it would be an
awesome action game like Ninja Gaiden, but with bigger and more
beautiful graphics. I was totally wrong. This is super boring and
the giant sprites do the gameplay a great dis-service by
preventing you from seeing enough of the screen to do anything
really effectively. I did not enjoy it.</p>
