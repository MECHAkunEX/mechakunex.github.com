on some assists and did the race perfectly. I can't decide if I
will keep doing it with them on.

Later in the day I played for another hour and did the Classic

hard.

Later in the day I did another 45 minutes and did the three 5
minute races with the Focus ST. They were pretty fun. It's nice to
get into the zone on a particular track and car then do it over
and over again.

If I keep at this pace (11% in 8 hours) then I will play for 75
hours, which sounds too low. It's also interesting to me how much
money I've made. It seems like a lot since I haven't had to buy
more than one car yet.

I recently watched a video of GT5. It's amazing how much faster
loading GT6 is.
