I read up past the Introduction today, which means I just read the
rhetorical preview of what is covered without reading any of the
details. When I was vegan, I read lots of stuff like this about
how wonderful primitive diets were, especially with regards to
teeth. I'm interested in learning the details.

The introduction was very funny with its discussion of how the
bones in the head were affected by nutrition and in turn affected
brain development.

I did a little bit more social stuff, including getting my stats

about half of my overall job planning goals. I still had about
half left and a total of about 1000 ABP left to get. I calculated
my ABP efficiency:
- Always get 4 or 8 ABP per fight
- Always win every fight because Galuf has highest speed and can
always cast Lvl 5 Doom
- Can do 8 fights for every use of a Cabin to get back MP
- A Cabin costs 600 GP
- Each fight gives 1014 GP or 2535 GP
- Each fight gives 50 XP or 125 XP

This means that every cycle of fights, I get, assuming equal
numbers of two statue and five statue fights:
- 48 ABP
- 13596 GP
- 700 XP

Since this process has no risk, it is essentially an arbitrage
opportunity in the game to get infinite resources.

This means that it would take about 21 cycles to get all my ABP
requirements satisfied. I would also net 285k GP and 14700 XP. This
would only bring me up two levels (I'm 25 now), which is not a
significant source of XP. It's also about double my gold.  I
estimate that this would take about four hours to do, based on
getting about 500 ABP in two hours.

When there are situations like this in a game, I wish it were
possible to give the game a proof or a program that it was possible
for me to get the resources, so I didn't have to actually spend my
time to it. It seems wrong to spend my valuable time on such
things.

Putting all this together, I decided to dump the SRAM from my
PowerPak and then wrote a program to adjust my total ABP to
expedite this process. It was a little complicated to find where
they were stored and then adjust the checksums. (The key was that
the SNES is little endian.) Implementing the program and running it
took about an hour and a half... which is still a time win.

After doing this, I got all my ABP, but didn't get any of the XP or
the GP. Although this is definitely not "allowed" in the game, I
consider it a fair trade that doesn't compromise the integrity of
my play-through too much.

I then switch to Freelancers, got my Abilities all in line, and
then got the equipment from the store that I wanted. (Nice thing:
The chain whip is the most powerful weapon I have available right
now and it is also usable from the back row!)

This whole process took 8 minutes of game time, which I will count,
and about an hour and a half of programming time.

and shares with FF6. I love their song.

Next, I got to Galuf's castle and spent a lot of time grinding in

Galuf's world. I still haven't really ventured outside the first
few jobs, because I'm focusing on mastering them. Most of the jobs
that seem exciting, like Dragoon, aren't really that good when you
read the details about them.

Some of the bosses in this game are really finicky with the random
number generator. For example, the boss of the Ancient *REDACTED*rary
creamed me the first four times, then when I prepared a new
strategy, he never even attacked! He just used status effects and
didn't make use of them.

Something annoying about this game (and almost all other RPGs)
after playing Mystic Quest is that you can't jump over people who
are in your way!

When I learned about Butz' history, it was a little to awkward
for his dad to yell, "Stella!"

Finally, after getting the airship, I found it very confusing what
I was supposed to do... I just wandered around trying to find new
places to go... eventually I accidentally discovered you had to go
/back/ to the ruins.

I think next time I play I'll have to grind a little, because I'm
finding the random battles taking too much out of me.

and the PowerPak. This game was the first translation I ever heard
of or tried to play. I have a distinct memory of playing it when I
was very young on an early (bad) emulator with a bad PC
controller. When I played again, I remembered up until the ship
graveyard, but nothing really after that, even though I know I
played further.

The game is really interesting when compared to FF4 and FF6. It
really is just between them in lots of different ways and there's
a lot of shared content. For example, the graphics and art assets
between FF4 and FF6 are totally different, but I can see
sprites/etc in FF5 that are in both. (Examples: The mountains in
FF5 are used in FF6. The werewolf and dragon sprites are also
shared. Some of the monsters, in battle, are the same as FF4.)
Overall, I'd say that the overworld/map looks more like FF6 but
the UI/in-battle art looks more like FF4.

There are some convenience things that are more like one or the
other too. For example, you can "optimize" your equipment, but you
can't see if a weapon in a store is going to be better or
worse. Also, the L/R buttons don't switch between characters in
the menu sub-screens... which is really inconvenient.

Another interesting thing is to think about the characters... in
FF4 you have 5 characters at a time and a very large cast with
detailed interactions that cause them to move in and out of the
party. In FF6, its the same, but with only 4 at a time. FF5 is
totally different. You immediately get the 4 characters and they
never change. Furthermore, I find them to be relatively
blank-slate characters compared to those in FF4/6, and not only
because the job system makes them so flexible.

Finally, there are interesting references. The first one is that
in FF5e, you can let "Lone Wolf", a thief, out of jail. He, of
course, shows up in FF6.

--

On the actual game, I really like it. The story is fun and the
combat system is great. The job system is cool, especially the
beautiful sprites for each job. (I also like it how when a
character is downed in battle, they lose their outfit, like it was
a magical super-hero costume.) The system is quite overwhelming
though, it feels like it is really easy to make a bad choice with
what to do.

I played for a little less than seven hours and got up the Ancient
*REDACTED*rary. The only time I needed to grind was to beat Shiva.

My wife and I
were blown away by the actors abilities to act and sing so well
together. The lyrics and songs were great. My favourite part of the
concept is that there's no normal dialogue... it is all song.

The only bad part was how much of it was based on stupid people and
their stupid, brash decisions. I thought the majority of the
"emotional" scenes were signs of bad morals and ideas, so it was
hard to be very touched by them. The most moving part of the film
is when Jean Valjean is helped by the Bishop of Digne. Fantine's "I
Dreamed a Dream" was very powerful, but stupid overall.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/04/19/Game--Cybernator--SNES--1992--0.html">Game: Cybernator (SNES, 1992)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/04/">04</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/04/19/">19</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this for about forty-five minutes. It is pretty awesome,
but very difficult. The controls are particularly hard because
it's very floaty with rocket pack. I found it very frustrating,
but overall I really enjoyed the game. I think it would be better
for me to play this on an emulator, so I could take each challenge
on its own... even though that's pretty cheesy. I was able to make
it the third part of level 3, but just couldn't preserve my health
very well.
