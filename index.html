Once you get Agni, the
game stops being challenging, because the form just destroys
everything. I fought most of the final battles on "Auto", only
stopping occasionally to use a Cure item. The ending of the game
is fun though. I think the other big problem with the game is that
the entire magic system is almost totally useless. I barely ever
cast attack spells with anyone and only with Bleu
occasionally. Similar, Nina only used her healing, reviving (just
a few times), and fortifying (just a few times) and never needed
to use the others. The game is definitely fun though... the plot
is simple but entertaining enough. The characters are memorable,
especially because of the "fable" quality of them being talking
animals.

quality in that tiny actions by the "bad guys" would have prevented
the things that happened to them. I think that the medical bay
devices were poorly explained as to why the normal people of Earth
can't use them. I rationalized it as being expensive to run and
people being concerned with overpopulation, but the movie never
attempts to explain it. I really enjoyed the beginning as Max has
to deal with the robots, it takes the unkindness of police and
bureaucrats to the extreme to have them literally robotic.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/11/15/Movie--The-Wolverine--starring-Hugh-Jackman--2013--0.html">Movie: The Wolverine, starring Hugh Jackman (2013)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/11/">11</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/11/15/">15</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a fun movie.

Once
the bad guys appeared, it started to go down hill as it reveled in
gore a bit too much and lost its heady/intellectual base. I think
it really totally falls apart when they get back to their home
colony and it becomes a giant fight. They even make sure that the
cannibals never speak and were black masks, so that you dehumanize
them and treat them like zombies/animals.

The movie shows that it totally lost its soul in the final line
when Sam says that there is only one rule left: Survive. The
problem with this is that it goes against what the movie is about:
the fact that cannibalism is never okay and you shouldn't do it,
even though it could help you survive. Unless, of course, they
meant it in some deep way where Sam has had his evilness unlocked
by smashing off the head of the bad guy, but I doubt that.

After looking at the Wikipedia page, I was impressed by the super
small budget.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/11/06/Game--Breath-of-Fire--SNES--1993--2.html">Game: Breath of Fire (SNES, 1993) (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/11/">11</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/11/06/">06</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for about three hours tonight.

The Gold Town is very funny because their houses really do have
awesome stuff to steal and it's the only place where you can get
in trouble for taking stuff from their houses.

I feel like the Nina "massage" sequence must have been censored
from the Japanese.
