enemies so much easier than the Wildlands mega enemies. I don't
have a lot more enemies to destroy and I only have a few quests
left. The main thing that's not obvious how to do is getting Soul
Seeds for the Elixir.

I still enjoyed it, but some cliches
appear to be coming out that drag it down a little. For instance,
the writer writing about a writer writing a book is becoming a bit
thicker; the son being the best kid in the school is too perfect;
the father losing his brother in an undisclosed way; and, finally
at the end of chapter 13, he ends with the school doing something
slightly sinister. I would expect the book to more powerful and
interesting if the school is totally on the level, but it was just
a story about the regret and growing up-angst that the father
feels.

Another thing that bugs me so far is that the father doesn't seem
to be concerned about how the son feels about the
school. Apparently, they've had regular interaction because they
talk about quarterly visits and how Christopher wasn't needy. But
how would Christopher feel about leaving the school? Presumably he
feels alienation for the same reasons that the father feels
longing. I know that when I was young, I wouldn't appreciate being
pulled out of what I like to satisfy my dad's need for family
time. In fact, I /know/ that I would dislike it, because I did
dislike it when it really happened to me. I hope that the book
explores these issues and the son isn't just a McGuffin.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2014/">2014</a></li></ul></div><div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2014/02/20/Game--Lightning-Returns--Final-Fantasy-XIII--PS3--2014--9.html">Game: Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (PS3, 2014) (10)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2014/">2014</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2014/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2014/02/20/">20</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played today for about three hours and just exterminated

had a system like this in it before.

on the look out for more and just have a few more to do. Most of
the remaining ones are related to the ultimate monsters. I read a
message board about the dragon and was really scared off. I was a
bit annoyed though because I tried to fight it, but it didn't
appear in the area. I exterminated two hard enemies---the Reaver
and the Protoflorian---which was pretty cool. I find that fighting
in the Wildlands is the best because Chocobodin helps you. The
Reaver's sword is amazing and it inspired me to change up my
schemata set up a lot. I am using the Ninja outfit a lot and
optimized around long combos with it. It seems to be performing
well. After doing the sidequests, my main goal will be to farm
Soul Seeds before the time to go to the final stages of the game.

Curse + -ga spells spammed over and over. I started to try closing
