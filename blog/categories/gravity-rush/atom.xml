    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like two hours tonight. The "gameplay loop" of this
game is very repetitive. I feel like my use of the fighting system
is so boring, but so effective too that it doesn't matter. I still
like the feeling of flying through the air though. I feel like
that game is too long and I've already played it for so long. I
had a lot of frustrating times tonight when I needed to swing the
camera fast and couldn't.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn't do
any of the combat ones. I'm really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I'm moving it away from myself. It's
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the "stealth" mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the "recharging" missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying... I feel like I'm Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don't feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I'm pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren't precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I'll probably get used to it as I play. It's a fun little
game... definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn't have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>
