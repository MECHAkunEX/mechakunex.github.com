    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I'd actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn't touched
it since.</p>

<p>I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.</p>

<p>There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.</p>
