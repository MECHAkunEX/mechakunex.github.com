    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the Darkroot Forest and killed the
boss and got some awesome equipment. At first when I tried to get
Pharis' bow, he fell off the cliff and so I didn't get it. But
later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot
higher because of the ring.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today. I gained a level in the Painted
World and then worked my way back so I could explore the Darkroot
Garden. I killed the Butterfly and unlocked the magic door, but
then stopped for the night.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and got to the first boss of Anor
Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can't really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well... not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little less than an hour tonight. I gained a level
by killing the gargoyle and then all the sentinels again---I
wanted to get all the chests... I forgot one. Then it took me a
while to figure out how to get to the chapel. I fought my way to
the fog gate, but then ran out of time for the night, so I walked
back. I wanted to do an epic jump, but misjudged the distance and
plummeted to my death. Nice.</p>
