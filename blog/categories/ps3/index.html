<div class="entry-content">I played today for a little over an hour. I got through the next
part of the Undead Parish. The Rhino was pretty tough and got me
once. Then I weaved my way around and accidentally stumbled into
the Bell Gargoyle fight. I died the first three times and then
accidentally died on the way. So I lost about 6k souls. Ouch. This
game is definitely great.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today and got used to the game. I
spent a long time planning my character based on remembering what
was a good strategy in Demon's Souls. I'll be taking the same
approach: really fast, huge shield, melee focus, but with a good
bow.

The tutorial phase of the game was much shorter and so far the
game seems incredibly linear, which I thought wasn't the case, but
maybe I'm just still in the beginning. Last time I took a very
linear approach through the game, but this time I intend to
explore a bit more.

The mechanics of the game are basically identical. The graphics
seem a little bit better... primarily in the lightning department,
but I don't know if I can really tell or I just have a bad
memory. It seems like this simply *is* Demon's Souls with a little
bit of a different structure---no hub, Humanity, etc.

That makes it sound like I don't like the idea of that, but I'm
actually very excited about playing it.

During my time tonight, I died twice. Each time against a boss on
my first fight with them. The game seems just as hard as before,
but I'm getting used to the controls again and learning how the
bosses behave. Overall, it's a pretty awesome game.

Here are my current stats (where ! indicates that the stat is at
the level I intend to leave it at for the foreseeable future):

<div class="entry-content">I played another 30-ish minutes of the game. I decided that I'm
not interested enough in this game to play it. The story seems
fine, maybe a bit cliche. The interesting thing to me was the
setting of the intro movie, which was abandoned pretty instantly
and now I'm on random medieval planet (like the first three
games.) I'll ignore a boring story if the gameplay is awesome,
but...

I can't remember what the combat system was like for the third
game (I remember liking it, but I feel like it was similar to
this) but I'm not compelled by this one at all. It's a cross
between way too easy and way too frustrating. For example, most
battles can be won by simply pressing X over and over. There's a
"blindside" system, but it's basically impossible to use when you
are ganged up on, and when you aren't ganged up on, you can just
time your attacks to never need to dodge. It's frustrating that
you can't really use it well. The targeting system is really
frustrating because it never seems to go where you want and
there's no way to lock on to a target. The field is really bad,
because sometimes you'll run at an enemy from behind, but the hit
detection is off, so you end up getting them from the side and you
get a Surprise attack, even though you clearly snuck up on them
from behind. Argh! The controls in combat are really laggy with
hidden timers or something. This is the worst when it comes to
jumping. You'll hit the button and then have a noticeable delay
before the jump happens. 

The game aspires to feel like a third-person action game, but it's
not good enough at it to make the comparison a good thing. It
pales in comparison to Bayonetta. I don't think I have the time
and interest to play 50 hours (the median time on
HowLongToBeat.com) of something that is not totally amazing.

I'm glad I've played tri-Ace games released after this, because I
can imagine that if I played this on release, I would be skeptical
of their ability to continue to deliver hits. But, Resonance of
Fate was amaaaazing, so tri-Ace still has it.

So long, Star Ocean.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven't
really been captured by it. I'm not sure why. The combat system
doesn't seem as advanced as I'd like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I'll keep playing, but I'm a bit sad I
haven't been totally won over by it.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
"Inn" to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.

In a small way I've been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There's just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.

I think doing one "episode" per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.

<div class="entry-content">I've played the first and third Star Ocean games and really
enjoyed them. I generally like everything that tri-Ace does, so
I'm looking forward to this game. I like the idea of the enhanced
PS3 version, but I don't really know anything about the game or
about what is enhanced about this release.

--

I played for about an hour in my first session. The concept of the
world is pretty cool. It's the first Star Ocean I can think of
that has Earth as a real place. I wonder if it is supposed to be
in the same continuity as the other games? The gameplay seems like
it will be cool. The battle system tutorial was incredibly
complicated and I did during the battle three times before
winning. That makes me hopeful, although a little bit of the time
I felt like I was losing because I couldn't target the thing I
wanted. The graphics are pretty good, although the characters are
verrry anime-y and from some angles their clothes really clash
with their faces. (For example, the guy on the computer screen
that Edge talks to.) The controls are responsive.  Although the
camera controls are a little too "tight" for my taste so far. I
got a little stuck walking around in the space ship. I think the
problem is that the world is so "bright" that it's hard to notice
something you can bump into. Anyways, the majority of the time was
spent in videos, so I don't really have a good feel for the game
yet.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn't load my Clear data, so I'm
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.

It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war... especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!

The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the "stealth" missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you'd make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)

I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don't think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I've got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it's mainly the story pushing me to do more.

It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren't counted
in the real total. Wow!

I highly recommend this game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the "Undodgeable
Shot" ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn't
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D'oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.

I can't believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia---he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today. I did a bunch of different
missions, all were done in a relatively "stealthy" style. It was
very hard though, but quite fun. The story is really interesting,
as I said. I was quite surprised by who shot Alicia. After the
next battle, I unlocked a few reports, which I am now going
through.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about 33 minutes today and basically just learned
that Alicia really is a Valkyria and she's super tough. I lost the
battle pretty hard, because I did a stealth rush and couldn't
defend the forward base. Now that I know where the enemy will be,
I think I will try to pre-place Lancers behind the where the tanks
appear! We'll see tomorrow.

<div class="entry-content">I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.

The story is getting really neat and touching. I can't believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to "avenge" her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she'll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&D area, so I suspect that it really isn't
that close to being done.

This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It's very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.

buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able

not to. I wanted to because I'm curious about what Zaka will be
like... do I really get another vehicle? I'm running really low on
money too, so I think I need to play skirmishes a few times to get

<div class="entry-content">Another three hours. Today I did a few battles and I realized what
the "reports" I'd seen showing up were... how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service... I mean, the beach vacation... one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight. The story battles are
getting pretty rough and un-cheese-able, which is really fun
because it forces me to try different things. I got a really bad
score in the second woodland battle, which was kinda sad, so I did
another skirmish so I could get the XP I missed. I really enjoyed
using the tank a lot in the woodland battle though.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named "Ty the
Immortal"---I couldn't seem to land a killing hit on him... maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I'm sad I didn't get an A
on that fight.

I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
"fantastical" in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It's neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.

The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn't cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)---getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two---then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.

I'm using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.

I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can't do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.

I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.

- You can't reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can't decide that
you've made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.

- The game doesn't auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don't put enough Lancers, etc.

- The game doesn't give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don't see why
this is kept from me.

- The game doesn't do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.

So far I'm really like the story and the gameplay. It's a really
fun game!

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that'll be my
method... whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I'll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.

So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting... there's a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can't wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.

I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the "Imps", which I reckon means "Imperials." Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.

<div class="entry-content">[Joystiq](http://feeds.joystiq.com/~r/weblogsinc/joystiq/~3/J72px2lMtpU/) - He mentions some appalling music tracks: agree. He
doesn't like Chocobolina: I agree, but I also don't care. He
thought it was hard: I disagree. I don't think his review is very
deep.

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml) - I like the review.

[Kotaku](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/excerpts/~3/2gL3kyCtDGw/final-fantasy-xiii%2B2-the-kotaku-review) - Also like it

[Edge](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/) - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won't get
you that.

[Christian Nutt in Gamasutra](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php) - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn't need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?

[2D-X Diaries](http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/) - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/02/27/Game--Final-Fantasy-13-2--PS3--2012--23/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 2 (PS3, 2012) - Review/Summary</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-02-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Now that I've beat the game and 100%'d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect---there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor---a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.

FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem---the UI is much better in ways you wouldn't
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun & diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
"mechanics", much better, in fact.

There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the "drive" of the
characters---escape---consumes all story bandwidth.

But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn't even re-use every environment and there didn't seem to
be very much from the "whole game of content" that was cut
from 13.

However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don't think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn't feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.

This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn't pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content---the super hard bosses, like FF13's missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.

In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13's 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.

Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.

Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope---other than To Be Continued---that would've
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.

Overall, I'm glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I'm not sure I'd
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I'd hope for a bit more
improvements.

I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.

<div class="entry-content">Today I am looking for more monsters... on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I'll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy---I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I'm kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don't want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I'll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It's weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn't see any extra scene... will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits... that's it... so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there's no harder monsters to challenge, so it's like it isn't
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn't acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]

the Long Gui on the second try with 2 staggers and 5 stars. Beat
Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the "last time on
FF13-2", it shows Lightning saying "It's up to you to keep hope
alive". It was "It's up to you to keep Hope alive", then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn't on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content">Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There's a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool---especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the "real/good" ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. "The Future
is Hope" ending is strange because it seems like the "true"
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good---but it's very anti-climatic... although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: "A new adventure was just beginning---the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!" Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough... it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn't feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn't been any explanation given of why Snow is a l'Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower--The A.Z Files---reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
that can be done in the game still. [050:43:10 Frags 157/160 Lvl

other points in the story see can see everything

<div class="entry-content">I found another random fragment in New Bodhum 700 AF. I find it
very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem
totally hidden... like I can't really find them until something in
the game changes... like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don't like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh's appearance is pretty funny. Hope's
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn't get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can't make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) -- bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can't just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah's earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending... Lightning on
the goddess Etro's throne looked wicked cool though. "To Be
Continued"? FF13-3? Or just one of the other endings? I don't
understand what the Paradox Scope will do... should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each
gate that has free fragments. [036:33:45 Frags 102/160 Lvl 418]

far missions where you have to travel to the
past/future. Actually, I've got to jump around quite a
bit. Something I'm not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I've been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM... the hover doesn't seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting... Mog is so funny in his
opinions about humans. :) I'm running the slot machines on auto

fact that there is kind of a "hidden object" game inside this game

dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine---would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn't;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius' life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I've been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They've firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn't win him as a monster? I tried Lightning & Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight's stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I'll be put into the
end game. [030:49:01 Frags 83/160 Lvl 337]

<div class="entry-content">They do a really good job communicating Serah's changing feelings
about her task... from meeting Lightning to saving the future. It
is getting hard to keep track of what episode I am in. I think I
found the Casino (mini games!) and a place that will lead to
Lightning at the end of the game. Some of these assets are clearly
re-used, because they are places from FF13, but they look so
different, I don't see how this is any cheaper to make than a new
game. The Moogle Toss system is funny. It has just hit me that the
Preemptive Strike bonus is a lot weaker in this game: just about
half staggered and Haste. I got to Serendipity for the first
time... Chocobo races!!! The Proto fal'Cie in Academia are
crazy. The Academia part is really annoying because you are
overwhelmed with monsters, but they don't give any gil or CP. I
just noticed you can get 6 digits of HP. I intend to go to the
fragment reward place every day. I decided to keep track of my
levels differently, by adding them up because I won't go past 60
for a while. That also means that I won't need to keep two
numbers, since they will be the same. I made a mistake when I
expanded Serah's Crystarium. I maxed out my two main roles and
should have gotten another role, but instead expanded my
accessories. Oh well. It is so tempting to not read about some of
the mechanical details... like how many levels you can get
(presumably 99 in each?) what the fragment skills are,
etc. [014:06:26 Frags 21/160 Lvl 168]

<div class="entry-content">I've been using a lot of Phoenix Downs since I got to the Yassaf
Machif (?). Seems like a bad thing. It's pretty crazy to see Hope
as an older dude. I accidentally closed the Bresha gate and had to
redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It's pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won't do that good thing and you'll
drastically change what they did---probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]

<div class="entry-content">The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there's
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different... a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control... like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you'll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I'm glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can't tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03

<div class="entry-content">I decided to play through Final Fantasy 13 again in preparation
for Final Fantasy 13-2's release.

I started on 2011/11/26 and finished on 2012/01/09 and played it
basically every day. I intended to just critical path the story
and not do any side quests or grinding of any kind. I kept that up
until the final boss area. It took 23 hours (23:15) to get to Gran
Pulse, about 12 hours (34:40) to get through Pulse and then 3
hours (38:45) to get to the final area. At that point I decided
that I would get all the achievements, so I grinded for 30 hours
(64:30), then did side quests for about 9 hours (73:45), then
grinded a bit more (77:57), then beat the game (79:56), and then
finished the remaining side quests and trophies (88:54). It was
interesting that this was the same amount of time as the last time
I played through and didn't get everything.

Playing through the second time really solidified for me how
awesome this game is. It does an amazing job at making the combat
section action-packed and skill based. I remember being totally
destroyed by a few bosses the first time through the game; and
this time even though I was less powerful after I was beat once, I
could re-orient my strategy based on a better understanding of the
mechanics and conquer it.

I still think there are some improvements that could be made. I
noticed that the voice acting throughout Pulse is much worse than
the rest of the voice acting. I was bugged by how important
position was in combat, even though you can't really influence
it. I was also re-convinced that the game is way too stingy on
money and experience.

But nevertheless, it was amazing and it definitely enters the FF
canon for me. I look forward to the next one with great
anticipation.

  <h2>2011</h2>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/27/Game--Gran-Turismo-5--PS3--2010--2/">Game: Gran Turismo 5 (PS3, 2010) (3)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I bought Gran Turismo 5 for Christmas for my dad and I. I'd never
really been super into a racing game before, although I played a
racing game for the SNES and I got a diddly wheel for the PS1 to
play Ridge Racer with. I remember going over Sean's house and
seeing his brother play Gran Turismo 1, but it's always been in my
periphery since then. I'd been hearing a lot about how awesome the
game was and how demanding it was of your skill, so I decided to
make it a new hobby. Due to the flood, it took until some time in
January to start playing regularly. After getting started with the
controller I decided that I needed a racing wheel and a stand for
it. That was a really good idea, because it made the game so much
more awesome.

From January to September, I played the game every day. For the
first two-ish months I would play for about an hour or so, but
after that I would just do one race/event per night. After
September, I've been playing every two-ish days. After getting up
to the Extreme series in Spec A, I switched to closing out all the
Spec B races. In each case, I would not proceed until I got a gold
on every event (although I delayed a pre-Extreme event because it
was very very difficult.) After closing out the Spec B, I went
back and finished the other Extreme events. My statistics right
now are:

A-Spec Level: 28
B-Spec Level: 40
Game Progress: 95 %
Current Credits: 13,585,072
Total Wins: 303
No. of Cars Owned: 135
Trophies Earned: 50 %
Total Distance Driven: 42,292.1 Miles
Licenses: S (Gold: 25; Silver: 8; Bronze: 27)

Right now, I only have one Spec A event in Extreme left... the
Formula GT races (which are incredibly difficult) and all the Spec
A Endurance races. Plus I'd like to go back and get gold in every
License test and I haven't done many Special Events.

However, I'm at the point where every task left in the game
(i.e. the 5% of the game that remains) is excruciatingly difficult
and often very time consuming. For example, each Formula GT race
takes about 30 minutes and you need to do six of them to win the
event. You can save the game in between races, but you can't
tackle the courses piecemeal. The Endurance races were incredibly
tedious even on Spec B (which is AI controlled)... I can't imagine
how horrible they would be in Spec A.

Given how much time I've played the game... obviously it is
amazing. I wish there were more of the average difficulty races,
because I'm now at the depressing stage of playing the game more
and more. Basically, I wish I could play the game for ever and
keep making incremental progress, whereas right now I feel like I
need to jump a really big wall.

Overall, my favourite thing about the game was the nice difficulty
curve that made you always feel like you were improving and the
general skill that I feel like I've acquired because of it. It's
almost like a shmup in a sense, because you have to gain personal
skill to do well. There were some awesome moments at the beginning
of the game when I was shaving milliseconds of trial times to get
a gold trophy. It was very satisfying to do. Sometimes though it
feels like you just need to get a better car to even have a chance
at certain races and it is hard to tell when that is. I think the
UI could be improved to give you some indication that your car is
very weak relative to the competition. Eventually I started using
a guide to recommend which cars to get... because there are so
many it is hard to decide what to buy at any one time.

The graphics and sound are amazing, as expected. The
side-of-the-road textures are really bad when you are going slow
(because you are terrible) but at the right speed they are
great. I had a little bit of screen tearing, but I get the feeling
it was something with my TV rather than the game. My favourite
tracks were the forest tracks where you got to see the interplay
of shadows and light. Very beautiful.

When I was doing Spec B at the end, I found the RPG side of the
game... getting credits and cars and upgrades to be strangely
satisfying. I can't reiterate enough how absurd the Endurance
races are. There are 9, 12, 24 hour, etc races. It is
ridiculous. I would leave the game on over night or all day to
just finish them once I knew I had a strong enough driver, car,
and pit-strategy to just win with no effort. I wish there were a
"Simulate until the end of the race" button. The worst was
grinding the XP to get to the final race. I was a little annoyed
that nothing happened when I beat every single Spec B race.

I will continue playing the game. The main question is whether I
keep pushing at the remaining 5% or if I select the part of the
game that I like and keep doing it over and over. Probably a
balance of the two. However, I don't think it would be possible
for me to actually play the whole game from the start again. Maybe
if they had some way of locking you out of certain driving assists
to have a different "difficulty" level, I would consider it. But
Gran Turismo 6.... probably :)

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/26/Game--Battlefield-3--PS3--2011--0/">Game: Battlefield 3 (PS3, 2011)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I played through the Battlefield 3 campaign.

A friend of mine lent me the game because he had played through it
and enjoyed it.

A little background before I discussed the game. I played through
all the original id FPS games: Wolf, Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2,
and then Quake 3. I got really into deathmatch around Quake 2 time
and played very competitively. The only console FPS games I have
ever played were Modern Warfare 1 and this. I basically had a 10
year gap of playing FPS games and have never played one on the
computer since then.

The first thing I noticed about this game was that the language
was very poor in attempt to be realistic, although they seem to
almost exclusively use the F swear word. This is most prominent in
the very beginning of the game when you are with a group of
people.

The graphics are quite good, although nothing really
spectacular. In some places, there are really bad glitches. For
example when you a driving a tank quickly there are fields of
shrubs popping into existence in front of you as you drive. The
degree to which they go to duplicate film is almost
embarrassing. There are many fake film grains and "dust in the
air" effects. One character model looks exactly like the voice
actor (who is a relatively famous actor). Why not just be a movie
if you really want to be a movie? While playing the game, the most
impressive thing is the lighting.

Another thing I noticed quickly about the game is how slow it
is. You feel like you are crawling all the time or that there is a
run button that you can't find and thus are in stealth mode or
something. This sluggishness extends to the aiming controls as
well. I found that the sensitively just increased the size of the
"jumps" rather than their frequency. This is definitely a place
where old games were vastly superior. I assume the change is to
support the inferior console controls and/or inferior mass player
population.

I assumed that it would be fun to be part of a squad and run
around with other dudes. But most of the time you are just
following one guy (with a giant "Follow" marker on his head) and
then you get somewhere and they give you something important to
do. (Inexplicably you are the best at everything, yet need to
always be told exactly what to do.) An annoying necessity to give
the player something exciting to do.

The squad mechanics are related to my least favourite thing about
the game: you feel like you never accomplished anything. There
were many times where I was with my squad trying to advance or
defend some position and there seem to be an infinite number of
attackers (both at that instant and because more would come) but
then I kill one guy and suddenly all the opponents are suddenly
dead and it is time to move forward. I feel like the abstraction
inside the game is that X enemies must be killed before you can
advance or one from each of the 12 positions, which otherwise
refill shortly. It's very strange and gives you the impression
that you are randomly shooting until the roller coaster moves on.

The shooting itself is very infantile. The aim assist system is so
strong that it seems like you can just alternately tap the left
and right shoulder buttons to bring up the sights... auto
aim... shoot... do it again. It is easily the most effective way
to play and it has basically no skill, yet it is also visually
jarring and makes me a little dizzy.

Dodging is just as easy because you don't need to. It's like an
action movie where every enemy always misses and the hero never
misses. You feel like there are always bullets flying but they
never hit you unless you are totally out in the open (i.e. not in
the right place... behind the guy you are following.) If you ever
do get hit, just duck for a few seconds and go back.

Since you don't have to really plan where to go (follow the guy),
or what to shoot (everything), or try very hard to shoot (auto
aim), or dodge, you rarely feel like you have any impact on
the game or any real challenge. It's just like a ride.

Roller coaster ride is normally a good thing to describe something
as, but in this case it has one of the bad aspects of a roller
coaster. You have no idea where you are going and don't feel like
you have control over it. There is literally never any reason to
go backwards or on a different path.

The only times I ever died was before I learned to always follow
the guy, during cutscenes (more below), and when I didn't realize
it wasn't time to advance (related to not following the guy.) I
never felt like any death was due to lack of skill, but was due to
the game's weird rules. (For example, you kill all the guys you
can see in front of you, but you haven't killed enough on the
other side, so when you get beyond them you instantly die from
advancing to far or everyone inexplicably turns to you because now
they can see you.... and you're the player.)

The ride has little breaks where you pilot vehicles. These seemed
like a preview for the multiplayer, because they weren't very fun
or challenging, but they were just a little break. The best part
was actually the pre-flight checks on the jet mission. Not because
it was particularly fun, but because it felt really realistic and
cute. I was kind of surprised at how boring the flying was. The
tank drive was just frustrating because it controlled so poorly. I
guess that's realistic. =)

Easily the worst thing about the game were the quick-time events
and the pseudo-cutscene where you need to do something. The QTEs
are so dumb because you have a split second to make a button
press, but there's no reason why that should be the button you
have to press and it is up so far. Basically this means that you
have to die three or four times and memorize the button sequence
at do it. This would not be so horrific it didn't take so long to
get back to where you were before. At the last QTE, the whole
sequence maybe took 40 seconds, but every time you died, it would
take about 160 seconds to reload. It was excruciating. Another
occasion was like that because you weren't really in a normal
cutscene, but control was taken away from you, but then suddenly
you need to shoot... but the rules of shooting were broken because
you can't aim. The first time I did I died because I tried to aim
and then shoot rather than just shoot. Argh.

The way they deal with failure in the game is really weird. If you
get shot at and died, you fall down dead. That's great. If you do
something incorrectly, like you don't get to the vehicle fast
enough, the game screen just turns black and you do it again. They
don't depict the consequence in any way. It's very weird and
jarring.

The height of the game for me was the sniper mission, because it
felt very cool and had great graphics.

The story of the game was fine. It was like a Tom Clancy book, but
with this strange interrogation/flash-back/flash-forward motif. I
thought it was really neat that you played the end first and then
went back, and the second time you did it, it seemed to be
harder... i.e. not actually harder, but with more enemies. Some
story segments were very meh. For instance, the HALO jump that the
soliders do is so lame compared to Metal Gear Solid 3.

A few tiny annoyances: You can't pause cutscenes and when I tried
I accidentally skipped on. They give you hints to do things even
if you are already doing them... like crouching, so you think you
must not really be crouching, so you stand up, and then you
die. Thanks game.

The game didn't give me any play statistics, but I started at
7:15pm (that was the earliest achievement at least, so it must
have been a bit before that) and the last achievement was at
1:38am, but I took a break to have a big snack, talk to the wife,
get ready for bed, etc. I'd reckon the game took about 5 hours.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/10/16/Game--Resonance-of-Fate--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Resonance of Fate (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">my wife got me Resonance of Fate for the PS3 for my birthday, but I
didn't start playing it until the beginning of August.

# Play details

I played it pretty much every day in August, when it was my main
game, but by the end of August, I was getting a bit tired of it. I
did every thing that was possible to do in the game as I played:
all the extra missions, challenge fights, and going to the Arena
occasionally. Eventually, the grind wore down on me quite a bit. I
stopped doing the challenge fights in chapter 10 and then in
chapter 12 I decided to stop doing the extra missions. This was
after 38.5 hours of playing the game. At that point, I rushed to
the end, but when I got to chapter 14, I couldn't get past the
first room of the story mission dungeon. I realized I wouldn't be
able to do, so I went back to my chapter 12 save and just played
for a very short time (about 1 battle or 1 mission) every day. It
took me until yesterday to get to the last dungeon and I decided
to push on through to the end of the game.

In the end, I played for 54 hours. Vashyron was level 76
(30+28+18), Zephyr was level 86 (27+35+24), and Leanne was level 3
(32+27+24). I definitely will not do all the Arena ranks or play
through the secret Neverland dungeon.

# Story

I found the story of the game to be really intriguing. The world
is very different than most games and I like the way that there
isn't a lot of exposition in the game. Instead, you are just
normal-ish people in the world and things gradually unfold. Most
cut-scenes are less than two minutes long it seems. Some cut
scenes are hilarious and some are really fascinating and
cool. However, after you get to level 10 or so and you realize
that the game must almost be over, it is really weird that it
seems like nothing really happened. It's just mild character
development. Even when the game was over, I said to myself, "What
even happened in this game?" I read the Wikipedia page about the
game and then all the dots connected. The story in the game is
intriguing and vague; the story in the Wikipedia page is
fascinating... I just wish it were in the game.

# Style

The characters and world exude "style". I love the dress-up
mini-game and I bought lots of different clothes until I found an
outfit for each character I really liked. I dressed Leanne with
black glasses, a black tight sweater, a pink knee-length skirt,
and tall white boots with a big bow on the laces so they looked
like  knee-ish high socks. I dressed Vash in jeans and a cool
white Resonance of Fate jacket. I dressed Zephyr in a dark
green-ish suit with a red undershirt.

The style really comes to a head in the battle system. It feels
exactly like a John Woo movie.

The Christmas segment... including the costumes... is insane.

I can't believe tri-Ace... which I think of as a very small
company... could make such a beautiful game.

# Mechanics

The most important part of a game to me is its mechanics. In RoF,
there are a few systems.

First, there's the world map. It is basically a board game where
you are unlocking pieces of the world with Tetris-like jigsaw
pieces you get from battles. You can only go places you unlock and
by unlocking places you gain other rewards such as items or
effects in battle. It is neat and totally unnecessary (for the
rest of the game to work), but I enjoy it, so it is a welcome
addition.

Second, there's the gun customization and item synthesize
systems. The game's combat is gun-based and you can customize your
guns with additional parts like barrels, scopes, magazines,
etc. There are like 5 attributes that you can enhance. I have no
idea what these attributes actually do, despite having played
through the whole game and spent a lot of time customizing. The
system works by laying out the extra parts in a 2D grid where they
must connect in appropriate ways (empty circle attaches to full
circle, empty square to full square, etc) to each other and
ultimately to the gun. It is fun to make ridiculous looking guns,
but I don't feel I really understood it enough to do it well. The
item synthesis is a corollary to this system because you can build
parts (and accessories, grenades, and bullets) with it. I don't
think I mastered (or needed to master) either system, but I did
use and have fun with them.

Third, there's the progression system. Each character has three
levels that are summed to get their total level. There's one level
per type of weapon---hand gun, machine gun, and thrown
weapon. Gaining levels gives you abilities when using that weapon,
like 10% damage increase, etc. I didn't focus each
character. Instead, I constantly rotated weapons around (you gain
levels in the weapons you use) to the weak character with that
weapon to boost their total level. Gaining total levels gives you
health and weight capacity (did I mention guns, accessories, and
their parts have weights?) I wonder if it would have been better
to focus each character.

Fourth, and biggest, there's the combat system. It is incredibly
complicated to explain, but very simple once you understand
it. The fundamental principle is that you can do a lot of blue
damage and very little red damage and only red damage kills
guys. However, if someone has 100 points of blue damage and you do
1 point of red damage, then the blue converts to red and you just
did 101 points of red damage. Everything in combat is about
filling up blue damage and then doing a little red
damage. However, there are many subtleties.

The most basic is that the angle you are firing at the enemy
matters and many enemies have shields that absorb fire from one
direction. The next is that blue damage recovers over time, so you
want to focus. The next is that you charge shots faster the closer
you are to the enemy. The next is that blue damage on you does not
turn into red damage, but instead when it fills up your whole life
gauge takes away 1 Hero point for every 1000 hit points. But
what's a hero point?

In this game, you can either stand still, charge and fire once, or
you can run past an enemy (jumping through the air and sliding on
the ground) and fire many times. When you make a run, you use a
Hero Point. You need to do this to make enough attacks. If you
ever run out of Hero Points, the next time your HP fills up blue,
you'll die, but you'll die anyways because you can't do these
runs. There's another subtlety though. If you run across the line
made by the other two characters, it gives you a Resonance Point,
which you can convert to one cycle of a tri-Attack where each
character makes a Hero Run to the point where the next character
is standing. During a tri-Attack, any enemy inside the triangle
cannot move or have their blue damage healed.

The trick to this system is that there is only one strategy: Have
each character make a hero run across the line of the other
characters such that they go really close to the enemy and end up
on the other side. Do this twice to set up a tri-Attack with a big
triangle. Then do it again. This technique wins every single
battle. The only thing you ever need to do in addition is
sometimes use grenades to cause area damage or wear the right
status-effect protection accessory.

In the beginning of the game (probably the first 20 hours), this
system feels really cool and neat every time. It is definitely fun
and original. However, after a while, you realize that it is just
like Sudoku. Every Sudoku board is the same because your strategy
is always the same. What you are doing is always the same. In
contrast, even though you can describe FF13 or Bayonetta in a
reductionist way---increase stress and then do damage OR do combos
and then do torture attacks----how you do that is different in
every situation. In RoF, it's the same. It doesn't exactly get
boring, but it loses its challenge.

The worst part, however, about the combat system is that it feels
a little too random sometimes. As mentioned before, there's just
one strategy I used. But I still often needed to make the attempt
to beat a boss three or four times in sequence before winning. The
only thing that separated one attempt from another were random
factors like causing a break, getting pushed a little bit by fire,
or getting a full scratch, or something. It doesn't seem right
that a random flip will make me go from utter defeat to utter
dominance. It seems like a random factor should make a small
difference, not a big one. This suggests to me that the game
really doesn't require much skill if I could never recover from
little flips like that.

A related problem is that it never feels like there is anything
you can do to make your characters better or more
powerful. Gaining levels, getting gun upgrades, etc don't seem to
make any difference on your play. I'm sure they do something but
it is so gradual they you never feel like you've reached a
new plateau where you can look down at where you were
and say you rock. There's nothing technically wrong with this, but
it doesn't give me the feeling I want.

# Summary

I was looking forward to this game because I've enjoyed every game
that tri-Ace has released that I've played. (I think I have missed
two games.) And when it was first coming out, I heard lots of fun
conversations about its crazy battle system. I wasn't let down by
the game, but I don't think this game will be as lasting to me as
Valkyrie Profile or Star Ocean 3 are. Overall, I recommend the
game. If you aren't super hardcore like me, maybe it would better
to have an easy mode, but I don't think one exists.

<time datetime="2011-09-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I've been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I've been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.

I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.

Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don't like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it's pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn't have anywhere near the depth I'd like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.

The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It's simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there's no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn't play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn't totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.

Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don't
need it.

The most appropriate word for this game is "fantastic" in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.

The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you've
seen or thought of before and doesn't really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels' tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you're walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It's
really quite amazing.

What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It's very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.

The story is baffling. I can't tell if that's because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it's baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There's something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.

When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don't think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don't feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it's nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.

Overall, I'd say this is a must player.

Best Reader: YOU

I like [JC Fletcher's review](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/): "It's not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet." and "If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing ... your dream has been
fulfilled."

<div class="entry-content">I played inFAMOUS last night. I'm glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the "So, sorry, Sony" program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.

At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.

The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.

I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.

Ba-leted!

This could have been a really charming and enjoyable game,

Wow, bad controls. So bad, I'm not actually interested in playing

Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.

It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons---although there are some clear winners overall.

My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can't. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.

I'd recommend it, but I probably won't schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/07/08/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid-4--PS3--2008--1/">Game: Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3, 2008) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-07-08T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)

First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard---the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no "Game Over if Spotted" mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.

After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:

Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP

You'll notice that I didn't make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I'm proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that's attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.

Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP

I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.

Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP

I think I bought a shotgun or something.

Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 64 (30 more)
Current Drebin Points: 153,021DP

At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.

Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 46 (15 more)
Alert Phases: 89 (8 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 81 (17 more)
Weapon Types Procured: 37
Flashbacks Watched: 214
Special Items Used: Not Used
Current Drebin Points: 332,947DP
Code Name: "Pigeon"
Other titles: Inchworm, Hyena, Pig, Leopard

I used more continues in the final stage than any other.

One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.

In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn't grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn't hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn't get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)

In the story department, this game is a winner.

All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.

The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.

The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.

There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.

I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.

The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.

my wife's comment: People's butts in this game look weird.

In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone's toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.

The credits music is beautiful.

It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.

<div class="entry-content">I just finished Shatter.

This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a "bullet hall" influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It's really a blast to
play.

The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.

I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.

The only thing I didn't like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball's movement on them.

I'd never really played a "Euroshmup" before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I'm not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)

The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/03/06/Game--Demon-s-Souls--PS3--2009--0/">Game: Demon's Souls (PS3, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-03-06T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>06</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Last night I finished Demon's Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.

I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.

This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you've "spent" the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn't necessary.

A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how "unforgiving", or how there is no "hand-holding". I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I'm not sure what hand-holding I would've wanted---there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you'll never be caught off guard. So many "action RPGs"
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon's Souls just requires caution and care.

So, Demon's Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it's a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.

As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of "spoilers". In those games, you can't "spoil" the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon's Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it's not really significant. I liked that
about it.

My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 1-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I'd have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.

After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote---I didn't really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I'd have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.

I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn't realize he'd be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would've just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.

The only "bug" I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.

Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight

Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7

Soul Level: 91

Throughout the game I used this equipment:

Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow    

This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)

Overall, the game was very good. I don't think I'm interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it's just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/09/Game--3D-Dot-Game-Heroes--PS3--2010--0/">Game: 3D Dot Game Heroes (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing 3D Dot Game Heroes.

I played for three nights. The first night I just started the
game and fooled around. The next night I got up to the Aqua temple
(7/15ths through the game). The next night (tonight) I got to the
end of the Aqua temple and the game crashed as I was leaving the
temple and I lost all my progress for the night. I do not tolerate
bugs like this, so I'm not interested in continuing the game.

There were some things I liked about this game: the quirky
graphics are very fun, especially the way that modern particle,
liquid, and reflection effects are used to accentuate the visuals;
the gigantic sword is cool; the core Zelda 1 gameplay is fun.

However, there are a few things I did not like: the movement is
not grid-based, so it is very easy to get slightly ajar from
enemies (who do move in a grid) and miss them when not powered up
despite standing in front of them; similarly, it is pretty easy to
get stuck on a corner for the same reason; the world is large (it
is the size of Zelda 3) but it feels really empty (there is a
Zelda 1 amount of stuff); and, obviously, the game breaking
bug.

Now that I've decided to drop it, I looked at the GameFAQs
page. It talks a lot about side quests and extra swords, etc, that
you can get. That sounds like it would be fun and add
replayability, but these things seem really buried in the
nose-to-the-grind-stone gameplay. I didn't notice many hooks
during my play-through of half the game. I'm sure if the game
wasn't broken, though, I'd want to stick around and do some of
them.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/07/Game--Vanquish--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Vanquish (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.

After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I'd never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.

I don't think I've ever really played a third-person
shooter. I've played third-person platform games with a little
shooting---like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I've
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I've certainly never played
anything in the modern "cover-based" shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.

I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very "real" and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.

I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a "squad" most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn't really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.

The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans---just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though---however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn't bothered
at all.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I'm an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.

There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there's a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards---as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.

The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the "cheap"
one-hit kills. For example, if you don't destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don't see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
"Unknown" enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack---over and
over. Yikes.

I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint---I
effectively "1cc'd" the game. Here are my stats:

Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77

I wish I could've kept track of the total time I played. (The
"Mission Time" is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.

While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don't feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played... nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.

Hoorah!

<div class="entry-content">I played Final Fantasy 13 for another 26 hours (making 88
total.) I got all the trophies except the incredibly tedious ones
(getting all other trophies, getting all items, getting 5 stars on
every mission, and beating a Long Gui.) This made me almost hate
this game.

The post-game is much more tedious than previous games. Completing
all the missions was very fun, but the grinding for money was
horrible. I did enough to get 4 Ultimate Weapons and max out 2 of
them. I see no justification for how stingy the game is.

I would've much /much/ rather played the main game in a New Game
Plus mode with higher money drop rates so I could re-view the
story and work through getting all the items.

<div class="entry-content">In this post, I will "respond" to articles on the Internet about
FF13. I've been delaying reading any until after I beat, so I
think now is the appropriate time. I will do my best to not be a
rabid fan boy about it. My goal is to capture my reactions to new
ideas I read elsewhere, rather than to argue anyone who disagrees
with my preferences.

[Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630). This review is hilarious, as all his are. (He curses a
lot by the way.) Here's a great quote: "The idea of the game is
that the characters all look like people who someone would want to
cosplay; they all act like characters who would be someone’s
favorite character." His discussion of the battle system is spot
on. I suppose the big difference is that I love it and he
doesn't. Same with launching enemies into the air. Here's
something that is quite true:

<blockquote><p>The battles will sometimes envelop you in<br/>sometimes ten entire minutes of grueling uphill climbing, forcing<br/>you to know that you’re doing something wrong. You pray for a<br/>zero-star ranking, for there to be some obvious “right way” to do<br/>this. Then the game gives you a five-star ranking, and your heart<br/>sinks: oh god, you are doing it the right way.</p></blockquote>

Just read his comment about the monsters not looking like
anything. That's true and its always been that way. I'm totally in
his "that's the way things are" camp.

[Jim Sterling](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-167136.phtml). "If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy XIII fan, prone
to emotional outburts and so defensive of Square Enix's latest
effort that you'll get upset by harsh criticism, then you're
advised to not read this review. If you don't want to see somebody
tear this game limb from limb, or are upset by videogame review in
general, then you should definitely not read it." I can see why
someone would be upset at his review, but I'm not in the
least. [I'm amazed at how people react to him](http://www.destructoid.com/the-joys-of-being-a-videogame-reviewer-167383.phtml).

I read a bunch of other reviews but didn't really feel like
commenting on any of them.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/03/28/Game--Final-Fantasy-13--PS3--2010--1/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 (PS3, 2010) (2)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content"># I love this game.

I bought /Final Fantasy 13/ on release day---the first
time I've bought a game on release day in years---and I've been
playing it constantly ever since. Yesterday I beat the story, so I
think it is an appropriate time to talk about the game. I imagine
that I will have more thoughts after the end-game, but I'll leave
those for a second post.

First, a note of warning, in this post I will talk about things
that I consider spoilers. However, keep in mind that I have cut
myself off from all video game related discussions during the past
20 days as I've been playing the game, so my spoiler threshold is
fairly low.

I'll start off with a little bit of numbers to give context to
somethings I talk about later. The game has 13 chapters. I spent
about 20 hours playing chapters 1 through 10. I spent about 20
hours in chapter 11. I spent about 12 hours playing chapter 12
and 13. The game is totally linear during until
chapter 11. Chapters 12 and 13 are also totally linear, but there
is an "escape" valve to go back to the non-linear chapter 11
area. I viewed this escape route as a way to grind if you couldn't
handle the challenges in the final areas, so I didn't use it. Now
that I've beat the game, I also see that the escape route is a way
to go back and do all the side excursions you didn't do when you
beat the game. (There are 64 side missions. When I beat the game,
I had beat about 30 of them.)

# Story

I really enjoyed the story of the game. I'd rate it about on
par with Final Fantasy VI, which as you may remember is my
previous favourite. The game does a very good job giving you
tidbits and making you feel like a part of the world from the
beginning. It gives the many twists in sensible places and it
isn't too absurd. I think it is a bit similar to how in the
beginning of FF6, Kefka is clearly a bad guy, but it's not obvious
he's /the/ bad guy.

The structure of the game really works to make the story more
compelling. The linearity in the beginning forces you to get
engrossed in the characters and world, rather than in the
mechanics. The space in the middle where there is a lot of freedom
works well with the story because the characters are mostly lost
and not sure what to do, which you reflect in your wandering
exploration. When you finally find out how to get back on to the
main line story, the train starts rolling and brings you to the
destination. Rather than a hundred hours of chocobo races while a
meteor is falling to destroy the planet, you have a focused strike
to the heart of the enemy. Not once did the linearity bother
me.

The game does this thing where rather than a big cut scene,
there will be a medium one, then you walk for a little, fight a
few battles, then you get a short cut scene, then you repeat. This
is great because you never get bored or feel like you're watching
a movie. However, there was a single time that it bothered
me. Without going into spoiling detail, there is one group working
together and then they split up into a few different groups, with
a totally new character accompany one person. The new character
has never met this person before and because the cut scene before
this was already long there is no conversation between them
introducing each other. You just start controlling this new
pair. After a few fights, however, they have the aforedesired
conversation. That was the one time I really wish I could turn
around, press a button, and have them talk to each other like in a
Western RPG.

# Music

The music is beautiful. I got the soundtrack and listen to it a
lot. I really like the way the "Theme" is incorporated into so
many songs. My favourite is the music at the "Sunleth
Waterscape".

# *REDACTED*acters

When I started playing I assumed that the game would be "about"
Lightning, in the same way FF7 is about Cloud or FF6 is about
Terra. Even though I felt that way the entire game, I realize in
retrospect that was really my choice as a player to keep her in my
battle time all the time and think about the events of the story
from her perspective. In actuality, every character really has
equal screen time and importance in the story. If anyone were
short changed, I think it would Sazh who is a non-entity during
the second half of the game and Fang/Vanille who don't really open
up until a third through.

my wife asked me which character I felt like I identified with
most. I'm not sure there was one that was the most, but there was
something in each I can connect with. Lightning is driven by duty,
responsibility, and determination. Snow is driven by love and
bravery. Sazh is driven by his family. Fang is driven by the need
to protect and serve her family. Hope is at first driven by
revenge and then he becomes the symbol of hope and
rebirth. Vanille is the bright spot in the dreary world, trying to
cheer everyone up.

My favourite characters are the girls: Lightning, Vanille, and
Fang.

# Gameplay

Roleplaying games are cleanly separated into the story and the
gameplay. In many games there are multiple levels of gameplay.

For example, in many games there is the battle system, the
resource management system, the progression system, and the
exploration system. The battle system is the core and everything
else revolves around it. If you play the resource management game
poorly, then you can't recover from battles or afford the needed
equipment to deal with larger threats. If you play the progression
game poorly, then you are not able to deal with the many
situations you'll be put into, because you've focused poorly. If
you play the exploration system poorly, then you won't find the
resources you need or you'll die by a thousand paper cuts by
exploring too deeply without the needed resources. If you play the
battle system too cavalierly, by using too many powerful spells
you'll hurt your resource management game even though you'll beat
any battle. Conversely, if you don't use your resources
effectively, you won't be effective in the battle system.

The subtler aspects of the gameplay (resource management and
progression) are often missed by casual observers you see games as
flipping through menus. The exploration gameplay (which is often
implemented through random battles---they punish exploration) is
often frustrating when you can't see it as a game of risk vs
reward. And the actual battle is often seen as flipping through
different menus, but a little bit faster.

A big problem with many games is that these systems don't
interact in a way that is optimally fun or in a way that balances
fun across time. For example, you are going to spent most of your
gameplay time in battles. However, in most games the average
battle can't be too hard because that would make the resource
management too hard. In almost all RPGs, you'll find yourself in
some area and the challenge is to get the end of that area with as
much magic points as possible, so you that you can be fully healed
and charged for an actually hard battle with a boss. Each battle
along the way is trying to get you to spend too much magic (or
items, etc) to get through it, so that you will have depleted that
resource by the time you get to the boss. For that reason, almost
no random battle is actually ever hard in a RPG. If you want to
win, you can pull out everything and get through it. But, if you
did that, you'd ruin your chances of beating the boss. This is why
when you play most games you spend 90% of the time pressing
"Attack" rather than using magic. This is boring because you
aren't making decisions. It's not exciting because you're not
getting to see the cool visuals of the spells, summons, etc. It's
not exciting because you're never really in danger.

Final Fantasy 13 does not have this problem.

The biggest departure from the genre FF13 makes, in my opinion,
is not having a tightly linear story. It is removing the resource
management game.

In FF13, you are fully healed after every single battle and
there is no MP inside or outside of battle. If you take battles
one at a time, you can throw everything you have at them and know
that you'll be able to through the same stuff out next time. This
gives the designers the freedom to make every battle hard. It
gives the player the freedom to make the battles exciting by using
everything at their disposal. This is also why when you die you
can start immediately in front of the enemy that killed you. Your
death couldn't possibly have anything to do with things you did
before. That makes deaths more of a teaching experience.

Of course, this is not totally true. There are resources in the
game. The battle resources are Technical Points, healing items,
and shrouds. The upgrading system (part of the progression system)
uses resources called components. However, the battle resources
are almost entirely unimportant. Technical Points allow you to use
your summons and special powers. You only have 5 and you get about
1 after every battle (if you do well.) It is not hard to manage
them and I basically treated them like MP in other games: reserved
for really hard fights. The healing items are basically worthless
once you can have a Medic in your party all the time and once you
learn the Raise spell. In fact, I never used them after that. They
seem to be there so that you can heal in the beginning of the
game. Thus, managing them is never really an issue. Shrouds give
you little buffs before a battle and I never used them, not
once. They did seem pretty scarce, but it never affected me.

Since there is basically no resource management relative to the
battle system, the battle system is fundamentally different than
all games before it. Every single battle requires strategic
thinking to defeat, not just the bosses. There were many times
when I would die from fighting a normal enemy, think about what I
did wrong, try something different, die again, then try a third
thing, and get through. That is soooo satisfying. It is satisfying
on a "shmup"-like level. As mentioned before, in a normal RPG
dying almost certainly means you are idiot. If you die in a random
battle, you were too stupid to pull out all the stops. If you die
in a boss battle, you were too flagrant with your use of abilities
in the earlier battles or you didn't figure out what the
vulnerabilities of the boss were. In FF13, a death is a great
learning experience that makes you appreciate the game more.

One of the best things about the battle system, which is a
little orthogonal to lack of resource management, is that you
actually need to employ all the features of the battle system to
be successful. (It is, of course, related to the lack of resources
because you are now free to utilize everything as well.) For
example, many games have status effects which you can give to
enemies (debuffs), however they almost never work on bosses, and
since they cost MP, you never use them. Similarly, many games have
status effects which you can give yourself (buffs), however their
effects are generally so small that it is only worthwhile to use
on bosses, but even then you've taken MP away from your damage or
healing potential, so you probably won't use them. In FF13, you
need to use your buffs and debuffs a lot. Similarly, many games
have tried to use defending classes to draw enemy blows,
etc. (Cyan from FF6 and Auron from FF10 are examples of this.)
There's almost no use for this though because bosses don't fall
for it and normal battles can be won by all-out attacks. Again,
FF13 really requires the Sentinel class. I could go, but I think
you get the point.

In a bit more visceral of a way, the battle system is
exciting. Even though you wait for the ATB gauge to charge before
unleashing attacks, I felt compelled to slam out commands as fast
as possible. I had to dart my eyes around and take in my party's
health, the enemy's stagger bar, the enemy attacks that were
charging, etc. It's really fun.

The fundamental strategy of the battle system is very versatile
too. Basically in every battle you are trying to get an enemy's
stagger bar to 100% then unleash powerful attacks on to destroy
it. Most attacks are relatively ineffective if an enemy isn't
staggered, so you have to do it. But, to stagger you need to focus
more on attacking than on defending or healing. Thus, you open
yourself up to attacks, so you have to drop back in a defensive
posture. But, if you wait too long, then your stagger progress
will be lost, so you have to switch back. Thus, the central
strategy compels you into a style of play where you are constantly
on the edge of winning or losing. This makes the game really
fun.

This change to the structure of the gameplay wasn't perfectly
integrated though. In particular, the exploration game is mostly
gone. Since each battle is a fresh start for your characters,
there is no punishment for exploring too far or taking the time to
look down a hallway for another treasure sphere. As a result, the
placement of treasure is almost totally predictable and when
you're wrong there's no big deal. It's clear they tried to
recreate this by having almost every treasure "guarded" by a
particular enemy. Yet, it doesn't work the same. However, the
exploration game was always much smaller in RPGs than roguelikes,
so it's not a big deal.

The final system, the progression system, of FF13 is great
too. There's two parts to it. The character progression
(Crystarium) and the equipment progression (upgrading). The
Crystarium is a mostly linear path through the skills and
abilities of your roles. It does a few things really well
however. First, all characters get Crystarium points, whether they
are in battle or not. This is a major frustration in other games
where you are suddenly forced to use different characters and you
have to grind to get them to the level they need to be for the
part of the game you're at. Second, it is really incremental. You
can get a new perk after only one or two battles. Third, even
though the path is mostly linear, you have to make a few important
decisions. Do you go for the new abilities that lie slightly off
the path and cost more? Or, do you go for the role bonus,
accessory, or ATB charge? Do you cherry pick from the various
roles trying to max one particular ability? (For example,
Vanille's strength isn't really a factor for the roles I put her
in, so it makes more sense to get her magic from other roles.) Do
you branch out of your primary roles? Etc. There are enough
decisions to make it fun, not enough to make it overwhelming, and
you can't really lock yourself into a stupid configuration like
you can in other games.

The equipment upgrading game is /the/ place where resource
management matters. Equipment requires components to
upgrade. Organic components make synthetic components more
effective. Synthetic components do the major upgrading. Both can
be dropped from monsters or bought with gil that is dropped or
received for selling other drops, but the game is very stingy
about drops and gil in general, so you feel perpetually in need of
more stuff. There's not much more to say about it other than it's
not so easy it's boring and it's not so hard it's
frustrating. (However, I haven't fully upgraded anything and I'm
not looking forward to raising the 2.2 million gil to buy the
component I need to do it.)

# User Interface

I didn't have any major problems with the game in any aspect of
it. However, I definitely had nitpicks that are almost totally
about the user interface.

*Battles.* I would've like more button binding when switching
paradigms. As it is, you have six or so in a list. You press L1 to
select one. I'd like to be able to press L1, then press a face
button to jump to a particular determined paradigm. That way I
could have Triangle be my preferred defending paradigm, Square be
my staggering, and X be my staggered, etc. I would have also liked
the ability to setup ability chains to enter simultaneously,
rather than slowly selecting them one by one.

*Crystarium.* I would've like to see to how many Crystarium points
each character had at the end of each battle. I spent too much
time opening up the menu to check if there was anything I could
get. Even better would've been the ability to pick a target power
and have all my points automatically go towards that power after
each battle.

*Paradigms.* Every time you change your battle party all your
paradigms setups are lost. Arggh! They should at least be remember
per party. Even better would be the ability to name and save sets
of configurations for different situations. I would've like the
ability to press L1 from the map and change my default paradigm
before a battle, rather than having to go through the main menu.

*Equipment.* I would've like the ability to name sets of
equipment. I would've like to be able to use the "Optimize" option
on a single slot or perhaps fix a particular slot. (Specifically,
I like to use Optimize, but don't want it to remove my Item
Collector equipment.)

*Exploration.* Gran Pulse really needs a single map. I had a hard
time remember which teleporting location was which by just their
names. Similarly, I should be able to look at a different area's
map rather than having to be in the area.

*Missions.* As it is, a C'ieth stone that you can take a mission
from is blue-y, if you've never completed the mission is pulses. I
think they should've been a different color for missions you
haven't got yet. That would've been much more convenient. I don't
understand what value the gameplay gets from not being able to
have multiple active missions at a time. There were times when I
was on a mission, passed another mission pickup spot, passed that
same mission's end point, then got to the mark of the mission I
was on, completed it, then had to backtrack twice: once to get the
new mission then once to get to its mark. That's really
annoying. I don't think it would make the game much easier to do
it differently.

# Replay

If this game had a New Game+, I would play it again instantly to
get the story again.

I plan on continuing to play to finish all the missions,
although I don't consider this "Replaying" the game. I'm playing
that content for the first time and I'm continuing my enjoyment of
the gameplay systems.

I can imagine playing through the main game again relatively
soon (say a year or eighteen months), but I can't imagine going
through all the missions, etc in the same time period. I imagine I
will treat this game like FF6 or FF7. I've beaten all the Weapons
and gotten everything in FF7 once, but I've played and beat the
game four or five times. I've played through FF6 five or six
times, and gotten everything twice.

<time datetime="2010-02-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Over the past few weeks I've been hearing more and more about
[Final Fantasy XIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII), the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. [GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/) previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about [what he loved](http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml) and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn't
love]]. And this morning I listened to [Active Time Babble](http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689) talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.

I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.

A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- *Challenging Battles:* Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I've also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- *Controlled Progression:* ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn't unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can't accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I'll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- *Controlled Cast:* ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don't have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact <em>in
character</em> in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don't think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don't use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don't actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I'm excited about
that.
- *Linear Progression:* ATB mentioned that you can't unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- *Post-game:* The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you've already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.

For giggles, I'll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can't think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.

(I've never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don't think 11 really
counts anyways. I'd like to do 8 and 9 again.)
