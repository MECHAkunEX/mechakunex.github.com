    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I noticed today that I could download this for my Vita, since I
already bought it for the PS3 back in 2008, so I downloaded it
and showed it to my wife. I love the opening... fighting with
Richter and then the abilitease. It's great.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love this movie. It's so inspirational and moving. I particularly
like the deep connection between it and the Gospel. I think it hits
the nail on the head in so many ways and is incredibly
pro-religion, of a sorts. I've read the book and I like both of
them for different reasons. It's hard to say a lot about a movie I
just gush over.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few nights, I've played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren't done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I'm stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren't displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I'm not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I've seen, it isn't Treasure's best work, but I'm glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've recently played through Tomba! over the past few weeks as my
"main" game.</p>

<p>This game defies categorization.</p>

<p>It's primarily a platforming game with a few accoutrements to
that basic experience: you get a number of different weapons, some
speed bonuses in form of new pants, and some utility items like a
grappling hook and a parasol (so you fall slower.) While the world
and gameplay in primarily 2D, you often need to jump into the
"background" and onto a different plane. Sometimes when you go
into the background the camera rotates to a different slice of a
3D area you're exploring. It's very neat mechanically.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the game is the mission system. As you
interact with the world and individuals in it, they inform you of
a problem. If and when you solve it, you gain AP and unlock
potentially more missions. Some of them are required, but
definitely not all of them. There are 130 in the game; I found 106
and cleared 87 of them. (I ended with 755,900 AP. I reckon this
isn't very much.)</p>

<p>Overall the game is very fun and unique. I imagine that Zelda II:
The Adventure of Link could have been like this game and moved the
Zelda series in a good direction rather the dead-end /Zelda II/
was. /Tomba!/ took me 4 hours and 27 minutes on the clock to beat,
but I would guess I probably spent closer to 2.5 times that amount
of time due to the difficulty of the platforming and bosses that
required reloading my save file.</p>

<p>I easily recommend it. Despite having typical PS1 loading time
problems, it's definitely worth it. I'm excited to play the sequel
eventually.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through most of Super God Trooper Zeroigar, a shmup for
the PC-FX, tonight. It was pretty rad, but got a little bland
towards the end, which is why I stopped playing. I don't
understand Japanese, so the long Anime cutscenes and conversations
didn't have a big impact on me, but I appreciated their
presence. The shmuping was good, but the controls are way too
sensitive, which led to many stupid deaths.</p>
