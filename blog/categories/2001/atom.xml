    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stupidity continues: (pg 188) [The context is that the pioneers
don't often win in technology.] "Palm Computing did not pioneer the
personal digital assistant; Apple did" (and clearly Palm has won in
that industry.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how "smart" the "great"
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can't
really go into that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they've been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) "We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've
uncovered."</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren't "conscientious" enough and even then
they say "almost any" and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don't make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the "companies" we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a "Great"
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a "humble" leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he'd play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn't have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn't beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you've conquered.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just played through Rez on the Dreamcast.</p>

<p>This is a very acclaimed game that I've heard a lot about. It's
well-known for its synergy between music, sound effects, visuals,
and actions. It is a Panzer Dragoon-style rail shooter with a
trance soundtrack and trippy theme. You start exploring a computer
system, but as you progress it implies that this computer system
has somehow consumed the real world and you are freeing it and
thus recreating Earth.</p>

<p>The game has really great style and fun gameplay. I had to play
each level (of 5) twice before beating them and I played the 1st
level a third time so I could get 100% to unlock level 5. I did
this over two days. I read online that there are unlockables for
getting more perfect scores, but the gameplay didn't compel me to
finish that part of the game.</p>

<p>This game solidifies more for me that I dislike the Dragoon-style
games, probably because I first played Sin &amp; Punishment and
like the ability to dodge too much. I find the gameplay
surprisingly shallow: the key is to chain and destroy things in
basically the order they appear on the screen.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm glad I played the game because I have more context
for thinking about games and a better understanding of the history
of this genre and a knowledge of this influential game, but I
won't be trying to complete it 100%.</p>

<p>BTW, I think this is named the wrong thing on DS cartridge, so may
need to fix the save to play again.</p>
