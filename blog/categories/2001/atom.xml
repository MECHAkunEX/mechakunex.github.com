    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stupidity continues: (pg 188) [The context is that the pioneers
don't often win in technology.] "Palm Computing did not pioneer the
personal digital assistant; Apple did" (and clearly Palm has won in
that industry.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how "smart" the "great"
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can't
really go into that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they've been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) "We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've
uncovered."</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren't "conscientious" enough and even then
they say "almost any" and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don't make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the "companies" we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a "Great"
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a "humble" leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he'd play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn't have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn't beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you've conquered.</p>

<p>BTW, I think this is named the wrong thing on DS cartridge, so may
need to fix the save to play again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dil Chahta Hai is very different than most of the Bollywood movies
I've seen so far. It is less silly, although still has many funny
moments. There is actually some intense dramatic action and sad
parts. Although not unique, one thing I liked was having no clue
how or if the couples would get together.</p>

<p>Preity Zinta was beautiful. Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna were very
good-looking.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>
