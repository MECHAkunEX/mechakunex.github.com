    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my last trip, I played through this game. I thought the
environment was really fresh relative to the last few Castlevania
games I've played and I enjoyed the partner system a lot, although
I felt like I didn't have as much use for <em>REDACTED</em>lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I'm really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don't think I will for a while.</p>

<p>My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn't beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn't finish the game.</p>
