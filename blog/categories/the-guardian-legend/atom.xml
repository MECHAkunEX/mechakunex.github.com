    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the first three or four areas of The Guardian
Legend.</p>

<p>I was very interested in this game because of its shooter and
Metroid-vania mixed gameplay. But it was a little bit of a let
down.</p>

<p>The shooter parts were pretty mediocre in my mind, but I think
they were probably pretty standard and reasonable for NES shooters
of the era. The main problem with it was that it felt totally
disconnected from the rest of the game. I was hoping that it would
be integrated more.</p>

<p>The exploration was fun seemed to really matter and be
meaningful. I would quibble that I think the map presentation
could have been better, but I can look at it as a product of its
time.</p>

<p>The action was basically the same as the walking areas in Blaster
Master. Almost a Zelda perspective but projectile based. It wasn't
very appealing to me. I can recognize that it was solid, but it
didn't have the special something that capture my attention.</p>

<p>Overall, it's not a game I plan on going back to, but it wasn't a
waste of time to try out for a while.</p>
