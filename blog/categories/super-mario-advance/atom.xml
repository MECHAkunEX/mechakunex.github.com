    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he'd play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn't have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn't beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you've conquered.</p>
