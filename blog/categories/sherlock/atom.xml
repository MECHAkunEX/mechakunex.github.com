    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch a new show and this was
recommended to us by some people. We watched it tonight on
Netflix. It was really awesome. Basically every scene was
amazing, clever, funny, etc. It had it all. I love that everyone
assumes they're a couple. It's cute.</p>
