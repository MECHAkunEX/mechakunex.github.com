    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I noticed today that I could download this for my Vita, since I
already bought it for the PS3 back in 2008, so I downloaded it
and showed it to my wife. I love the opening... fighting with
Richter and then the abilitease. It's great.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I thought I was going to play Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. I
got it all ready and played it... but it wasn't at all what I
expected.</p>

<p>First, a little background. My favourite part about Metal Gear is
sneaking without being noticed and without interacting with the
guards in any direct way. I dislike using weapons and I dislike
using chokes or throws. My least favourite parts of Metal Gear
games are when you are forced to interact---such as running up the
stairs in the 2nd and 3rd games in the series or the boss battles
in general.</p>

<p>I was expecting VR Missions to be hundreds of bite-sized
guard/room configurations I had to get through in this way. It is
sort of that, except that the vast majority of the content
revolves crucially around using weapons to kill the
enemies---going so far as to prevent the goal from appearing until
you destroy them.</p>

<p>I did all the No Weapon Sneaking mode missions in about twenty
minutes... looked through the other options... and decided to
ignore them and move on to the next game in the Metal Gear
series. I wonder if the MGS2 VR missions will be better?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've recently played through Tomba! over the past few weeks as my
"main" game.</p>

<p>This game defies categorization.</p>

<p>It's primarily a platforming game with a few accoutrements to
that basic experience: you get a number of different weapons, some
speed bonuses in form of new pants, and some utility items like a
grappling hook and a parasol (so you fall slower.) While the world
and gameplay in primarily 2D, you often need to jump into the
"background" and onto a different plane. Sometimes when you go
into the background the camera rotates to a different slice of a
3D area you're exploring. It's very neat mechanically.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the game is the mission system. As you
interact with the world and individuals in it, they inform you of
a problem. If and when you solve it, you gain AP and unlock
potentially more missions. Some of them are required, but
definitely not all of them. There are 130 in the game; I found 106
and cleared 87 of them. (I ended with 755,900 AP. I reckon this
isn't very much.)</p>

<p>Overall the game is very fun and unique. I imagine that Zelda II:
The Adventure of Link could have been like this game and moved the
Zelda series in a good direction rather the dead-end /Zelda II/
was. /Tomba!/ took me 4 hours and 27 minutes on the clock to beat,
but I would guess I probably spent closer to 2.5 times that amount
of time due to the difficulty of the platforming and bosses that
required reloading my save file.</p>

<p>I easily recommend it. Despite having typical PS1 loading time
problems, it's definitely worth it. I'm excited to play the sequel
eventually.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought this on the PS3 and played through up to the final
dungeon, but didn't want to grind to be able to get through it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of August, I played through FF7 for the first
time in a long time. It definitely is /not/ preserved as well as
Final Fantasy 6. The graphics are just ugly and
distracting. Additionally the game is filled with really annoying
minigames. Ugh. Nevertheless, the game is still pretty good.</p>
