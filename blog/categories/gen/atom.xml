    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to have a Genesis day and I played a lot of games. I
started off with this one... way it is unbelievably
terrible. It's interesting that it is trying to do the same as a
game like Gran Turismo... and obviously it utterly fails.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've heard a lot about this game and I thought it would be an
awesome action game like Ninja Gaiden, but with bigger and more
beautiful graphics. I was totally wrong. This is super boring and
the giant sprites do the gameplay a great dis-service by
preventing you from seeing enough of the screen to do anything
really effectively. I did not enjoy it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through this on Easy as Blaze and got to the final
boss. The combat feels pretty good in this game, but it has the
normal problems with beat-em-ups: the bosses are impossible unless
you use lots of special attacks, which are drastically
limited. I'm surprised I got so far. On my first continue, I got
to the end of Round 5. On my second, I got to the end of
Round 7. In the third, I got to the final boss. Definitely not
worth playing again, but it wasn't a terrible waste of an hour.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the first level of this game. Compared to Strider
it is a lot more interesting, but the hit detection and the speed
are way too painful to really enjoy. I also greatly disliked that
the attack was limited by a small amount of ammo.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the entire beginner version of this with the
girl. This is a classic beat-em-up at their worst. There's no
strategy to speak of and the bosses require quarters or repeated
usage of special attacks. Very boring.</p>
