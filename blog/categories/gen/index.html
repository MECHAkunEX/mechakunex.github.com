<h1><a href="/blog/2012/12/23/Game--Target-Earth--GEN--1990--0/">Game: Target Earth (GEN, 1990)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-12-23T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>23</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played this game in two chunks today. I saw the Encyclopedia
Bombastica entry about it and thought it looked neat.

In my first chunk, I played for about an hour and got to
stage 4. I played the first stage maybe ten times before I was
able to do anything. The game has a steep learning curve in terms
of controlling your mecha and understanding how weak the mecha
is. The key seems to be going very slowly, so that you can
recharge. I feel like it is reminiscent, in a way, to a game like
Vanquish, where it is essential to stay with your squad.

In my second chunk, I played for a bit more than an hour and beat
it. The story was mildly interesting and the final levels seemed
easier because you had more stuff, but still challenging.

I think the hardest level was the first low-gravity one where you
had to defend the ships and then get into one of them by the
end. I couldn't guard them effectively, but I realized that if I
kept one off-screen, I could continually dodge and then get into
at the last second without it being destroyed.

I really enjoyed the game once I got into it. The chunky feel of
the game felt purposeful and interesting. The aiming system that
encouraged you to stay still was neat. The progression system was
a nice touch.

I think my only really problem was that most of the weapons had
such limited ammo, that I conserved them to the point of never
using them. I used the spread shot a few times in the
beginning. I used the grenade launcher once. Once I got the
missile pods, I used them to defeat the last few bosses. I think
the game could have been better by having a different special
weapon system. For example, you could decide between different
shapes and then the other weapons would be power-ups that you'd
have to find in the level and they might be permanent after that,
or have a time-limit (so you are compelled to blast with them.)
Or, they could have made it so it was essential to use them, so
you had to figure out to use them properly. As it was, they felt
so valuable that I never experimented with them enough to learn
how they worked.

Another thing that could have been better was providing another
way to deal with enemies that were incredibly close to you. There
were many times when I was just covered and enemies and couldn't
do anything because the bullets appeared on the screen passed the
mob. Perhaps a melee weapon would have been the trick?

In any case, this was a very fun game.

<div class="entry-content">I've heard a lot about this game and I thought it would be an
awesome action game like Ninja Gaiden, but with bigger and more
beautiful graphics. I was totally wrong. This is super boring and
the giant sprites do the gameplay a great dis-service by
preventing you from seeing enough of the screen to do anything
really effectively. I did not enjoy it.

<div class="entry-content">I played through this on Easy as Blaze and got to the final
boss. The combat feels pretty good in this game, but it has the
normal problems with beat-em-ups: the bosses are impossible unless
you use lots of special attacks, which are drastically
limited. I'm surprised I got so far. On my first continue, I got
to the end of Round 5. On my second, I got to the end of
Round 7. In the third, I got to the final boss. Definitely not
worth playing again, but it wasn't a terrible waste of an hour.

it is a lot more interesting, but the hit detection and the speed

<div class="entry-content">I've never played this puzzle game before. There's nothing too
wrong with it as a concept, but I find it very difficult to enjoy
puzzle games like this for a long time. They would really be best
as rotating little games in a larger context. This particular
version of the Columns concept, however, feels really broken.

As you get jewels, it gets faster and faster. It gets so fast that
you can't think at all and the best you can do it plan one move
ahead and then rotate the blocks as they've just landed to make
the most of the situation. It actually feels like you're not
really making decisions and are winning randomly.

I was able to make it 22 levels and there were many times I
basically gave up but randomly got triples that totally changed
my luck. Weird.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/04/13/Game--Gunstar-Heroes--GEN--1993--0/">Game: Gunstar Heroes (GEN, 1993)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I'm a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I'd never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It's really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn't have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.

[This review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335) of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn't do better. Check that out.

When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, "This looks
cool." That's a good sign.

  <h2>2009</h2>

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/11/26/Game--World-of-Illusion--GEN--1992--0/">Game: World of Illusion (GEN, 1992)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-11-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Wifey and I just beat World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck for the Genesis. This is a two player platformer
released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. It is really fun that you
have to cooperate with another person: sometimes you need to stand
on each other's shoulders, pull the other player through a small
hole, or use a handcar together. There is also friendly fire in
the game, which is definitely exciting and forces you to really
communicate.

We played through all but the final level in one go a few weeks
ago, but we lost all our tries right near the end and waited until
tonight to finish it. We got back through all those parts and to
the final boss, but he creamed us up front. The problem was that
we didn't know where to attack him. This is typical of this game:
it does a very poor job communicating to you what you need to do
to advance. For example, there are these doors in the final area
that are very hard to open because you don't know what button to
press. Simple, but annoying.

Overall, the game is a nice quick platforming experience and I
think my wife liked it; and that's saying something! I can't wait to
play through the new Super Mario Brothers for the Wii with her.

We used Save States in the final area to conserve lives, but beat
the final boss on one try.
