    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played a bunch of Double Dragon the other day.</p>

<p>This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,
playing through a bunch of it recently really made it seem pretty
lame. I pretty much steam-rolled the game up through the end of
Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.</p>
