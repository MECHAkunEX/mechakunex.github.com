    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.</p>

<p>There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn't check who you needed to
still visit.</p>

<p>All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.</p>
