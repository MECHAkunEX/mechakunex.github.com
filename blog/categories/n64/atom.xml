    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few nights, I've played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren't done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I'm stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren't displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I'm not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I've seen, it isn't Treasure's best work, but I'm glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For almost the past two months, I have been playing Sin and
Punishment: Hoshi no Keishōsha every day. In the beginning, I
could only get through about 15 minutes of the game, so it fit
well into my rotation. As I got towards the end, I would play
every day, get to right before the final boss and die, losing
about 45 minutes of my life every time. But! I loved it so much!
It is so satisfying to play this game and slowly get better at
getting through each boss, each segment; learning how to get more
and more enemies and points. At times I feel like I'm playing a
beautiful piano piece that I've practiced for so long.</p>

<p>When I started playing, I didn't know about the sword or that you
could knock back projectiles at enemies, so once I learned I
quickly got past some of my previous bottlenecks. My favourite
part of the game is when you control Airan: running through the
ship with her, fighting Leda, going on the chase, and destroying
the fleet is just so... EPIC! Then, the subway sequence is really
fun, but honestly, not as cool as the ship sequence. The first and
second parts with Saki are fine, but the side-scrolling final
stage is awesome. The difficulty in the game is perfect. Even
though I got through the final boss on my first try, it was insane
and frenetic. I ended with about 564 hit points left on the Earth,
which started around 30k, so I clearly didn't do an amazing
job. But it was awesome.</p>

<p>The music is great for its era (although wifey reports that she
got pretty tired of it.) The visuals hold up very well actually,
because everything is so big. Ya, the textures in the backgrounds
are really blurry, but it actually gives an apocalyptic and fast
paced feel. The controls are really smooth... although I didn't
play on a N64 controller. (I used the best controller ever aka
arcade stick. I mapped the top three buttons to: strafe left,
fire, strafe right, lock-on/manual. Then the bottom left button to
jump so that I just laid my hand down and never had to move it. I
feel like the game was easier this way because I used more digits
than the N64 controller would "fit.") I love the pacing and the
simple (but interesting) scoring system.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for the sequel, Sin and Punishment: Sora no Kōkeisha
to come out. If it doesn't make it over, I'll definitely have to
import a Japanese Wii or something to play it. I heart it.</p>

<p>Now the final business: My score. I played on Easy for this first
play-through. (I will do Normal soon.) I got 44,214,705 points,
spent 46 minutes and 41 seconds and got 2033 enemies. This is all
on one credit, of course.</p>

<p>Love it!</p>
