    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I play this a bit pretty much every time I got to the
bathroom. I'm stuck at a pretty standard score---I can get to the
first few red enemies. I still feel like the game's control would
be so much better with real buttons, etc. I've noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/">This interesting review</a> has some
observations I had too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like Tim Rogers and read a few reviews of this, so I got
it the week it came out. I played for about 5 minutes. So far it
is okay, but I feel like it be so much better with real buttons
and a D-pad. It is a very non-intuitive control scheme and clearly
contrived into what the iPhone can do. Ugh. I hate iPhone
games. I'll try it again, but at a first glance I appear to have
been duped again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I'll play it again unless I'm totally desperate. I'd rather
just read something on my phone. I don't blame this game though, I
think it's really the fault of the phone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I'd heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.</p>

<p>I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven't
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won't play it
again.</p>

<p>I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.</p>

<p>I'm glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don't like it. It's too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.</p>
