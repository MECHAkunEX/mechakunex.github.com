    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we saw Ballet West perform The Nutcracker, for our second
time. I had seen it one other time (that I can remember) performed
by the Boston Ballet.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with Sayaka for her Doll and Mirlitons. I
love the Doll because the choreography seems to be so precise,
quick, and on pointe all the time. I like the Mirlitons because
there are relatively few dancers, but they have interesting lines
and there's lots of the kind of ballet (pointe) I like.</p>

<p>Christiana was the Sugar Plum Fairy and was amazing. I love her
solo in the Grand Pas de Deux, because she shows such power and
grace by herself (i.e. without support.) I really like the cute
leg flips (I need to learn the terms) at the beginning of the
piece.</p>

<p>I really enjoy seeing this after I've been reading the ballet
history book. It was cool to see so many little things that I've
learned where they came from.</p>
