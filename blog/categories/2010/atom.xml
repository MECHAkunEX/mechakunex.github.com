    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played a few levels tonight and finished Area 6. I found a lot
of the levels to be really difficult to have two people, because
they use forced scrolling and the timed barrel jumps, which
require a lot more synchronization than is reasonable between two
people. Overall, the game seems to have multiplayer as an after
thought, especially with the varied capabilities of the two
players. The boss of Area 6 was very exciting to beat with my
wife, we were yelling and jumping out of our seats as we
recognized tells of the boss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn't move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don't think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I beat the level---The Coil. It was horrible. The first time
I beat it---after almost an hour---I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus' castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've decided to retire this game for a while. I haven't really
been playing that much even though I have it scheduled and kind of
want to. I think I need to start again from the beginning with no
assists. I only have the Endurance Races, the Formula GT races,
and the Special Events to get Golds on, but I don't want to spend
the time on the Endurance ones and the Formula/Special events are
so technical, I think my skills just aren't up to the task. I
think I need to re-learn to play. I'm going to put it on my
schedule to play it again in January and give it another try. I
can't believe how much and how long I've played this game. It's
sooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie was suggested by Netflix and I wasn't sure I would like
it. As we watched it, it was pretty cute and touching. It was very
reminiscent of how my wife and I were when we first met... fell in
love over the course of 10 days and then didn't see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years
and years past... it was a very depressing and unhappy ending.</p>
