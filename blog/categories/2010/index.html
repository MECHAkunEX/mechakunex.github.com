because the ballet innovations there didn't drastically change
things. I'm excited about the transition to the Russian world.

<div class="entry-content">This whole chapter seems to be about Marie Taglioni and she sounds
amazing.

If Vestris designed the steps that became modern ballet, she
figured out how to do them with the style expect of modern
ballerinas. She did everything that Vestris did, but she practiced
so long and hard to achieve the strength necessary to do it in an
"elegant" and "feminine" way. While the early dancers were
"sweaty" and "breathless" when they did them, she was
"angelic". She built this technique over 6 months after a failed
start in Vienna by working for 6 hours a day and holding poses for
100 seconds.

Her shoes are still extant and have been studied. While she
performed full pointe, she mainly held herself at full point and
did not dance on it. We know this because her shoes were not the
boxed and hard style that allows that. Instead, by looking at the
wearing at the shoes, it looks like she danced about half-way
between half-pointe and full-pointe. Her dancing was so powerful
that she used 2 or 3 shoes per performance.

<div class="entry-content">I just read one of the most interesting sections so far. It
discussed how in the 1820s, a ballet master named Vestris
dramatically changed the art.

He took the old three different genres of ballet and combined all
their steps into a new genre---that is modern ballet. This had lots
of big consequences. The old notation systems didn't work any
longer and weren't replaced because of the complexity of the new
dances.

The old style of practice was forgotten and replaced. Before, whole
dances were done continuously for practice, but after individual
steps were repeated dozens of times before going on to more
steps. The various steps were ranked in order of difficulty. For
example, in Vestris' notes it says there were 27 different kinds
of pirouettes. 

In particular, the role of the male dancer changed a lot. Vestris
innovated the male dancer as acrobat doing many jumps and
turns. This was seen as very wild and distasteful. In addition,
the new style he came up with was perfected by women, so part of
his innovation led to male dancers becoming pariahs and not a
major part of ballet. In fact, in the mid 1800s, many male roles
were played by women! This is funny to me because a hundred years
before, the opposite was true.

<div class="entry-content">Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.

Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don't
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff. 

Normal games can't be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don't give instant, infinite
respawns.

This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next. 

(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)

Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them... it is horrifically bad.

<div class="entry-content">It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like "plays" but
should be like "paintings", because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can't express detailed, dynamic
stories... everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable... like a painting.

<div class="entry-content">I read most of the first chapter today, although I decided it was
a bit long and I should break my reading into smaller chunks. It
was very interesting to read about the philosophical origins of
the art. The idea that entertainment before was more loud and that
ballet was distinguished by silence is cool. The Feuillet notation
is crazy to read... it looks so meaningless to me. The debate
about whether dance should be considered part of music is curious,
especially given modern university organization. Finally, reading
about all the ways male dance was preferred to female dance is
very strange to a modern, such as myself.

<div class="entry-content">I read the introduction today. I was very interested to learn that
the current ballet canon is very Russian, but made by a French guy,
and very late in the life of ballet. The concept of there being
very little data about the past of ballet is curious. I like the
idea that the story of this book will focus on the steps and forms
themselves. It seems like a style I would be most intrigued by.

<div class="entry-content">I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn't
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn't (Craig's conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts' character was very cute,
although we don't learn anything about her, other than that she's
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don't really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.

<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I ended just before the final cut-off point to the final
bosses and end of the game. I finished the game today in about an
hour. Today as I started to play, I left the title screen on for a
while... it was very beautiful as the time of day changed.

I thought the end of the game was fun and crazy. It was so
incredibly Evangelion and so classically Japanese, like I said
before, but even more so given the ending---everyone you thought
was good is actually bad and everyone that was bad is really good,
and all that. I especially liked walking around in space and the
origin story given to Zanza. It was also neat how Dickson ended
up.

Total time: 26:36

--

In the end, I feel like this was a really interesting story and
world, but a pretty terrible game. The mechanics were just very
shallow and boring, lacking in meaningful choices. I think you
could do something with the concepts in the combat system, but
they didn't really do it. One thing that I reckon WoW does that
this game lacks is that because you need to assemble large groups
with varied skills, there is an interesting meta-process of doing
that, but it is still ultimately boring for the individual
players.

I heard so much about how amazing this game was and how it was so
great that Japanese developers were learning from the West, but I
feel like all the Western ideas here are bad ideas that I don't
want to see more of.

I really disliked that every item changed your appearance because
it was hard to look consistent while having the best
stats. Everyone just looked so stupid generally.

The interface was pretty terrible because it took so many clicks
to do everything and the buttons were reversed from what they
should be on the controller. Ugh.

I don't think I can really recommend this game... maybe I would
just recommend watching some videos and reading about the story,
but I found the mechanics to be unbearably weak.

<div class="entry-content">I played for like four hours tonight. The ending of this game is
classic Japanese insanity where you fight God and conquer your
fate. The changing alliances and what not at the end of the game
are pretty crazy too. I like a lot of what went on and it is very
intriguing in its Evangelion-ness. Some of the boss battles are
getting to be very tedious slog fests.

<div class="entry-content">I played for like three hours tonight. There's been lots of crazy
reveals in the game, some that have been obvious for a long time
and others that were just cool. Getting on to Mechonis was
awesome. It was crazy to see the new map screen. Rad.

Some of the main-line fetch quests in this game are absurd. You
walk through an area and then get to the end are given a fetch
quest where you walk all the way back across the area. It's
totally insane.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours tonight. I got to the gate of Prison
Island. The whole High Entia concept is pretty cool... especially
that there is this giant civilization that's totally disconnected
from others beneath it on the monster. The message at the Tomb was
very interesting too... I wonder what the ancestor's plans were
regarding the genetic destiny of their people?

I really enjoyed seeing the waterfall in the forest. It was very
magnificent. My son was very impressed too.

Exploring the Entia capital was very confusing because the arrow
points in the direction of the destination, not the teleporter
that you have to use to get to it. It was very confusing. When I
was exploring these big empty places with very same-y textures and
models, it made me think how much this game is like mid to late
PS2 games in terms of what it tries to do technically. Rather than
having detailed environments, it often has very large environments
with big draw distances as a way to show, for example.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours tonight. I did a lot of exploring and
got into the mines. I've decided that the game play in this really
sucks:

Basically the only task that you do in combat as a player is
click on the 8 buttons for the different skills. There's no real
reason to do any skill at any particular time, because status
effects will either stack or not and by the time one runs out,
you can just cast it again. So basically, everyone combat starts
by clicking everything and then waiting until you can click them
all again in sequence. Occasionally you have to remember to use
Enchant when you're fighting Mechon and to move around a little
after killing each enemy so you're in range, but you really don't
need to give any of it much more thought than that. I can tell
that no more strategy is required because I can basically walk
through the game up to this point, doing this strategy, and
winning basically every fight. I've only lost if I got into a
fight that was way over level or I was too close to two groups of
enemies and they joined together. It's very uninteresting.

Outside of combat, there also isn't that much to do because each
character basically only has 10 or so abilities and they are all
so meh and I can't imagine really caring one way or another about
why you'd pick one versus the other.

I can't really understand why a lot of people gave this game such
high reviews. It pales in comparison to other RPGs like FF13 or
Lost Odyssey, where there are actually interesting choices to
make in combat. I've read so much that the game is so good
because it takes (presumably "good") Western ideas and mixes them
with Japanese design. Man, this Western design, if it means the
combat system, is total junk. I've read that it's very similar to
WoW... now I'm sure I wouldn't like WoW.

I've tried to think of why I feel like it's different than FF12,
which was very MMO-ish. I think the reason why it is different is
the Gambits. Basically in FF12, Gambits automated what the player
is "doing" in Xenoblade. Since that was necessarily going on, the
game was free to through bigger challenges on top of those and
have lots of split second usage of the special moves, which
constituted a really large set. In Xenoblade, you never feel like
you died because of lack of strategy, you feel like you died
because of stupid AI or not enough grinding. Whereas in FF12, I
could die, gain some knowledge from the experience, restart and
immediately win the battle, because I knew something I didn't
know before. With Xenoblade (so far), the only reason you didn't
grind enough or you fell asleep with an active fight.

Xenoblade has caused me to think about RPG combat systems at the
meta-level a bit. In Xeno, you have 8 skills, each with separate
cool-downs, so basically every 30 seconds you are using skill A
and since you can spawn so many at once, basically, there are
little bursts of doing a lot of skills followed by waiting around
for the skills to be reusable. In contrast, in a traditional
JRPG, there are about 30 or 40 skills (i.e. magic spells,
summons, attack techniques, etc) plus items. Each skill has a
cost of some kind so you can't always choose it (summons are once
per battle, items are limited, spells use MP, etc.) But you can
only do one action every 5 seconds when your turn comes up. Since
every character is on their own timer and the enemies are acting
to. There is always one thing happening and you can always pay
attention to it (if it is a player, you're picking it, and if it
is an enemy, you're thinking about how to respond.) In contrast,
with Xeno, there's a lot going at once so you can't pay attention
and the decisions that you make are basically non-existent. Once
you choose the initial skill order, there's no reason to do
anything except use the skills again once they cool down. All
strategy takes place in the first few seconds and then you're
just doing a rote execution. In addition, the number of skills in
the traditional JRPG makes it so the solution space is much large
so it can more difficult to plan. (For example, you have the
elemental affinities, healing spells, buffs, etc.)

Xenoblade is just a really boring game combat-wise and the
meta-game is very tedious and/or confusing. I'm really let down
by this because the game was so hyped.

However, I'm incredibly compelled by the world and the story. It's
so strange and interesting. I want to play the game just to
experience that, provided it won't cost 50 hours. I wonder if I
can easily speed my way through the game without any grinding or
BS and if I'll be able to bear it long enough.

This conclusion makes most nervous about Last Story which I have
been equally (actually /more/ hyped about.) We'll see.

<div class="entry-content">[This action button review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p%3D2597) of the game captures my feelings about a
lot of the system-overload this game throws at you so early and
the sheer weight of the quests. The comment about the difference
between abilities and skills is very apt---I have no clue what's
going on in that system. Something related is that for a lot of
the game so far I've been killing every enemy in my path, but then
I noticed that a lot of the enemies are just giving me 1 or 2
EXP... what's the point of that? But there doesn't seem to be a
good way to tell what is going to be a good amount of EXP before
hand. It's a bit confusing.

Today, I played for a little over three hours. I advanced the
story quite a bit. I was really annoyed by the lack of a feeling
of progress behind all the numbers. I repeatedly tried to get
past a little path that was blocked by enemies and I seemed to be
dying with no explanation.

I went back to the gem guy to create a whole bunch of gems, but I
don't really know if they are really all that good or if I
shouldn't have spent them all, because I have a lot of gems now
and not enough places to put them.

I'm really conflicted about the battle system. In some ways, it's
no different than a traditional FF or DQ game, because you
generally attack and then use special attacks when you have
enough energy to. But on the other hand, it feels like a lot of
meaningful decision is taken from you. For example, there's an
air of strategy in your positioning, but with huge crowds of
enemies it is so hard to see where you are, where their face is,
etc that being in the front/back/side is almost irrelevant
because you can't reliably tell. The whole
Monado-tells-the-future system being integrated into the combat
is really remarkable and unique. I'm not yet to the point though
where the vision really does me any good because I don't
understand how it is supposed to be canceled.

Basically, at this point, I find the whole game to be really
confusing in the mechanic department. There's a lot that I can do
and I'm treating it like a traditional JRPG, but I feel like I'm
missing something when I do, but I'm not really being punished
for ignoring it, but I'm constantly being flirted with by all
these other weird numbers and concepts. It's just a really
strange game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight. I have a few thoughts
about my experiences tonight...

- The controls are really annoying. It is very weird that A is
the confirm button on the Wii Pro controller, because it is in
the cancel spot. There should have been a way to change.

- The user interface is really painful. There's a big loading
time to do everything. The equipment management system is
really annoying---you can't equip from a shop and when you
change equipment, the gems don't automatically get unequipped
and I haven't found a way to remove them other than putting the
thing back on and removing it from there. It's really
painful. The quick travel system is really slow too because you
have to go so deep in the menus.

- I'm amazed that the killed off what seemed like a main
character after giving you the opportunity to spend /a lot/ of
money on her to give a special bikini outfit. I didn't realize
it would be a wasted expense.

- The graphics are quite good for some Wii games, but feel really
bad in other ways. I think this is most noticeable when they
show faces, because they are totally flat. The environments are
really beautifully constructed and I love how open they are.

- The combat system is pretty interesting. I still don't feel
like I totally understand all my choices, but I have a bit of a
technique worked out that is being useful so far.

- The story is pretty compelling and the world is very bizarre
and fascinating for it.

<div class="entry-content">I started this game tonight. The opening sequence is really cool,
especially after the battle when it pulls out and shows you how
people live on the two giant titans. It's such a cool concept.

The battle system I experienced during the walk to the first
village was incredibly reminiscent of FF12, but with a bit more
action on the part of the player. When I got to the town, it was
incredibly tempting to go and find all the glowing blue things
and get all the quests, etc. I can tell that it will be hard to
not make this game a giant collect-a-thon for myself.

I'm finding the mechanics a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of
different options about how to equip characters, so many quests,
so many different ways to buy things. It's very intimidating. I
think I will do the obvious thing until it hurts me rather than
trying to compute what the best solution will be.

I was amazed at how many different quests I unlocked so early,
though.

The voice acting in this game is actually really good. I almost
never like non-Japanese voice acting, because it is normally just
so horrendous. (Actually, now that I think about, Asura's Wrath
was pretty good.) Since the actors in this game are British,
there's something really fun and exotic about them. I like it.

I'm pretty excited to be playing this game. (One annoyance: I'm
using the Wii Pro controller. I hate having to have it plugged in
to the Wiimote that sits stupidly next to me on the couch.)

<div class="entry-content">Today we played for an hour and a half-ish. We beat the game! The
final boss and the last rocket sequence was pretty tough and my
wife was getting very frustrated, but we eventually did it.

The Nintendo Channel clocks our total time at 20 hours and 52
minutes (I haven't been keeping track of our game play that long.)

We decided that the game is a lot more sloppy in many ways
compared to NSMBW, but that we had a lot of fun, especially once
we got infinite lives. We don't love the game enough to try to get
all the bonuses to unlock the hidden temple, so that's that.

I like platformers, but I like playing games with my wife more.

World 8. There was a normal platforming level (although it had
lots of breaking platforms), then a rocket level, then a mine-cart
level. The rocket levels are so terrible because they are just
memorization mazes with an awful control scheme. It was

now, because we can play a little less cautiously and give my

<div class="entry-content">We finished watching it.

The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend's commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too... like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.

The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning... it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.

I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!

<div class="entry-content">This is a fine little romance. The most interesting thing about it
is how this, and other movies (like the Chaplin biopic) rewrite the
history of the Communist/Hollywood controversy of the 50s to play
out the way that modern Hollywood people wish that it would. It
makes me think that maybe some people wouldn't realize that
Hollywood didn't really "win". There's a lot of Hollywood
dopey-eye-ism in the movie, actually. It reminds me a lot of
Hugo.

I think the movie might have been improved by making it more
ambiguous about whether Jim Carrey really lost his memory.

The reviews are interesting. I think Roger Ebert saw what it was
going for and believed in it. The speech at the end was a bit too
dopey for my taste.

voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the

up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.

Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, "Well, I think this should be the last try

course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.

Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.

Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.

Snow's conversation with Katniss: very believable.

Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?

Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.

<div class="entry-content">I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.

The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.

The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I'm glad that the characters realize this
too.

It's funny because when she's in the field, it's like she's in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.

The real moment of Katniss' catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.

The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.

I find the term "Mockingjay" used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.

Katniss' impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)

I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.

I'm stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol... tense!

<div class="entry-content">This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film. 

I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they're
fighting fear itself, but there's no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.

The movie's version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.

he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.

<div class="entry-content">I've been reading this book for a few weeks. It's just
terrible.

It's about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of *REDACTED* and then a series of questions underneath it
like "What does X mean?" "What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?" "What does Y mean?" etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say "follow the
Prophet" and the questions will be something like "What does it
/really/ mean to follow?" "No, REALLY what does it mean?"

I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn't want to
express them clearly because he's afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.

Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he's implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn't actually say this.

In addition to this frivolous questions, there's saccharine
comments like, "Man this Book of *REDACTED* is pretty important, huh? I
can't believe it's so great" that sound like staged humility.

It's plausible that this guy's other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don't think he can use the commentary format effectively.

<div class="entry-content">I played another 30-ish minutes of the game. I decided that I'm
not interested enough in this game to play it. The story seems
fine, maybe a bit cliche. The interesting thing to me was the
setting of the intro movie, which was abandoned pretty instantly
and now I'm on random medieval planet (like the first three
games.) I'll ignore a boring story if the gameplay is awesome,
but...

I can't remember what the combat system was like for the third
game (I remember liking it, but I feel like it was similar to
this) but I'm not compelled by this one at all. It's a cross
between way too easy and way too frustrating. For example, most
battles can be won by simply pressing X over and over. There's a
"blindside" system, but it's basically impossible to use when you
are ganged up on, and when you aren't ganged up on, you can just
time your attacks to never need to dodge. It's frustrating that
you can't really use it well. The targeting system is really
frustrating because it never seems to go where you want and
there's no way to lock on to a target. The field is really bad,
because sometimes you'll run at an enemy from behind, but the hit
detection is off, so you end up getting them from the side and you
get a Surprise attack, even though you clearly snuck up on them
from behind. Argh! The controls in combat are really laggy with
hidden timers or something. This is the worst when it comes to
jumping. You'll hit the button and then have a noticeable delay
before the jump happens. 

The game aspires to feel like a third-person action game, but it's
not good enough at it to make the comparison a good thing. It
pales in comparison to Bayonetta. I don't think I have the time
and interest to play 50 hours (the median time on
HowLongToBeat.com) of something that is not totally amazing.

I'm glad I've played tri-Ace games released after this, because I
can imagine that if I played this on release, I would be skeptical
of their ability to continue to deliver hits. But, Resonance of
Fate was amaaaazing, so tri-Ace still has it.

So long, Star Ocean.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven't
really been captured by it. I'm not sure why. The combat system
doesn't seem as advanced as I'd like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I'll keep playing, but I'm a bit sad I
haven't been totally won over by it.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
"Inn" to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.

In a small way I've been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There's just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.

I think doing one "episode" per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.

<div class="entry-content">I've played the first and third Star Ocean games and really
enjoyed them. I generally like everything that tri-Ace does, so
I'm looking forward to this game. I like the idea of the enhanced
PS3 version, but I don't really know anything about the game or
about what is enhanced about this release.

--

I played for about an hour in my first session. The concept of the
world is pretty cool. It's the first Star Ocean I can think of
that has Earth as a real place. I wonder if it is supposed to be
in the same continuity as the other games? The gameplay seems like
it will be cool. The battle system tutorial was incredibly
complicated and I did during the battle three times before
winning. That makes me hopeful, although a little bit of the time
I felt like I was losing because I couldn't target the thing I
wanted. The graphics are pretty good, although the characters are
verrry anime-y and from some angles their clothes really clash
with their faces. (For example, the guy on the computer screen
that Edge talks to.) The controls are responsive.  Although the
camera controls are a little too "tight" for my taste so far. I
got a little stuck walking around in the space ship. I think the
problem is that the world is so "bright" that it's hard to notice
something you can bump into. Anyways, the majority of the time was
spent in videos, so I don't really have a good feel for the game
yet.

<div class="entry-content">I decided based on some consultation with forum posts, etc, that I
will watch a long play of the game, rather than play through it
myself. The gameplay is so bad and I want to see everything, but
don't want to play with a walkthrough. It's more efficient to just
watch it. I found two playthroughs: [a 100% playthrough](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D3368004) and [[http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/deadly-premonition/5058/endurance-run-download-urls/417644/][a
GiantBomb Endurance Run]]. I'm not sure which one will be better, so
I'll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We'll see how that goes...

<div class="entry-content">I bought this game because I heard so many good things about it on
podcasts, particularly the "WARNING: A Huge Podcast"
special. Before playing it, I'm slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won't want to. (I don't want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don't bother me because there's just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn't finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I'm
giving it a chance, but if it doesn't take me in one night, I
don't think I'll keep playing it.

--

I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn't hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it's all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.

The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the "gas stand" is.)

The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don't really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it's disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it's also not very effective. There's not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.

The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.

It's a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don't
think I'll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I'm slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I'll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I'll give it more time.

I never noticed in the others that you need to beat a relatively

<div class="entry-content">This movie is on par with the last one and perhaps a slight step
down. It is much less globe-trotting, with essentially four
sets---the Tokyo office (small), Alaska (small), the LA Prison
(large), and the Arcadia (small).

The opening fight is caraaaazy and has a lot of the elements of the
third movie where you think you're watching *the Alice* but
aren't. I was disappointed that Alice lost her powers almost
instantly, but I think it is probably good for the movie that she
lost them, because they make her too unstoppable... but it still
fun to have her as a super hero. They don't explain at all how she
recovers from the crash, separates from Wesker, doesn't reconnect
to her supplies / more clones in Nevada, etc. But whatever :)

The Claire pick-up is kind of strange at the time, but the
resolution of what she was doing is pretty awesome by the end of
the movie. It was a genuine surprise and I liked it a lot. By the
way, Ali Larter. Wow.

One of the worst things about this movie is how horrible the actor
who plays Wesker is. He's way to stiff and "too cool for school". I
can see what he was going for... by not moving very much he's
trying to act above the situation, but it comes across as really
stupid.

The ultimate action of the movie is strange because it is
practically a meaningless excursion---only Chris and Luther survive
and Luther barely does. It doesn't really do anything to advance
the mythos, just that Wesker is a tough guy and Umbrella continues
to experiment on people. I'd like them pursue that fact that really
only Umbrella has a chance of saving the world and if they weren't
such punks, Alice should be helping them. What does she expect to
do? She really has no motivation besides revenge and helping out
survivors (but mostly they just die because she's around.) I found
it interesting in the beginning that she clearly blames herself for
the outbreak. Is she referring to planning a robbery? Or being
involved in the first movie? It's unclear what she is talking
about.

The new kinds of zombies in this movie are interesting and appear
with almost no notice by the characters. The "Majini" zombies are
super creepy. The big "butcher" guy was weird; I expected him to be
like a rogue Nemesis, but they don't really go into at all.

The ending is pretty insane. First, Wikipedia says that a figure
parachutes away from the explosion of Wesker's plane, but I didn't
see that. (Just watched a video of that and it's pretty clear. When
I first saw the ending, I didn't realize what the smudge in the
background was, but now it is clear.) Weird. Second, every movie
ends with an opening for the next movie, but 2 and 3 end of very
happy resolutions. 1 is less happy, but still Alice is in a
position of control and power. This ending is a pretty bad
cliff-hanger because they are literally about to be blown
away. Where are all these Umbrella goons hiding? It was not at all
clear to me that the woman in command of the attack was Jill
Valentine, because she had different hair color. Weird. (I watched
the ending again and it still doesn't look like her, but the voice
sounds just like her.)

As I was watching, my PS3 detected a Cinavia watermark. What cool
technology! I had to switch to watching on the PC.

It is interesting that this movie made significantly more money
than the others. Good for them. The production value is definitely
up from the others. (Although I'd say that only the second was
"bad" on that front. The first wasn't good, but I think it was good
for its time.)

Regarding the Wikipedia summary of the reception: I agree that
there is a large amount of slow motion which seems incredibly
tedious---especially in Claire's fight in the shower. The action is
slower paced in general, but I think that is good, because you can
appreciate it more.

<div class="entry-content">I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly---every two days---and I haven't stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game... i.e. got to the ending sequence... on
September 30th, but I've been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. [Here's a video commentary](http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b) of the whole
normal game.

This is a brilliant game. It's amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren't reflected in the replay. If that's the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.

Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a "puzzle". It's not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren't logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It's very neat and you don't need to have it
explained that you are racing, it's so obvious when you start.

The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+... a game I really loved... on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.

Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you'd done before.

I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It's an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/27/Game--Gran-Turismo-5--PS3--2010--2/">Game: Gran Turismo 5 (PS3, 2010) (3)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I bought Gran Turismo 5 for Christmas for my dad and I. I'd never
really been super into a racing game before, although I played a
racing game for the SNES and I got a diddly wheel for the PS1 to
play Ridge Racer with. I remember going over Sean's house and
seeing his brother play Gran Turismo 1, but it's always been in my
periphery since then. I'd been hearing a lot about how awesome the
game was and how demanding it was of your skill, so I decided to
make it a new hobby. Due to the flood, it took until some time in
January to start playing regularly. After getting started with the
controller I decided that I needed a racing wheel and a stand for
it. That was a really good idea, because it made the game so much
more awesome.

From January to September, I played the game every day. For the
first two-ish months I would play for about an hour or so, but
after that I would just do one race/event per night. After
September, I've been playing every two-ish days. After getting up
to the Extreme series in Spec A, I switched to closing out all the
Spec B races. In each case, I would not proceed until I got a gold
on every event (although I delayed a pre-Extreme event because it
was very very difficult.) After closing out the Spec B, I went
back and finished the other Extreme events. My statistics right
now are:

A-Spec Level: 28
B-Spec Level: 40
Game Progress: 95 %
Current Credits: 13,585,072
Total Wins: 303
No. of Cars Owned: 135
Trophies Earned: 50 %
Total Distance Driven: 42,292.1 Miles
Licenses: S (Gold: 25; Silver: 8; Bronze: 27)

Right now, I only have one Spec A event in Extreme left... the
Formula GT races (which are incredibly difficult) and all the Spec
A Endurance races. Plus I'd like to go back and get gold in every
License test and I haven't done many Special Events.

However, I'm at the point where every task left in the game
(i.e. the 5% of the game that remains) is excruciatingly difficult
and often very time consuming. For example, each Formula GT race
takes about 30 minutes and you need to do six of them to win the
event. You can save the game in between races, but you can't
tackle the courses piecemeal. The Endurance races were incredibly
tedious even on Spec B (which is AI controlled)... I can't imagine
how horrible they would be in Spec A.

Given how much time I've played the game... obviously it is
amazing. I wish there were more of the average difficulty races,
because I'm now at the depressing stage of playing the game more
and more. Basically, I wish I could play the game for ever and
keep making incremental progress, whereas right now I feel like I
need to jump a really big wall.

Overall, my favourite thing about the game was the nice difficulty
curve that made you always feel like you were improving and the
general skill that I feel like I've acquired because of it. It's
almost like a shmup in a sense, because you have to gain personal
skill to do well. There were some awesome moments at the beginning
of the game when I was shaving milliseconds of trial times to get
a gold trophy. It was very satisfying to do. Sometimes though it
feels like you just need to get a better car to even have a chance
at certain races and it is hard to tell when that is. I think the
UI could be improved to give you some indication that your car is
very weak relative to the competition. Eventually I started using
a guide to recommend which cars to get... because there are so
many it is hard to decide what to buy at any one time.

The graphics and sound are amazing, as expected. The
side-of-the-road textures are really bad when you are going slow
(because you are terrible) but at the right speed they are
great. I had a little bit of screen tearing, but I get the feeling
it was something with my TV rather than the game. My favourite
tracks were the forest tracks where you got to see the interplay
of shadows and light. Very beautiful.

When I was doing Spec B at the end, I found the RPG side of the
game... getting credits and cars and upgrades to be strangely
satisfying. I can't reiterate enough how absurd the Endurance
races are. There are 9, 12, 24 hour, etc races. It is
ridiculous. I would leave the game on over night or all day to
just finish them once I knew I had a strong enough driver, car,
and pit-strategy to just win with no effort. I wish there were a
"Simulate until the end of the race" button. The worst was
grinding the XP to get to the final race. I was a little annoyed
that nothing happened when I beat every single Spec B race.

I will continue playing the game. The main question is whether I
keep pushing at the remaining 5% or if I select the part of the
game that I like and keep doing it over and over. Probably a
balance of the two. However, I don't think it would be possible
for me to actually play the whole game from the start again. Maybe
if they had some way of locking you out of certain driving assists
to have a different "difficulty" level, I would consider it. But
Gran Turismo 6.... probably :)

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/10/16/Game--Resonance-of-Fate--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Resonance of Fate (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">my wife got me Resonance of Fate for the PS3 for my birthday, but I
didn't start playing it until the beginning of August.

# Play details

I played it pretty much every day in August, when it was my main
game, but by the end of August, I was getting a bit tired of it. I
did every thing that was possible to do in the game as I played:
all the extra missions, challenge fights, and going to the Arena
occasionally. Eventually, the grind wore down on me quite a bit. I
stopped doing the challenge fights in chapter 10 and then in
chapter 12 I decided to stop doing the extra missions. This was
after 38.5 hours of playing the game. At that point, I rushed to
the end, but when I got to chapter 14, I couldn't get past the
first room of the story mission dungeon. I realized I wouldn't be
able to do, so I went back to my chapter 12 save and just played
for a very short time (about 1 battle or 1 mission) every day. It
took me until yesterday to get to the last dungeon and I decided
to push on through to the end of the game.

In the end, I played for 54 hours. Vashyron was level 76
(30+28+18), Zephyr was level 86 (27+35+24), and Leanne was level 3
(32+27+24). I definitely will not do all the Arena ranks or play
through the secret Neverland dungeon.

# Story

I found the story of the game to be really intriguing. The world
is very different than most games and I like the way that there
isn't a lot of exposition in the game. Instead, you are just
normal-ish people in the world and things gradually unfold. Most
cut-scenes are less than two minutes long it seems. Some cut
scenes are hilarious and some are really fascinating and
cool. However, after you get to level 10 or so and you realize
that the game must almost be over, it is really weird that it
seems like nothing really happened. It's just mild character
development. Even when the game was over, I said to myself, "What
even happened in this game?" I read the Wikipedia page about the
game and then all the dots connected. The story in the game is
intriguing and vague; the story in the Wikipedia page is
fascinating... I just wish it were in the game.

# Style

The characters and world exude "style". I love the dress-up
mini-game and I bought lots of different clothes until I found an
outfit for each character I really liked. I dressed Leanne with
black glasses, a black tight sweater, a pink knee-length skirt,
and tall white boots with a big bow on the laces so they looked
like  knee-ish high socks. I dressed Vash in jeans and a cool
white Resonance of Fate jacket. I dressed Zephyr in a dark
green-ish suit with a red undershirt.

The style really comes to a head in the battle system. It feels
exactly like a John Woo movie.

The Christmas segment... including the costumes... is insane.

I can't believe tri-Ace... which I think of as a very small
company... could make such a beautiful game.

# Mechanics

The most important part of a game to me is its mechanics. In RoF,
there are a few systems.

First, there's the world map. It is basically a board game where
you are unlocking pieces of the world with Tetris-like jigsaw
pieces you get from battles. You can only go places you unlock and
by unlocking places you gain other rewards such as items or
effects in battle. It is neat and totally unnecessary (for the
rest of the game to work), but I enjoy it, so it is a welcome
addition.

Second, there's the gun customization and item synthesize
systems. The game's combat is gun-based and you can customize your
guns with additional parts like barrels, scopes, magazines,
etc. There are like 5 attributes that you can enhance. I have no
idea what these attributes actually do, despite having played
through the whole game and spent a lot of time customizing. The
system works by laying out the extra parts in a 2D grid where they
must connect in appropriate ways (empty circle attaches to full
circle, empty square to full square, etc) to each other and
ultimately to the gun. It is fun to make ridiculous looking guns,
but I don't feel I really understood it enough to do it well. The
item synthesis is a corollary to this system because you can build
parts (and accessories, grenades, and bullets) with it. I don't
think I mastered (or needed to master) either system, but I did
use and have fun with them.

Third, there's the progression system. Each character has three
levels that are summed to get their total level. There's one level
per type of weapon---hand gun, machine gun, and thrown
weapon. Gaining levels gives you abilities when using that weapon,
like 10% damage increase, etc. I didn't focus each
character. Instead, I constantly rotated weapons around (you gain
levels in the weapons you use) to the weak character with that
weapon to boost their total level. Gaining total levels gives you
health and weight capacity (did I mention guns, accessories, and
their parts have weights?) I wonder if it would have been better
to focus each character.

Fourth, and biggest, there's the combat system. It is incredibly
complicated to explain, but very simple once you understand
it. The fundamental principle is that you can do a lot of blue
damage and very little red damage and only red damage kills
guys. However, if someone has 100 points of blue damage and you do
1 point of red damage, then the blue converts to red and you just
did 101 points of red damage. Everything in combat is about
filling up blue damage and then doing a little red
damage. However, there are many subtleties.

The most basic is that the angle you are firing at the enemy
matters and many enemies have shields that absorb fire from one
direction. The next is that blue damage recovers over time, so you
want to focus. The next is that you charge shots faster the closer
you are to the enemy. The next is that blue damage on you does not
turn into red damage, but instead when it fills up your whole life
gauge takes away 1 Hero point for every 1000 hit points. But
what's a hero point?

In this game, you can either stand still, charge and fire once, or
you can run past an enemy (jumping through the air and sliding on
the ground) and fire many times. When you make a run, you use a
Hero Point. You need to do this to make enough attacks. If you
ever run out of Hero Points, the next time your HP fills up blue,
you'll die, but you'll die anyways because you can't do these
runs. There's another subtlety though. If you run across the line
made by the other two characters, it gives you a Resonance Point,
which you can convert to one cycle of a tri-Attack where each
character makes a Hero Run to the point where the next character
is standing. During a tri-Attack, any enemy inside the triangle
cannot move or have their blue damage healed.

The trick to this system is that there is only one strategy: Have
each character make a hero run across the line of the other
characters such that they go really close to the enemy and end up
on the other side. Do this twice to set up a tri-Attack with a big
triangle. Then do it again. This technique wins every single
battle. The only thing you ever need to do in addition is
sometimes use grenades to cause area damage or wear the right
status-effect protection accessory.

In the beginning of the game (probably the first 20 hours), this
system feels really cool and neat every time. It is definitely fun
and original. However, after a while, you realize that it is just
like Sudoku. Every Sudoku board is the same because your strategy
is always the same. What you are doing is always the same. In
contrast, even though you can describe FF13 or Bayonetta in a
reductionist way---increase stress and then do damage OR do combos
and then do torture attacks----how you do that is different in
every situation. In RoF, it's the same. It doesn't exactly get
boring, but it loses its challenge.

The worst part, however, about the combat system is that it feels
a little too random sometimes. As mentioned before, there's just
one strategy I used. But I still often needed to make the attempt
to beat a boss three or four times in sequence before winning. The
only thing that separated one attempt from another were random
factors like causing a break, getting pushed a little bit by fire,
or getting a full scratch, or something. It doesn't seem right
that a random flip will make me go from utter defeat to utter
dominance. It seems like a random factor should make a small
difference, not a big one. This suggests to me that the game
really doesn't require much skill if I could never recover from
little flips like that.

A related problem is that it never feels like there is anything
you can do to make your characters better or more
powerful. Gaining levels, getting gun upgrades, etc don't seem to
make any difference on your play. I'm sure they do something but
it is so gradual they you never feel like you've reached a
new plateau where you can look down at where you were
and say you rock. There's nothing technically wrong with this, but
it doesn't give me the feeling I want.

# Summary

I was looking forward to this game because I've enjoyed every game
that tri-Ace has released that I've played. (I think I have missed
two games.) And when it was first coming out, I heard lots of fun
conversations about its crazy battle system. I wasn't let down by
the game, but I don't think this game will be as lasting to me as
Valkyrie Profile or Star Ocean 3 are. Overall, I recommend the
game. If you aren't super hardcore like me, maybe it would better
to have an easy mode, but I don't think one exists.

<div class="entry-content">A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I'll play it again unless I'm totally desperate. I'd rather
just read something on my phone. I don't blame this game though, I
think it's really the fault of the phone.

<div class="entry-content">I started on the July 12th and beat the main game on the 19th. I
continued playing the optional content until today. I did all the
extra "Search" missions, but I didn't want to invest the time to
do every other mission to unlock the /Final/ mission. (So I
watched it on YouTube.) In the end, I cleared 86 missions in
36:22:53.

I thought the game was amazing. It's beautiful and the controls
actually feel really nice (unlike Portable Ops, where the controls
were atrocious.) The story is really cool too. The main thing I
didn't like about the game is how a lot of the extra content
revolved around incredibly difficult boss fights. (It was about
half that and half stealth missions... which were all really
fun.)

I thought the pace of unlocking new content was really nice. A big
problem with some games like this is that you feel drowned in the
number of possible options. This has a nice slow drip that feels
rewarding to unlock more. Eventually though, it became too much
for me when there were so many combat missions on the docket.

There were many funny in-jokes in the Metal Gear Universe that I
enjoyed.

The biggest problem with the game though was the disgusting Che
worship. Ugh.

Highly recommended.

I have now played and beat every Metal Gear game that has been
released!

<div class="entry-content">I just beat Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.

I was really excited when the game was announced, because
Castlevania games are basically perfect in my eyes. I was also
excited that it would be multiplayer, because I wanted to have
my wife play with me.

Unfortunately, as more information about the game came out, I was
pretty disappointed. You can't play multiplayer in the same room
and it's just the combat sub-system of the game, with a lot of the
progression stripped out.

Nevertheless, I decided to get it and play it.

I played through the whole game with Alucard. I was originally
planning on playing through with all the characters, going through
the DLC characters and levels, etc... but after playing through
once I'm kind of non-plussed about doing that. I expect that it
will be more and more of the same with very little excitement.

While I won't play more of it, I did enjoy what I played. It is
very difficult to play by yourself, because there are very few
benefits to grinding and it isn't balanced for single player, but
it is very rewarding to conquer and master the boss patterns. In
particular, Death and Dracula each took me a few weeks to
beat. When I finally beat Dracula, I could only take one more hit
and I was in that state for a few minutes... miraculously dodging
everything. It was pretty rad.

I started the game in April and played about twice a week, then I
switched to playing every two days about two months ago.

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.

It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons---although there are some clear winners overall.

My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can't. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.

I'd recommend it, but I probably won't schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.

<div class="entry-content">I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.

It's a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.

I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.

I was playing as Xiphias and I'd never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC'd his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.

I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don't anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.

This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.

The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It's a blast to play. I'd like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)

I have three problems with the game.

First, the controllers aren't precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that's required.

Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.

Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.

But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.

<div class="entry-content">Late last year I got エスプガルーダII from someone on the SHMUPS
forum. I didn't start playing it every day until January, when I
stopped playing Mushi every day. My scores as of now are:
- ESPGaluda II - 360 Novice - Asagi: All-Clear. 217,480,251 points. #669 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Black Label Novice - Seseri: All-Clear. 229,344,460 points. #938 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Arrange - Tateha: Stage 2. 2,888,170 points. #1320 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - Omake! - Asagi: All-Clear. 496,851,202 points. #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Asagi: Stage 2. 1,615,157 points. #1675 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Ageha: Stage 3. 12,034,604 points. #771 #hiscore

I was able to easily 1CC the easy modes, but I've been working on
the normal modes for some time.

The art in the game is very pretty, but not as fantastical as
Mushi. Most of the enemies are human (they leave blood stains on
the ground, eww) or normal military-looking things, which I find
kind of boring. Nevertheless, the art, given the style, is
great.

The music on the first level is AMAZING, but the music for the
rest of the game is just so-so.

The scoring system is interesting. Basically, you get gems and
gold. Killing enemies drops gems. You can use gems to slow down
time. When you destroy an enemy and time is slowed, then all their
bullets become gold. (If you try to slow down time, but don't have
gems, time speeds up. If you kill enemies in this mode, they drop
gold. Also, you are always getting points just for being in this
mode.) Now, time is slower for the bullets, but not the
characters, so by slowing down time you build up many bullets on
the screen and you can cash them all in for gold if you picked a
good time (where good time means you can kill the enemy.) This is
a really neat risk/reward system because you can spend gems to
make it easier to dodge or to get high scores; and, getting high
scores means there needs to be many bullets, and you need to
accurately gauge if you can kill the enemy with the number of gems
you have, otherwise all those bullets will need to be dodged.

While it is very interesting, I don't find the game as enjoyable
as Mushi. It doesn't have the same pace or something. I've played
it every day for about six months and I think I will play it much
less frequently, and spend more time with Mushi.

<div class="entry-content">I've also been playing Decimation X3.

This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of
control insane. I love it.

The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.

Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it
regularly.

<div class="entry-content">Last night and tonight I played through Soldner X-2 on the
PS3.

I'd never really played a "Euroshmup" before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I'm not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)

The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.

close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn't use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.

<div class="entry-content">Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I'd heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.

I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven't
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won't play it
again.

I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.

I'm glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don't like it. It's too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.

<div class="entry-content">A few days ago I started playing Darksiders.

I was interested in the game because Vinny on the Giantbomb
cast was really into it and it sounded neat. I liked the idea of a
non-Nintendo Zelda game that focused a bit more on combat.

However, I didn't finish the game and I'm selling it because it
really didn't take me and I disliked it quite a bit.

On the first day, I was really struck by how bad the voice
acting was and how lame the story is. I think the core problem is
that it takes itself so incredibly seriously that it is so
laughable to hear gravely voices and faux "darkness". Another
thing I noticed was that, unlike Zelda, it does a poor job at
hiding its linearity. This was a little bit aggravating and made
the world feel a lot smaller than Hyrule. The biggest problem that
I noticed the first day, though, was how weak the brawler combat
was. It was a strange mixture between to easy (X X X X X B X X X Y
Y Y repeat) and to hard (the defense capabilities are almost
totally inadequate because of the input lag and weird hitboxes.)
Now, Zelda doesn't have very good combat either, but at least it
is a small part of the game. In contrast, Darksiders puts a lot of
emphasis on combat but doesn't have an adequate system. I think I
have been forever spoiled by Bayonetta.

On the second day, I continued to notice the combat and
actually began to think it was properly boring. The enemies take
way too long to kill and becomes pure tedium. I did one of the
first proper dungeons and was impressed with how big it was. But
when it wasn't clear that I hadn't finished and area and had to
backtrack A LOT, it was annoying. I ended that day at the first
big boss battle.

On the third day, I finished that boss battle. Man, that was
bad. The wild camera and huge hitboxes were maximally frustrating
and I almost considered stopping then, but I wanted to get through
the boss to ensure that I was uninterested in the game and not
just frustrated by a boss.  Well, I beat it and continued with the
quest. Here's a note I wrote: "This game is soooo tedious." There
is this weird genre-mixing segment shortly after that boss battle
that really didn't work.

I decided to sell the game after stopping for the night. I was
originally going to just use Amazon sales, but then I noticed I
could trade it in. Wow! Amazon Trade-In is cool!

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/07/Game--Vanquish--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Vanquish (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.

After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I'd never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.

I don't think I've ever really played a third-person
shooter. I've played third-person platform games with a little
shooting---like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I've
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I've certainly never played
anything in the modern "cover-based" shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.

I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very "real" and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.

I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a "squad" most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn't really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.

The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans---just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though---however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn't bothered
at all.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I'm an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.

There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there's a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards---as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.

The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the "cheap"
one-hit kills. For example, if you don't destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don't see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
"Unknown" enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack---over and
over. Yikes.

I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint---I
effectively "1cc'd" the game. Here are my stats:

Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77

I wish I could've kept track of the total time I played. (The
"Mission Time" is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.

While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don't feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played... nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.

Hoorah!

<div class="entry-content">The controls in this game are really strange after playing NSMBW
for so long. Also, it seems a lot easier than Mario in the
platforming, but less forgiving overall (Mario has bubbles,
plentitude of extra lives, etc.)

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/07/Game--Game-Dev-Story--iOS--2010--0/">Game: Game Dev Story (iOS, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Game Dev Story for iOS was on sale and I bought it. (The first
game I've ever bought for the iPhone for myself. (I bought my wife a
puzzle game.))

In this game, you simulate managing a video game company. You
hire staff (first 4, then 6, then 8) and pick what games you'll
make. You control the genre and theme of the game. There are a
wide variety of very funny combinations. (One of my most
successful games was a "Poncho" themed Action RPG.) You then
choose which of your staff will be in charge of the game, its
graphics, and sound. You can improve staff by leveling them up
with points or by training them. Training could be giving them
vacations, or sending them to college, or sending them to read
manga. (Trainings unlock more genres. For example, when you send a
coder on a long trip, they learn about the Poncho genre.) You can
advertise through a variety of means (I like Lunar Writing.) It's
really funny.

When I first started playing this game, it was super crack. It
is very satisfying to see the numbers go up and to hear the fire
noises and all that fun stuff. I like to see my profits and sales
go up, etc. However, the game gets pretty boring once you get all
the best staff and get into a rhythm. For me, that happen around
year 11 (there are 20 years in the game, each takes about 30
minutes I'd guess) when I hired all the "hackers" and started my
sequence of making a new game with high popularity and a good
combination, then a sequel, then back and forth. After that time,
every game was rated about 35 (out of 40) and I made millions. I
ended the game after making 67 games, selling 552,575,044 units,
and with $892,280.9K in the bank. My highest selling game was Dr
Bomboo with total sales of 31,708,001 units. Dr Bomboo was the
third in a series of robot-themed shooters. The name of my company
was "Get Bonus".

Overall, the game wasn't deep enough for its length, but the
first half was too much fun.

<div class="entry-content">Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.

This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and "flip" on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the "hardest"
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here's a video of someone else doing it:
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&feature=related).

Here are my end-game stats:

Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19

Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189

Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni

Here's another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.

I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it's easy to play.
