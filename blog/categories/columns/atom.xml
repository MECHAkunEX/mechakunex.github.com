    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've never played this puzzle game before. There's nothing too
wrong with it as a concept, but I find it very difficult to enjoy
puzzle games like this for a long time. They would really be best
as rotating little games in a larger context. This particular
version of the Columns concept, however, feels really broken.</p>

<p>As you get jewels, it gets faster and faster. It gets so fast that
you can't think at all and the best you can do it plan one move
ahead and then rotate the blocks as they've just landed to make
the most of the situation. It actually feels like you're not
really making decisions and are winning randomly.</p>

<p>I was able to make it 22 levels and there were many times I
basically gave up but randomly got triples that totally changed
my luck. Weird.</p>

<p>Total time: 0:15</p>
