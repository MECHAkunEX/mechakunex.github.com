    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had this game on my "Queue" since I bought it, but I've had
to admit to myself that I just hate playing games on the iPhone
so much, I'm definitely not going to sit down and play
this. Sometimes I play it when I'm waiting for something, but I
have other things that feel more productive that I could be doing
on my phone.</p>

<p>I like the game and I think it is the best iPhone game I've
played, but I really dislike the iPhone interface and this game
in particular feels like it would work just as well with
buttons. I feel like the only way for me to appreciate this game
will be for me to re-implement it myself and give it buttons.</p>

<p>So, I'm retiring it from my queue, with a bit of a sad face.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I play this a bit pretty much every time I got to the
bathroom. I'm stuck at a pretty standard score---I can get to the
first few red enemies. I still feel like the game's control would
be so much better with real buttons, etc. I've noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/">This interesting review</a> has some
observations I had too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like Tim Rogers and read a few reviews of this, so I got
it the week it came out. I played for about 5 minutes. So far it
is okay, but I feel like it be so much better with real buttons
and a D-pad. It is a very non-intuitive control scheme and clearly
contrived into what the iPhone can do. Ugh. I hate iPhone
games. I'll try it again, but at a first glance I appear to have
been duped again.</p>
