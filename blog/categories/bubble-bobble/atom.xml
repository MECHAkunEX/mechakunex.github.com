    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through Bubble Bobble on the NES. It took about four
days: the first three days I did about 30 levels each and then I
did the rest and the boss on the last day. I had my wife help me for
the boss, so I could get a good 2-player ending.</p>

<p>I love this game. I remember playing it sooo many times with my
brother as a kid. It's really great. I don't remember some of the
levels being so hard and I don't remember ever beating the boss,
although I get the impression that I did.</p>

<p>It felt very good to conquer this game. I highly recommend it to
everyone. I'm looking forward to playing it with the <em>REDACTED</em> and the
Peach when they are older.</p>
