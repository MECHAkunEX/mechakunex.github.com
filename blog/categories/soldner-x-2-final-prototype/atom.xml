    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night and tonight I played through Soldner X-2 on the
PS3.</p>

<p>I'd never really played a "Euroshmup" before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I'm not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)</p>

<p>The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.</p>
