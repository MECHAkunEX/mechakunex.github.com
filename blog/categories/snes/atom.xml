    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played SMB1 in this for a while because my son wanted to see
some Mario. When I died and needed to continue in the World 2
castle, my son suggested that we move on to a different game. He
really enjoyed the water level in world 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been telling my son the story of this game for a long time,
because he likes stories about dogs and exciting adventures by
boys. Today I suggested that he might like to see it. We played
for a bit. I forgot about how in the beginning you see the end of
the game and the various forms of the dog. Cool. We played
through to the bug boss of the pre-historic area, but I died. I
wasn't quick enough using items. I forgot that I wouldn't have a
checkpoint of some kind and we didn't save, but once. So, we
moved on to a different game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he'd be weak, but he wasn't), then we went to Sting
Chameleon's stage and got the Armor upgrade. I'm not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te----dious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played for about twenty minutes. We did the
Intro stage and then Chill Penguin. We got the dash and got to
the boss, but died on the first time and were out of lives. He
wanted to play Launch Octopus again so we did that had a tough
time with the ships before it was time for breakfast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We got through Ganon's tower today with 2 blue potions and 2
fairies. We lost the last fairy in the fight versus Agahnim, which
we entered with only three hearts. After that, I fought Ganon,
but failed to use a potion after using a fairy, then filled up
again and won. Woot!</p>
