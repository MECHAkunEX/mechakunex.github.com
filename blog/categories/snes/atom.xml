    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd never played this game before, but I thought it might be
interesting for my son because you don't need to do very much. He
wasn't interested in trying it and I did the first 5 races. It
was really neat. I'm excited about playing through it when it
comes up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son wanted to see an "easy" game and I thought this might be a
good choice because its input space is so limited. He didn't
really understand it and wanted to switch to something else after
I lost.</p>

himself. He spend 5 lives running directly into the first Goomba
and cracking up. He thought it was sooo funny.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played SMB1 in this for a while because my son wanted to see
some Mario. When I died and needed to continue in the World 2
castle, my son suggested that we move on to a different game. He
really enjoyed the water level in world 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been telling my son the story of this game for a long time,
because he likes stories about dogs and exciting adventures by
boys. Today I suggested that he might like to see it. We played
for a bit. I forgot about how in the beginning you see the end of
the game and the various forms of the dog. Cool. We played
through to the bug boss of the pre-historic area, but I died. I
wasn't quick enough using items. I forgot that I wouldn't have a
checkpoint of some kind and we didn't save, but once. So, we
moved on to a different game.</p>
