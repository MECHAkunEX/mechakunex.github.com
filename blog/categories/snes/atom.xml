    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half while we were watching a TV
show on my wife's laptop. It was relaxing to grind a bit. I got
to the port town and met the guy who knew Guy. The story is very
simple so far, but it's nice in a Dragon-Quest-y way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool "abilitease". I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I've
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn't realize it. But
now, it's quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It's cute so far though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn't get
passed the title screen... it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I showed this game to my son and got to block 3-2 on one
continue. I died once on Medusa, because I had been sloppy
earlier in the level and then the rest of the deaths came from
bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)</p>
