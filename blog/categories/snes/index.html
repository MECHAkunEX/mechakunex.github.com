<div class="entry-content">My son and I played this today; specifically SMB1. In the past he
has been able to get to the first pit, but rarely, because he is
still getting used to platforming. Today he did great and got to
it 5 times in row, but couldn't get past. It is interesting to
watch him play, because it makes you think about the game
differently. Avoiding a Goomba just requires jumping, because they
come to you. Getting over the pipes just requires jumping and
holding Right against it. But, a pit requires a little bit of a
run and jump at the right time.

  <h2>2010</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/26/Game--Final-Fantasy-4--SNES--1991--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 4 (SNES, 1991)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This month I played through Final Fantasy
IV on the Super Nintendo using the Japanese release and the J2e
translation.

I remember loving FF4 when I was younger, but I haven't played
it in a very long time. Back then, I remember hearing that the
Japanese version had more story scenes and a slightly different
story, due to the censorship Nintendo had at that point on the
SNES. Therefore, I was very excited to play a translation of the
Japanese version.

The new story is different in some subtle ways; the main change is
that there is a lot of risque humour, especially with Edge and
Palom. J2e kept "You Spoony Bard!", which was great to
remember. Most of the spells and items seemed to be named
differently, and something else I liked a lot was that there
seemed to be no limit put on item and character name lengths,
which made for some more pleasant reading.

Overall, FF4 is as good as I remember. The story is
entertaining and detailed enough, for the time. The battle system
is fun... and actually it is much more brutal than I
remembered. The non-boss battles were particularly rough rather
than the normal steam-rolling fodder. The optional content is very
detailed. The characters are interesting. A subtle thing I really
enjoy is that there is no character customization: by level 38,
Rosa always learns Reflect, with no options. This kind of thing is
no longer popular, but I liked the way it ties together the
character's personality and their battle powers. (For example,
when Rydia is encouraged by Rosa to cast a Fire spell---despite
her village being destroyed by fire---she then gains the ability
in combat as well.) Despite appearances, it actually gives you
more ability to be creative, because you have to find interesting
ways to use the abilities that you have, rather than find a boring
min-max strategy.

I misremembered the story a little bit, so I was pleasantly
surprised. For example, I thought that Edge would die near the end
and that FuSoYa would be in the party for the rest of the game,
but I was (obviously) wrong.

Definitely a great game, I think I will enjoy playing it again
in another few years.

<div class="entry-content">I've recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn't come with this game,
so I didn't play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I've gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.

I beat this game. I didn't get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn't do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser's Castle.

  <h2>2009</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2009/07/15/Game--Final-Fantasy-6--SNES--1994--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 6 (SNES, 1994)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-07-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played [Final Fantasy VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI) (GBA version) on the DS

I /loved/ this game when it first came out. I remember getting a
SNES for my birthday, but not having any games until Christmas
when I asked for /Final Fantasy III/ (as it was called in the
US... not that I knew that at the time.) When I finally got it, I
remember talking to a friend later on in the night about how I had
played all day and was already half way through.

I hadn't played the game in over ten years, but before then I
played it through many times. Well, this time it was just as
awesome. But rather than just gloat, I'll mention some things I
like about it:
- The characters have real depth and it matters who is in your
party in most situations as they react differently.
- The characters have unique battle personas for most of the game,
due to their useful special commands; although sadly this
degrades a little bit in the end game when magic is essential
for everything.
- The world is interesting with many connections that you don't
need to notice unless you care to look. For example, the woman
in love with the fallen soldier in Mobliz or Shadow's dreams in
the World of Ruin.
- The final battle is very unique with multiple parties and
different tiers with different status effect carry overs.
- [The Opera Scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M) (and portions of the [remake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGpIWD39Ngw) and a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NC45S948ss][live version
with the New Japan Philharmonic]]---definitely watch the live
version and after the original.)
- Speaking of that scene, the music is amazing.
- [Imp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCXGVNvtxkc)
- The multiple party dungeon system is neat, but see below.
- The split-up at the beginning of the game is very neat as well.

However, there are something I don't like (and unfortunately not
many games have got them right either):
- In the end game, it feels like any party is just as good as
another because of magic.
- The multiple party dungeons are tedious when characters aren't
equally leveled and the only way to get them there is to [grind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming)),
which sucks.
- Gau, Mog, Relm, and Strago's special commands are very cool when
you think about them but are very hard to use well. Gau in
particular requires [PhD to use well](http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/930370/50814).
- You can play the entire game and never see a [[http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Desperation_Attack][desperation
attack]]. (Before I read the FAQs, I had played the game three or
four times and only seen them twice.)

I didn't do Dragon's Den. I primarily used
Terra/Celes/Sabin/Mog->Umaro->Gogo
