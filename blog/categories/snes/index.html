<div class="entry-content">My son asked for this game today (rather than the next game in our
sequence, Mega Man 4.) So I played it for about an hour. I
couldn't beat any levels, but I fought Freeze Man and Cloud Man a
few times and got all the secret items on their stages. I think I
need to invest in Energy Tanks prior to a boss battle.

<div class="entry-content">I decided that I'm not going to continue playing this game. It's
definitely not a bad game, but it's also not an excellent
game. Given its age, there are really some interface things that
it should have done better:

- attacks should not go into empty space
- you should be able to see what equipment will improve your stats
and buy them easier
- you should be able to see what items do

Now, if I had a lot of nostalgia for this game, I would be much
more willing to play it to experience the story and world again,
but I have much more nostalgia for the second game. In terms of
story, this game basically does everything I think is cool in the
first few hours and then it's just been standard JRPG fare.

I do find the concept of the Old Cave with the "task" system to be
pretty interesting, but not enough to make me want to keep doing
it.

Basically this game will be left aside because of the "there's
not enough time in the world to play non-amazing games". I guess
this means that I can't really recommend the game either, because
there's things you should play instead, but it's still not a
"bad" game. For example, I prefer it to the PS3 Star Ocean or
some of the other modern junk I've tried to play.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours tonight. I got to the Old Cave and
to the Tower in the Northwest, but the enemies in the entry way
were pretty brutal. I feel like this game is almost all grind in
that way the DQ can be. There haven't really been any cute
moments in the story since the main character and Lufia don't
talk to each other anymore.

to the port town and met the guy who knew Guy. The story is very
simple so far, but it's nice in a Dragon-Quest-y way.

<div class="entry-content">We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool "abilitease". I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I've
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn't realize it. But
now, it's quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It's cute so far though.

<div class="entry-content">I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn't get
passed the title screen... it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.

bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)

<div class="entry-content">I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, "Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?" He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn't move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.

We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.

<div class="entry-content">My son and I played this today; specifically SMB1. In the past he
has been able to get to the first pit, but rarely, because he is
still getting used to platforming. Today he did great and got to
it 5 times in row, but couldn't get past. It is interesting to
watch him play, because it makes you think about the game
differently. Avoiding a Goomba just requires jumping, because they
come to you. Getting over the pipes just requires jumping and
holding Right against it. But, a pit requires a little bit of a
run and jump at the right time.

  <h2>2010</h2>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/26/Game--Final-Fantasy-4--SNES--1991--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 4 (SNES, 1991)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This month I played through Final Fantasy
IV on the Super Nintendo using the Japanese release and the J2e
translation.

I remember loving FF4 when I was younger, but I haven't played
it in a very long time. Back then, I remember hearing that the
Japanese version had more story scenes and a slightly different
story, due to the censorship Nintendo had at that point on the
SNES. Therefore, I was very excited to play a translation of the
Japanese version.

The new story is different in some subtle ways; the main change is
that there is a lot of risque humour, especially with Edge and
Palom. J2e kept "You Spoony Bard!", which was great to
remember. Most of the spells and items seemed to be named
differently, and something else I liked a lot was that there
seemed to be no limit put on item and character name lengths,
which made for some more pleasant reading.

Overall, FF4 is as good as I remember. The story is
entertaining and detailed enough, for the time. The battle system
is fun... and actually it is much more brutal than I
remembered. The non-boss battles were particularly rough rather
than the normal steam-rolling fodder. The optional content is very
detailed. The characters are interesting. A subtle thing I really
enjoy is that there is no character customization: by level 38,
Rosa always learns Reflect, with no options. This kind of thing is
no longer popular, but I liked the way it ties together the
character's personality and their battle powers. (For example,
when Rydia is encouraged by Rosa to cast a Fire spell---despite
her village being destroyed by fire---she then gains the ability
in combat as well.) Despite appearances, it actually gives you
more ability to be creative, because you have to find interesting
ways to use the abilities that you have, rather than find a boring
min-max strategy.

I misremembered the story a little bit, so I was pleasantly
surprised. For example, I thought that Edge would die near the end
and that FuSoYa would be in the party for the rest of the game,
but I was (obviously) wrong.

Definitely a great game, I think I will enjoy playing it again
in another few years.

<div class="entry-content">I've recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn't come with this game,
so I didn't play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I've gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.

I beat this game. I didn't get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn't do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser's Castle.

<time datetime="2009-07-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played [Final Fantasy VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI) (GBA version) on the DS

I /loved/ this game when it first came out. I remember getting a
SNES for my birthday, but not having any games until Christmas
when I asked for /Final Fantasy III/ (as it was called in the
US... not that I knew that at the time.) When I finally got it, I
remember talking to a friend later on in the night about how I had
played all day and was already half way through.

I hadn't played the game in over ten years, but before then I
played it through many times. Well, this time it was just as
awesome. But rather than just gloat, I'll mention some things I
like about it:
- The characters have real depth and it matters who is in your
party in most situations as they react differently.
- The characters have unique battle personas for most of the game,
due to their useful special commands; although sadly this
degrades a little bit in the end game when magic is essential
for everything.
- The world is interesting with many connections that you don't
need to notice unless you care to look. For example, the woman
in love with the fallen soldier in Mobliz or Shadow's dreams in
the World of Ruin.
- The final battle is very unique with multiple parties and
different tiers with different status effect carry overs.
- [The Opera Scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M) (and portions of the [remake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGpIWD39Ngw) and a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NC45S948ss][live version
with the New Japan Philharmonic]]---definitely watch the live
version and after the original.)
- Speaking of that scene, the music is amazing.
- [Imp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCXGVNvtxkc)
- The multiple party dungeon system is neat, but see below.
- The split-up at the beginning of the game is very neat as well.

However, there are something I don't like (and unfortunately not
many games have got them right either):
- In the end game, it feels like any party is just as good as
another because of magic.
- The multiple party dungeons are tedious when characters aren't
equally leveled and the only way to get them there is to [grind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming)),
which sucks.
- Gau, Mog, Relm, and Strago's special commands are very cool when
you think about them but are very hard to use well. Gau in
particular requires [PhD to use well](http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/930370/50814).
- You can play the entire game and never see a [[http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Desperation_Attack][desperation
attack]]. (Before I read the FAQs, I had played the game three or
four times and only seen them twice.)

I didn't do Dragon's Den. I primarily used
Terra/Celes/Sabin/Mog->Umaro->Gogo
