    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just played through Shoot 1UP, another game from Mommy's Best
Games. I also beat this in one sitting on the first try. Very
easy. The gimmick of this game is that you are controlling all
your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn't use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.</p>
