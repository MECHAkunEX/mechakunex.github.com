    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a much more traditional Bond movie, with a ridiculous and
large scale evil plot. I felt like the feel of the movie was a lot
different and that the beginning is much better and tighter than
the end. There are lots of bombshells in the movie, but they dwell
on Bond's ability to conquest a bit less.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun caper movie. The story is very complicated and has
lots of twists, in a way that reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven, but
with more off-the-wall occurrences. I feel like there were a lot
of things that should have been explained, because they would have
been very interesting, that weren't. For example, how Penelope
manages to get out of Prague. In general though, after about the
first third, the characters (which beforehand were fascinating)
all have their identities fixed and then they never change. We
learn a lot about Penelope in the beginning, but then she's
static. Similarly, the ending just doesn't feel right given what
we know about the character's feelings. Nevertheless, it was a
unique and cute movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn't really know anything about this movie before watching it,
but heard it was interesting. It was really cool. It was so
nostalgic of what life was like for me when I was young... going
to shows all night, etc. That was really cool about it.</p>
