    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Played Episode 41 Level 4 for almost an hour. Sometimes when I
play this game, I think to myself, "Wow, I hate this game's
controls so much." It is so frustrating that they never seem to
work right. Super Meat Boy has almost ruined every other
platformer for me. In fact, I'm so mad at the game right now, I am
demoting it from every two days to once a week.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My three year old loved this movie when he was two and it was on
Netflix. I think it is very cute and does a great job with the
visuals and in particular the expressiveness of the characters. I
think the kids act <em>just</em> like little kids. I don't like the plot
as much as other Miyazaki movies because almost nothing
happens. It's very meh. But it is still good because of how cool
the characters are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing Episode 39 for over an hour. The majority of
that time was spent on level 1. My eyes hurt and I can't play
anymore. I'm going to take a break. Currently I am at
level 4. Phew!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the levels in the game are just too absurd. For example,
Episode 39, level 1 has you do the same challenge over and over
again. The game just isn't very streamlined in the teaching
you. You feel like you know how to do something but are forced to
do it again, even though you aren't really dying and
restarting. Obviously I'll still be it, but it's very
annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a
time.</p>
