<div class="entry-content">I plan on starting this game today. I thought I'd write about my
expectations before I played it.

Like Blue Dragon, I'd heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It's one of the first "next gen" games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I've heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don't
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I've
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don't really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.

I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I'm skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.

Nevertheless, I'm pretty excited about seeing what it is like.

<div class="entry-content">Played Episode 41 Level 4 for almost an hour. Sometimes when I
play this game, I think to myself, "Wow, I hate this game's
controls so much." It is so frustrating that they never seem to
work right. Super Meat Boy has almost ruined every other
platformer for me. In fact, I'm so mad at the game right now, I am
demoting it from every two days to once a week.

<div class="entry-content">My three year old loved this movie when he was two and it was on
Netflix. I think it is very cute and does a great job with the
visuals and in particular the expressiveness of the characters. I
think the kids act *just* like little kids. I don't like the plot
as much as other Miyazaki movies because almost nothing
happens. It's very meh. But it is still good because of how cool
the characters are.

<div class="entry-content">Some of the levels in the game are just too absurd. For example,
Episode 39, level 1 has you do the same challenge over and over
again. The game just isn't very streamlined in the teaching
you. You feel like you know how to do something but are forced to
do it again, even though you aren't really dying and
restarting. Obviously I'll still be it, but it's very
annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a
time.

<div class="entry-content">I just had the worst experience playing this game ever. It lost my
progress from last time so I had to do a five level sequence over
again. It was unbearable. I noticed that this game has a much
worse UI than Meat Boy. For example, it is infuriating to have to
save every five levels and that it didn't work and that you need
to press A to revive and that you can't watch replays. Annoying!

<time datetime="2011-08-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don't think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.

As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn't have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.

It's competition, is, of course, Bayonetta---a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.

At it's core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it's very fair to compare them.

Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya's commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn't like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta's dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.

In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.

There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a "strong" attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can't, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.

One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it's really not that bad because it's so fast and you
basically can't fail.)

Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.

On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it "as a
camera" rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don't recall it ever happening.

But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn't have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.

The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.

The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.

This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.

I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don't remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.

I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.

By the way, here are my end-of-chapter statistics:

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/07/08/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid-4--PS3--2008--1/">Game: Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3, 2008) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-07-08T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)

First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard---the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no "Game Over if Spotted" mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.

After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:

Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP

You'll notice that I didn't make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I'm proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that's attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.

Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP

I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.

Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP

I think I bought a shotgun or something.

Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)

At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.

Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)

I used more continues in the final stage than any other.

One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.

In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn't grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn't hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn't get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)

In the story department, this game is a winner.

All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.

The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.

The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.

There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.

I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.

The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.

my wife's comment: People's butts in this game look weird.

In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone's toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.

The credits music is beautiful.

It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/31/Game--Lost-Odyssey--X360--2008--0/">Game: Lost Odyssey (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-31T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.

My completed game save reads: "43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50". During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.

As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.

The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
"Miss" appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of "time is frozen" style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.

The most amazing part of this game were the "Thousand Years of
Dreams" segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and "watch" these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those "dreams" are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby's cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim's character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim's loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here's what it said:

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey's "Thousand Years of Dreams" were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game's producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim's backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game's main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as "adding to the world's supply of<br/>senseless violence," he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being "shocked" at its pacifist message and "vivid<br/>imagery".</p></blockquote>

I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.

On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the "chocobo" music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.

The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven't played anything with better
looking environments.

There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying "mini-games": escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the "losing"
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.

The character models aren't very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good---especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that's
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It's really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to "perfect" male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming's body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)

On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.

On the subject of Ming's outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare [pictures of Ming](http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&biw=1050&bih=803) and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&biw=1050&bih=803&tbs=isch:1&sa=1&q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a "wispy" and "tendrily" style about them.

Another graphical thing: The "liquid" in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.

I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.

I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I'd ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn't run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn't look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.

Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details---like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.

In a word, I'd call the game "meaningful". There's a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.

One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn't be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren't really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat N+ for the DS.

Death stats in row-column order: 0, 37, 156, 443, 0, 110, 54, 2054
(bombs), 4 (clock), 4, 231, 134 (falling); Total: 3223.

Gold: 20323

This is an amazing 2D platforming game. It requires a lot of
precision and skill. I played it when I first got my DS, but
didn't spend a lot of time on it (in fact, I don't think I beat
the first episode.) But, I was reminded of it by Podcast 198x when
they compared it to Super Meat Boy, which I just got on XBLA. So,
since I'm DS-bound, I decided to play it.

I beat all the episodes and all the levels (I think there's
about 250.) The satisfaction I get from this game is shmup like:
you have an incredibly difficult challenge that you tackle bit by
bit---getting a little bit further in the level each time. It's a
great feeling to defeat something so difficult.

The game is incredibly exhilarating too. For example, there are
sentries that target you with their lasers and fire. You can see
the cross-hair starting to follow you and lock-on (it turns red
when it does); my heart races when I am avoiding laser
fire. Similarly, there are heat-seeking missiles that get on your
tail and it is a blast to avoid them.

The game is more physics-based than most platformers I've
played. A lot of levels require a certain amount of momentum to
get passed segments; gravity is actually acceleration rather than
velocity; etc. This makes an interesting challenge.

The game has perfect control. I can't think of anything that
could be better about it.

I think the only thing the game lacks is kickin music. I know
there was music, but it is totally forgetable.

Overall, amazing game: A+

Here's a video that gives a good taste of the game and one of the
hardest levels: [Episode 38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYVr3GpBIHM).

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/27/Game--Ikaruga--X360--2008--4/">Game: Ikaruga (X360, 2008) (5)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-06-27T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Since my last post about Ikaruga, I've continued my daily
training. I've made a few new accomplishments:
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.* I've been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.

Here's (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here's a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I've had a 12 chain
stretch and I'm on a 14 chain stretch. If I'm imbalanced because
I didn't have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I've been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I'll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it's time for the boss and I've got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.

I'm not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it's that important, but I'd like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.

- *Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.* This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn't say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I'm a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn't get hit once (which is good
because I didn't have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk)

I still love this game.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/22/Game--Soma-Bringer--DS--2008--0/">Game: Soma Bringer (DS, 2008)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five "acts" of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.

I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.

Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don't invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you'll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.

The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you'd want
to buy, so it just accumulates.

The story is interesting but there isn't anything too special
about it.

The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn't use it.

Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn't I quit.

<div class="entry-content">I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch---you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.

The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don't really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn't actually
feel like a shooting game.

This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.

<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Ikaruga back in August, I've *still* been playing
every day. I've played for 38 hours, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds
according to the game clock. I've recently made a nice
achievement, so I thought I would make a progress report.

My accomplishments to date:
- *Credit-feeding through the game on Easy, Normal, and Hard.*
This was the first thing I did by October. (It's not totally
brain-dead because you have to beat the bosses within the time
limit.) I was able to get through Easy before unlocking
free-play.
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 1.* I did this by the end of
November. It was really hard to get to that point, but now I get
an A without even thinking about it.
- *Easy - Chapter 1 - Dot Eater.* This only took a few tries and
was relatively easy. Done in November.
- *Easy - Chapter 2 - Dot Eater.* This was very hard, because it
requires pixel-perfect control to get through the blocks at the
beginning of the level. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIDc04e79M) But it
only took about two months, maybe a little less. Done in
December.
- *Easy - Chapter 3 - Dot Eater.* This was /very hard/. I've been
working on this since December, but I just did it tonight. For
comparison, there are over a thousand people who've done Chapter
1 - Dot Eater, 103 who've done Chapter 2, and only 44 who've
done Chapter 3. (FWIW, 24 for Chapter 4 and 25 for the Final
Chapter.) There are four main challenges to this: first, getting
through the moving block lasers that push you into obstacles,
then getting through rows of enemies and moving spears, then
getting chased by/dealing with Shigi, then dealing with the
spinning boss Uzura. Yikes. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5iefdDhvs)
- *Easy and Normal - One credit to Chapter 3's Boss.* Not much to
say here, except that doing these levels Dot Eater helps train
for the normal mode well.

<div class="entry-content">In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn't start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.

I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.

It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that's how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction "mysteries" are simply crazy
things you can't possible know until they come out of left
field. I'm glad this game wasn't like that.

I'm definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.

<div class="entry-content">Of the past two-ish months, I've played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It's kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.

It's a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It's quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don't get as many
lives/bombs during it.)

I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn't registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)

Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540

Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)
Extra =

<div class="entry-content">Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I'd played
it a few times about my brother-in-law's house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren't adjustable and the defaults don't work
as well on the stick. Bummer.

I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay... like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.

Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.

Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/09/Game--Fallout-3--X360--2008--0/">Game: Fallout 3 (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Over the past month I've been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I've ever played.

I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.

I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn't use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.

That's a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don't want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don't want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don't regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.

There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.

Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.

I don't think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/01/11/Game--Ikaruga--X360--2008--2/">Game: Ikaruga (X360, 2008) (3)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips...)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:

/metaphor/

The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:

"I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets."

Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against "The Power of the Gods"; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?

Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
"only" lasts 29 minutes, I've played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.

Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.

By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.

I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/17/Game--Castlevania--Order-of-Ecclesia--DS--2008--0/">Game: Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-17T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>17</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing this. Castlevania... how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:

The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She's beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn't fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she's wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she's absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.

The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated... I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.

The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits... some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That's something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and "makes sense". This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula's Castle it is huge.

The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.

The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.

The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don't
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game's combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn't really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops---like Arma Felix, so cool!)

I recommend this game, no reservations!

<div class="entry-content">I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can't believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.

The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I'm really impressed by
this game and can't wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.

There are some amazing videos of it online: [level 3 (perfect)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y) and
[1 player 2 player](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk). And [here's a description of the story](http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml).
