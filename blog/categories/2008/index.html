<div class="entry-content">I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn't have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they're just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.

Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.

[A great review](http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak).

<div class="entry-content">I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now... even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I'd like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I'm basically done with the game.

<div class="entry-content">I had to wait around for a long time today, so I played for about
40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn't use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn't use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I'll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.

break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.

<div class="entry-content">We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I've
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game... they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she'd be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said "until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die" instead of
"until death do you part"... thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.

enjoy the story in this Dragon Quest. It does a really good job of

<div class="entry-content">I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like "This Means War", in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don't think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely "hot" lady, although she's definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her "sexy" scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.

<div class="entry-content">The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.

I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.

I can't imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there's no doubt about
that, but I'm not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.

<div class="entry-content">I'm disappointed the movie didn't use the plot-point about the
"traitor" that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It's a cool
idea.

I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile... I can't imagine the audience really being excited about
it.

Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It's very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn't as touching.

<div class="entry-content">I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.

I find it very strange that if the Capitol is "surrounded" by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia... i.e. very far away... how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.

Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.

tough, but do-able and then near the middle to end it is insane,
but it's all the same rules. It's cool.

The story is totally absurd. But whatever. =)

<div class="entry-content">I went on a long flight, so I started a new DS game.

A few years ago I played through the first DS Advance Wars game
and found it really enjoyable, so I decided to go through the next
one.

I played for about 11 hours on the flight! I can't believe my
battery lasted that long---but I did stop because it was about to
die. Then I played for another 2-ish hours while waiting for the
next flight and then on it.

I got about chapter 21, which appears to be about 80 or 90%
through the game. I only did the challenge levels in the very
beginning, but stopped once they outstripped my patience and
focused on the campaign levels.

The game is pretty much exactly the same as the last one. I don't
remember having the anti-tank guns or the bikes in the last game,
but I could be wrong. There's no "dual strike" anymore, which is
good because it was always a pain to look at the top screen too.

The game is very interesting in a way, because there's no
progression system. Although you are gradually given new units and
abilities, you don't have any input on that process, it's all
story based. In essence, each level is about defeating the enemy
with the endownment you've been given. Very similar to my ideas
for rougelike RPGs.

I had a few ridiculous battles. For example, mission 10 took like
73 rounds with an incredible slow push into their territory and
many failed blitz attempts. I won 12 by depleting the enemy's last
unit's gas after their fighter killed my last plan and I had
defeated all their ground units honestly. Mission 14 took a ton of
attempts, probably four or five, and ended up going into 47
rounds. Mission 17 took a little over an hour to beat. (Basic math
tells me that each mission has taken on average about 40 minutes.)
It's interesting how much mileage the game provides.

The story is ridiculous just like the last game but in like the
totally opposite direction. The first game I played was very "Rah
rah" about world and treated it (in the story) like a silly game
with no consequences. This game is all about the evils of war and
of humanity in general with the main characters being pure divine
beings of goodness and everyone else being totally
detestable. It's pretty absurd. If there were voice-acting, it
would be the worst. The situation they are in is actually really
similar to Battlestar Galactica, but if all the bad guys on that
show were the ones in charge and the people at the edges were
trying to be good. I'm tempted to not even watch the story scenes
they are so ridiculous, but I'm doing it anyways.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn't load my Clear data, so I'm
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.

It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war... especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!

The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the "stealth" missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you'd make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)

I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don't think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I've got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it's mainly the story pushing me to do more.

It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren't counted
in the real total. Wow!

I highly recommend this game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the "Undodgeable

blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn't
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D'oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.

I can't believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia---he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.

<div class="entry-content">I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.

The story is getting really neat and touching. I can't believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to "avenge" her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she'll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&D area, so I suspect that it really isn't
that close to being done.

This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It's very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named "Ty the
Immortal"---I couldn't seem to land a killing hit on him... maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I'm sad I didn't get an A
on that fight.

I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
"fantastical" in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It's neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.

The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn't cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)---getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two---then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.

I'm using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.

I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can't do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.

I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.

- You can't reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can't decide that
you've made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.

- The game doesn't auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don't put enough Lancers, etc.

- The game doesn't give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don't see why
this is kept from me.

- The game doesn't do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.

So far I'm really like the story and the gameplay. It's a really
fun game!

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that'll be my
method... whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I'll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.

So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting... there's a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can't wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.

I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the "Imps", which I reckon means "Imperials." Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today. I went through one dungeon
and got to a really hard boss fight. I've been on a pattern of try
the boss then go back to the beginning of the dungeon fighting
dudes and back so I can gain some levels and try again. I think
I've had about 5 or 6 loops so far. It's pretty brutal too because
there's a medium difficulty boss battle before it that you have to
go through, so each failing boss fight takes about 10 minutes.

I've been talking with my wife about some of the stupid stuff in
this game. The biggest problem with it is the lack of agency in
almost every aspect of the game.

- Each unit has specific skills, like Smash II or Restore III, but
you don't get to choose what skills will actually be
used. Instead, you choose between a few "baskets" of
attacks. For example, you might have the option "*REDACTED*ge" which
has your five guys just do basic attacks and then you'll also
have "Attack 'em hard, man" which has two of your guys do two
seemingly random physical attacks. There's no option to just
determine what your units will do.

- It's not even possible for you to always choose each type of
basket. For example, generally there is a (1) no AP basket, (2)
physical AP basket, (3) magic AP basket, (4) healing AP basket,
and (5) hexing/buffing basket. Each one sometimes has a second
variant that uses much more AP. However, it's not the case that
on any given round you can choose between any of the baskets. I
have no idea what algorithm it is using to determine what I am
allowed to do. This is most frustrating with healing. Suppose I
have 2k HP and I'm fighting something that I know can do 1.2k
damage sometimes. If I get hit and get knocked down past 1.5k,
I'd like to heal as insurance for the eventually big one. Last
Remnant does not allow this. It only gives you the ability to
heal (and other teams to heal you) when you are really low, for
some unknown definition of really low. In this case, it's too
late. It is almost like the FF13 Paradigm system where all the
characters are AI controlled and you aren't allowed to switch to
any Paradigm whenever you want.

- Outside of combat, there's a similar lack of agency in the
character progression system. You have a whole bunch of
characters, but not one of them gives you the ability to decide
what skills they will learn as they progress. Rush (the main
character) can sometimes choose between two options after a
battle, but you don't really have any perspective on this
decision and it's very micro. Some of the leaders will ask you
whether to focus on physical or magical attacks, but
repercussions of this are pretty vague. You can't change the
equipment on your characters, except for the main one, but you
almost never need to do it (it seems) because there's rarely
anything better than what you have or will find in a dungeon in
a little bit.

Despite these big game play problems, I find the core idea pretty
interesting and it's tempting to keep playing and grind through it,
but I'm beginning to think it's just not worth given the many other
great games that are available.

I find the story to be pretty intriguing and original. The
production values are pretty bad in a lot of places and some of the
micro-story bits are pretty lame, but it's a reasonable package.

I feel real bad putting down games and not playing them to
completion, but I just can't get behind such flawed game play.

I was having a discussion with someone the other day about what
makes good game play and I stated three things:

- *Intuition*

The challenge of the game should require some inexplicable skill
that can't be feasibly turned into an algorithm by
humans. Tic-Tac-Toe is flawed in this way. A shmup is super easy
to imagine (algorithm: dodge bullets when they get close), but
it's basically impossible to succeed with such a system. Most
strategy and role-playing games can get too close to the edge of
easy to axiomatize. Games that /require/ memorization are some of
the worst offenders on this category by going in the opposite
direction from Tic-Tac-Toe; rather than having a deeply
algorithmic structure, they lack any coherence at all, so you
must resort to pure memorization. 

The Last Remnant is pretty good in this camp, I think, but the
place where the choice enters in is pretty weak---primarily in
what order your unions attack what enemy unions and to a lesser
extent how much AP you spend on any turn.

- *Fairness*

When you fail, it should be clear to you that it is your
fault. This doesn't mean you should know what to do to succeed,
but rather you should believe that you did something wrong. For
example, Super Mario Brothers is very good with this, except on
the ZX Spectrum, where the lack of scrolling forced you to do
blind jumps.

The Last Remnant is very bad on this category because it's lack
of player agency makes you always feel like it was the RNG that
killed you and not your lack of ability/planning/strategy/etc.

- *Precision*

A complement of Fairness is Precision, which means that you the
burden to communicate your intentions should be reasonable. Mario
is practically perfect here, because there is basically no delay
between your choice and the action and the set of actions (jump,
move, etc) is perfectly matched by the mechanism of choice (the
buttons on the controller.) Many games with complicated control
schemes violate the Precision principle. Many games have bad
input lag and other problems that stand in the way of
precision. Some games seem to violate Precision---like Street
Fighter, where we could imagine a 3DS style menu of the super
attacks, rather than the high-execution challenge abilities---but
some how do not, because the commands are tight and seem to flow
out of other actions you are doing anyways, and are coupled with
general tightness and precision. Sometimes a game consciously
makes the control harder as part of the challenge... DDR is
easier with four buttons that you can control with your fingers,
for example; but this is difficulty design decision to balance
and generally pushes the game from the abstract realm (the
screen) to the physical realm (dancing).

The Last Remnant's lack of Fairness almost entirely comes from
its lack of Precision. It is not possible for you to choose your
actions, so you know you should heal but the game prevents
you. It's not necessarily the case that lack of Precision leads
to lack of Fairness... the NES Castlevania games are very chunky
in their control, but somehow maintain Fairness.

So I guess I've decided to abandon The Last Remnant. I just read
the Wikipedia summary of the story and it sounds like it would
have been cool to experience, but it's not worth the suffering. I'm
glad I played it enough to feel like I really understand the
mechanics and gave them a chance, but I think my conscious will be
clear on abandoning the game.

<div class="entry-content">Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror's
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.

The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can't believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I'm glad I'd at least run into her
before.

<div class="entry-content">I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I'm in an area
now with just one person in my group and it's quite hard to go at

looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It's not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.

I'm finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven't
died since I restarted.

I made it through a bunch more areas (I'm about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don't know.) It's almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don't see
the global path so you don't get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.

When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn't find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
"side" quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places... kind
of a hole... that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.

<div class="entry-content">This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting... the concept of remnants is neat. They're basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.

In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I'm just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don't understand how to optimize it,
so I'm just getting by.

<div class="entry-content">Based on my last experience with the game, I think I'm basically
done with the game. I'm pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play---5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren't tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don't think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I'm doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn't quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can't remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn't noticed because I hadn't play SMB
yet.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/12/Game--The-Last-Remnant--X360--2008--1/">Game: The Last Remnant (X360, 2008) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-04-12T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>12</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved---I don't know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I've played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn't be able to bear doing it
all over again I don't think. At least not right away, I'll try
again tomorrow, I guess.

With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.

First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn't unbearable, but it was very noticeable.

Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad "dead
eye" syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren't great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.

Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I'm glad there isn't a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.

On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can't actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it's a strategy
game where positioning isn't directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.

On another level, it's kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select "Attack", "Magic", or "Item" and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey's) sometimes during them. Except that you don't
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don't actually choose
which skills you will use, like "Magic > Fire", you just choose
"Magic". Except that all your skills aren't always available, for
example, you can only choose "Heal" when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.

It is really strange.

Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven't
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles ("Press A to Win"-style). Tomorrow
I'll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.

<div class="entry-content">I plan on starting this game today. I thought I'd write about my
expectations before I played it.

Like Blue Dragon, I'd heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It's one of the first "next gen" games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I've heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don't
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I've
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don't really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.

I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I'm skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.

Nevertheless, I'm pretty excited about seeing what it is like.

do it again, even though you aren't really dying and

annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a

Wow, bad controls. So bad, I'm not actually interested in playing

Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?

<time datetime="2011-08-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don't think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.

As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn't have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.

It's competition, is, of course, Bayonetta---a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.

At it's core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it's very fair to compare them.

Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya's commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn't like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta's dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.

In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.

There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a "strong" attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can't, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.

One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it's really not that bad because it's so fast and you
basically can't fail.)

Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.

On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it "as a
camera" rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don't recall it ever happening.

But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn't have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.

The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.

The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.

This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.

I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don't remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.

I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.

By the way, here are my end-of-chapter statistics:

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/07/08/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid-4--PS3--2008--1/">Game: Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3, 2008) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-07-08T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)

First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard---the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no "Game Over if Spotted" mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.

After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:

Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP

You'll notice that I didn't make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I'm proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that's attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.

Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP

I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.

Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP

I think I bought a shotgun or something.

Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 64 (30 more)
Current Drebin Points: 153,021DP

At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.

Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 46 (15 more)
Alert Phases: 89 (8 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 81 (17 more)
Weapon Types Procured: 37
Flashbacks Watched: 214
Special Items Used: Not Used
Current Drebin Points: 332,947DP
Code Name: "Pigeon"
Other titles: Inchworm, Hyena, Pig, Leopard

I used more continues in the final stage than any other.

One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.

In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn't grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn't hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn't get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)

In the story department, this game is a winner.

All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.

The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.

The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.

There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.

I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.

The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.

my wife's comment: People's butts in this game look weird.

In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone's toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.

The credits music is beautiful.

It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/31/Game--Lost-Odyssey--X360--2008--0/">Game: Lost Odyssey (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-31T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.

My completed game save reads: "43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50". During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.

As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.

The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
"Miss" appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of "time is frozen" style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.

The most amazing part of this game were the "Thousand Years of
Dreams" segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and "watch" these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those "dreams" are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby's cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim's character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim's loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here's what it said:

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey's "Thousand Years of Dreams" were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game's producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim's backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game's main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as "adding to the world's supply of<br/>senseless violence," he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being "shocked" at its pacifist message and "vivid<br/>imagery".</p></blockquote>

I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.

On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the "chocobo" music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.

The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven't played anything with better
looking environments.

There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying "mini-games": escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the "losing"
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.

The character models aren't very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good---especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that's
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It's really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to "perfect" male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming's body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)

On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.

On the subject of Ming's outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare [pictures of Ming](http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&biw=1050&bih=803) and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&biw=1050&bih=803&tbs=isch:1&sa=1&q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a "wispy" and "tendrily" style about them.

Another graphical thing: The "liquid" in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.

I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.

I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I'd ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn't run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn't look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.

Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details---like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.

In a word, I'd call the game "meaningful". There's a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.

One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn't be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren't really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat N+ for the DS.

Death stats in row-column order: 0, 37, 156, 443, 0, 110, 54, 2054
(bombs), 4 (clock), 4, 231, 134 (falling); Total: 3223.

Gold: 20323

This is an amazing 2D platforming game. It requires a lot of
precision and skill. I played it when I first got my DS, but
didn't spend a lot of time on it (in fact, I don't think I beat
the first episode.) But, I was reminded of it by Podcast 198x when
they compared it to Super Meat Boy, which I just got on XBLA. So,
since I'm DS-bound, I decided to play it.

I beat all the episodes and all the levels (I think there's
about 250.) The satisfaction I get from this game is shmup like:
you have an incredibly difficult challenge that you tackle bit by
bit---getting a little bit further in the level each time. It's a
great feeling to defeat something so difficult.

The game is incredibly exhilarating too. For example, there are
sentries that target you with their lasers and fire. You can see
the cross-hair starting to follow you and lock-on (it turns red
when it does); my heart races when I am avoiding laser
fire. Similarly, there are heat-seeking missiles that get on your
tail and it is a blast to avoid them.

The game is more physics-based than most platformers I've
played. A lot of levels require a certain amount of momentum to
get passed segments; gravity is actually acceleration rather than
velocity; etc. This makes an interesting challenge.

The game has perfect control. I can't think of anything that
could be better about it.

I think the only thing the game lacks is kickin music. I know
there was music, but it is totally forgetable.

Overall, amazing game: A+

Here's a video that gives a good taste of the game and one of the
hardest levels: [Episode 38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYVr3GpBIHM).

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/27/Game--Ikaruga--X360--2008--4/">Game: Ikaruga (X360, 2008) (5)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-06-27T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Since my last post about Ikaruga, I've continued my daily
training. I've made a few new accomplishments:
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.* I've been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.

Here's (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here's a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I've had a 12 chain
stretch and I'm on a 14 chain stretch. If I'm imbalanced because
I didn't have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I've been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I'll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it's time for the boss and I've got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.

I'm not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it's that important, but I'd like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.

- *Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.* This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn't say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I'm a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn't get hit once (which is good
because I didn't have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk)

I still love this game.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/22/Game--Soma-Bringer--DS--2008--0/">Game: Soma Bringer (DS, 2008)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five "acts" of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.

I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.

Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don't invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you'll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.

The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you'd want
to buy, so it just accumulates.

The story is interesting but there isn't anything too special
about it.

The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn't use it.

Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn't I quit.

<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch---you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.

The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don't really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn't actually
feel like a shooting game.

This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.

<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Ikaruga back in August, I've *still* been playing
every day. I've played for 38 hours, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds
according to the game clock. I've recently made a nice
achievement, so I thought I would make a progress report.

My accomplishments to date:
- *Credit-feeding through the game on Easy, Normal, and Hard.*
This was the first thing I did by October. (It's not totally
brain-dead because you have to beat the bosses within the time
limit.) I was able to get through Easy before unlocking
free-play.
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 1.* I did this by the end of
November. It was really hard to get to that point, but now I get
an A without even thinking about it.
- *Easy - Chapter 1 - Dot Eater.* This only took a few tries and
was relatively easy. Done in November.
- *Easy - Chapter 2 - Dot Eater.* This was very hard, because it
requires pixel-perfect control to get through the blocks at the
beginning of the level. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIDc04e79M) But it
only took about two months, maybe a little less. Done in
December.
- *Easy - Chapter 3 - Dot Eater.* This was /very hard/. I've been
working on this since December, but I just did it tonight. For
comparison, there are over a thousand people who've done Chapter
1 - Dot Eater, 103 who've done Chapter 2, and only 44 who've
done Chapter 3. (FWIW, 24 for Chapter 4 and 25 for the Final
Chapter.) There are four main challenges to this: first, getting
through the moving block lasers that push you into obstacles,
then getting through rows of enemies and moving spears, then
getting chased by/dealing with Shigi, then dealing with the
spinning boss Uzura. Yikes. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5iefdDhvs)
- *Easy and Normal - One credit to Chapter 3's Boss.* Not much to
say here, except that doing these levels Dot Eater helps train
for the normal mode well.

<div class="entry-content">In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn't start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.

I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.

It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that's how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction "mysteries" are simply crazy
things you can't possible know until they come out of left
field. I'm glad this game wasn't like that.

I'm definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.

<div class="entry-content">Of the past two-ish months, I've played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It's kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.

It's a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It's quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don't get as many
lives/bombs during it.)

I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn't registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)

Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540

Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405

<div class="entry-content">Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I'd played
it a few times about my brother-in-law's house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren't adjustable and the defaults don't work
as well on the stick. Bummer.

I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay... like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.

Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.

Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def

<time datetime="2010-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Over the past month I've been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I've ever played.

I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.

I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn't use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.

That's a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don't want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don't want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don't regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.

There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.

Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.

I don't think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.

<div class="entry-content">I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips...)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:

/metaphor/

The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:

"I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets."

Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against "The Power of the Gods"; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?

Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
"only" lasts 29 minutes, I've played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.

Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.

By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.

I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/17/Game--Castlevania--Order-of-Ecclesia--DS--2008--0/">Game: Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-17T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>17</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing this. Castlevania... how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:

The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She's beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn't fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she's wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she's absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.

The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated... I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.

The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits... some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That's something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and "makes sense". This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula's Castle it is huge.

The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.

The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.

The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don't
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game's combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn't really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops---like Arma Felix, so cool!)

I recommend this game, no reservations!

<div class="entry-content">I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can't believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.

The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I'm really impressed by
this game and can't wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.

There are some amazing videos of it online: [level 3 (perfect)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y) and
[1 player 2 player](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk). And [here's a description of the story](http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml).
