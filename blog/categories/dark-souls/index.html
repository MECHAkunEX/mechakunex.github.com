<div class="entry-content">I played for like two hours today. I fought and won against
Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen's Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I'm supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.

<div class="entry-content">I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.

I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She's a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That's important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said "Amazing chest ahead". It's so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.

After failing utterly fighting her *and* realizing I hadn't
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn't buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.

I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn't
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.

So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I'd get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.) 

After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.

I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.

With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds---first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit *real* hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.

So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I'll have to
perfect it later.

TODO list:
- Explore the Blighttown - Swamp more
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I spent the time
working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I
would get repeatedly pummeled by the huge ghouls and then I kept
falling off and getting swarmed closer to the swamp. It was pretty
rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.

Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls... about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.

It's very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon's Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can't get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It's kind of frustrating.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn't recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn't skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.

I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.

I'm still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I'm getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That'll be nice to experiment with.

<div class="entry-content">I played today for a little over an hour. I got through the next
part of the Undead Parish. The Rhino was pretty tough and got me
once. Then I weaved my way around and accidentally stumbled into
the Bell Gargoyle fight. I died the first three times and then
accidentally died on the way. So I lost about 6k souls. Ouch. This
game is definitely great.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today and got used to the game. I
spent a long time planning my character based on remembering what
was a good strategy in Demon's Souls. I'll be taking the same
approach: really fast, huge shield, melee focus, but with a good
bow.

The tutorial phase of the game was much shorter and so far the
game seems incredibly linear, which I thought wasn't the case, but
maybe I'm just still in the beginning. Last time I took a very
linear approach through the game, but this time I intend to
explore a bit more.

The mechanics of the game are basically identical. The graphics
seem a little bit better... primarily in the lightning department,
but I don't know if I can really tell or I just have a bad
memory. It seems like this simply *is* Demon's Souls with a little
bit of a different structure---no hub, Humanity, etc.

That makes it sound like I don't like the idea of that, but I'm
actually very excited about playing it.

During my time tonight, I died twice. Each time against a boss on
my first fight with them. The game seems just as hard as before,
but I'm getting used to the controls again and learning how the
bosses behave. Overall, it's a pretty awesome game.

Here are my current stats (where ! indicates that the stat is at
the level I intend to leave it at for the foreseeable future):
