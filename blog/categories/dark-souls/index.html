<div class="entry-content">Tonight I played for a little less than three hours and finished
the game. I went through the Catacombs and then to the final
boss. I beat the Pinwheel boss and Nito on my first try. After I
got back to the Firelink Shrine, it took me a long time to figure
out that I just needed to jump down the pit to get back to the
Lordvessel. I did it the first time very nervously. I fought the
boss once and got creamed, then did a few of the upgrades I could
on my gear and then went back and beat him on my second try. After
I watched the ending, I had a big... that was it? Just explode
into the flame?

-- Review --

This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It's exactly like Demon's Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon's Souls.

I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could've been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren't a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.

The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I'm undead, there's a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don't really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon's Souls story was very
coherent.

The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it's all interconnected. It's very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly "level"-y.

I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon's. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don't
think it really evolved that much.

The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn't even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last... maybe I
just found a better farming spot.

The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon's, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don't really find the
game that difficult... just a good challenge... like Mega Man.

I'm a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon's. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks---about the same
amount of total days, I think.

Overall, I loved the game. But, I won't be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I'd really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.

<div class="entry-content">Today I played for a little less than four hours. I went from the
Duke's Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good... still hard because you've got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up...
it's all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow... just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.

I "love" seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.

<div class="entry-content">I spent some time grinding today (about an hour) and then got all
the Twinkling Shards I needed to fully upgrade my Giant armor and
the Giant's Hammer. It was pretty awesome once I did that. I then
fought the two bosses... I died the first time, but the second I
was more aggressive and got them down pretty quickly. After
getting the Lordvessel, I avenged the girl and advanced the
story. I feel like the end is in sight. I played for almost three
hours.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel's Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I'd
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn't kill him...). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave... which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain... and a major mistake to go down there. I think I'll
grind for souls and just buy them.

Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can't really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.

<div class="entry-content">I played for a little less than an hour tonight. I gained a level
by killing the gargoyle and then all the sentinels again---I
wanted to get all the chests... I forgot one. Then it took me a
while to figure out how to get to the chapel. I fought my way to
the fog gate, but then ran out of time for the night, so I walked
back. I wanted to do an epic jump, but misjudged the distance and
plummeted to my death. Nice.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours tonight. I explored the rest of
Sen's Fortress (or at least, I got to the boss) and then I
unlocked a shortcut to the boss, and then I tried to fight the
boss many many times. I could generally avoid almost every single
attack... occasionally I would get grabbed, but I could generally
heal myself. The main problem was that I kept getting knocked off
the tower by him. I probably fought him about 20 times. I explored
a number of different weapon options. Probably the best was
putting a Lightning enhancement on my Iaito, but I didn't have
enough to keep using it. Eventually I used the Drake Sword
(because Iaito's bleed didn't effect the Golem.) I won and it felt
real good. I explored the next area a tiny bit. I killed all the
Sentinels and got a level from that. I'm excited to be making
steady progress.

<div class="entry-content">I played for like two hours today. I fought and won against
Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen's Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I'm supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.

<div class="entry-content">I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.

I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She's a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That's important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said "Amazing chest ahead". It's so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.

After failing utterly fighting her *and* realizing I hadn't
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn't buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.

I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn't
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.

So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I'd get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.) 

After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.

I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.

With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds---first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit *real* hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.

So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I'll have to
perfect it later.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I spent the time
working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I
would get repeatedly pummeled by the huge ghouls and then I kept
falling off and getting swarmed closer to the swamp. It was pretty
rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.

Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls... about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.

It's very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon's Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can't get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It's kind of frustrating.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn't recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn't skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.

I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.

I'm still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I'm getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That'll be nice to experiment with.

<div class="entry-content">I played today for a little over an hour. I got through the next
part of the Undead Parish. The Rhino was pretty tough and got me
once. Then I weaved my way around and accidentally stumbled into
the Bell Gargoyle fight. I died the first three times and then
accidentally died on the way. So I lost about 6k souls. Ouch. This
game is definitely great.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today and got used to the game. I
spent a long time planning my character based on remembering what
was a good strategy in Demon's Souls. I'll be taking the same
approach: really fast, huge shield, melee focus, but with a good
bow.

The tutorial phase of the game was much shorter and so far the
game seems incredibly linear, which I thought wasn't the case, but
maybe I'm just still in the beginning. Last time I took a very
linear approach through the game, but this time I intend to
explore a bit more.

The mechanics of the game are basically identical. The graphics
seem a little bit better... primarily in the lightning department,
but I don't know if I can really tell or I just have a bad
memory. It seems like this simply *is* Demon's Souls with a little
bit of a different structure---no hub, Humanity, etc.

That makes it sound like I don't like the idea of that, but I'm
actually very excited about playing it.

During my time tonight, I died twice. Each time against a boss on
my first fight with them. The game seems just as hard as before,
but I'm getting used to the controls again and learning how the
bosses behave. Overall, it's a pretty awesome game.

Here are my current stats (where ! indicates that the stat is at
the level I intend to leave it at for the foreseeable future):
