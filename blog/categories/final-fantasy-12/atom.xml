    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a PS2 (after not having one for years) just to play
this. It was awesome.</p>

<p>What an amazing game. The story is very deep and compelling. The
characters really grow on you. It is perhaps the only instance of
good voice acting in a game that I can think of. The game play is
very fun and removes some of the annoying parts of most RPGs. The
music is great and either touching or exciting, whatever is
appropriate for the context. The graphics are beautiful,
particularly in the final boss battle. And then ending is truly
satisfying.</p>
