    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.</p>

<p>My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.</p>

<p>I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
"action", but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That's
what I like most about it... you feel like you are there and they
are real.</p>

<p>I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else's income and how public it is. I don't think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.</p>
