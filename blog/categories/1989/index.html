<div class="entry-content">I played three rounds and got to the boss of the first area both
times. This game is ridiculously bad. The controls are terrible
and basic mechanics are broken. For example, there's no period of
invulnerability when you get hit and you get stunlocked in
place. There were times when I missed a jump, landed on an enemy,
and slowly lost all my health as I couldn't move away.

I remember playing this game as a kid, but I don't remember every
getting past the first stage. I guess I never will.

<div class="entry-content">This is a really interesting game. It's clear to me how Resident
Evil was inspired by this. The difficulties of managing the
various members of the party and piecing together the
multi-dimensional fetch quest is a very interesting (and pretty
unique) structure for a game.

I played reading a walk-through that was very particular about
where you should go and what you should do. I feel like it would
be bad to play this way, because the whole point of the game is
to explore this world. However, it seems like it is pretty brutal
in terms of what your lack of knowledge means. I think I will put
this on my "revisit" pile.

Given my short time with the game, the main problem with it is
that it is just a puzzle and there's no good visceral feeling
associated with playing the game. The controls are pretty awkward
(knowing who is who is a pain in the beginning, but would
definitely get better as you played more) and the battle system is
uninteresting. The quick-time events are really fascinating. The
lack of an ability to see if a weapon is strong is
annoying. Overall, it's been a bit of an obtuse but really
strangely modern game. I feel like a game like this could be made
really well today. I don't think I can look past the flaws right
now though.

When I do play it again, I will have to re-rank it.

<time datetime="2012-11-24T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>24</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I'm fascinated by the existence of this game and I have been since
I heard that it existed. I played the game for about twenty
minutes in all Japanese. I was able to understand the menus, but I
didn't do much more than sound out the dialogue. The graphics are
ridiculously racist. The concept of the game is nuts and based on
my brief playing and a glance at a walkthrough... it is
transparent fetch quest with RPG battles in between. In some way,
this can be said of all RPGs, but it would be far too transparent
for me, given my limited grasp of the language. I wasn't able to
walk to the first fetch quest delivery point and back without
dying.

Grinding is really the worst thing for old RPGs. Many of them had
interesting mechanics, but were padded for their day. In more
modern times, this padding is really destructive if you want to
experience what was interesting about the game. There's no good
way to use codes and cheats to give a challenging, but still
non-tedious experience. There are ways to just pre-load with
super powers and get infinite experience, but that's little
better than just watching the game on YouTube.

As I get older I'm much more interested in games without
progression systems because from the second you start you're
faced with a test to learn new skills and apply them. The tests
get harder, but there's no artificial curve in the game. In other
games with internal progression systems, the progression is more
than just numeric... it requires more strategy and planning. For
example, Dragon Quest 1 is basically just about getting higher
numbers until you can get even higher numbers. There's little
strategy involved... just a test of how much risk you're willing
to take. In contrast, FF6 adds more party members, complicated
enemy patterns, many spells, etc as the game progresses.

I don't know where Tom Sawyer fits in this rubric, but I'm not
going to give it a chance. I have dipped into its existence and
found it very curious.

<div class="entry-content">I played this game (via the prototype ROM dump) for a bit
today. It's clear that this was the precursor to Earthbound. The
dialogue is great and the enemies are very odd.

It is also clear that it is a straight Dragon Quest clone. I was
not able to make it from the front door of my house to town
without dying. It took three trips before I reached a high enough
level to make it. When I got there, I had about $250 in cash, but
the next worthwhile weapon was $500. Classic. I started walking
around and was decimated by the first zombie on the way to the
cemetery (plot point #1).

During my short play, I noticed a few typos. This, combined with
the anticipatory pain of grinding, has led me to decide to replay
it on the Mother 1+2 remake for the GBA with the fan translation
that adds the "Easy Ring" option. I was definitely convinced that
I want to play this game, but not convinced by the NES version.

<div class="entry-content">I played this game for a bit. It's definitely better than the
last one. It seems a lot more deep and complex. It's got this
non-linear-ness to it which is interesting, but the controls are
still pretty sloppy. There were many times when I just couldn't
line up with an enemy and it was on top of me doing damage every
time it was possible. I'm still hopeful for the next sequel. But
this game doesn't do it for me.

<div class="entry-content">I played this for one run of about ten minutes. I got to 1-3. I
could very easily tell that this game was a novelty of its day:
Mario in Portable form! Today, there's no reason to play
this. It's not like it's bad... but the limitations of the Game
Boy are way too awkward to really enjoy it. There are some cool
things though, such as the rolling boulders and the different
enemy types, but there's no reason to play this when you're at
home (or even with the hand-held options that are available
today.)

<div class="entry-content">I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I've played
this many many times with other people... like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I've never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you're traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it's really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I'll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don't think it's strong enough to last on its own... but then
again, it's has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.

<div class="entry-content">I played today and gave it another chance. This time, it was a
total breeze. I did die in the Amazon after spending $300k, which
was really painful, but I realized that if you just hold bounce
next to the statue, guys come and die under you without a chance
of getting hurt. This was totally boring and stupid (it took
a few minutes), but it wasn't horrific. After that, there was no
more grinding. The whole game was really short... just about an
hour from start to finish. The best part was the unique challenge
of not being able to directly jump on enemies and the way you
sometimes needed to whack things with your cane. (For example,
the mummy ducks in the mansion where fun to fight when you had to
whack their ball & chain.) 

Overall, the game was fun... good music, cute monsters... and
it's classic in a certain sense, but I don't feel it is worth
replaying, because it is sooo easy.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/16/Game--Castlevania-3--NES--1989--5/">Game: Castlevania 3 (NES, 1989) (6)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-01-16T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">When I was in Japan, I bought a copy of Akumajou Densetsu for the
Famicom. I knew that it did not work on my PowerPak and I had
heard that due to its special chip the game was much much better
in the Japanese version. I got it very cheap too, so it was a nice
buy.

This is a great game. I find it much much more playable than the
other two NES Castlevania games. It is still quite clunky, but not
terribly obtuse compared to those games. I gave it a
play-through.

The first night I got the first level with a great deal of
frustration as I got used to the controls. The next night I went
through the clock tower and got Grant "DaNasty". The next night I
escaped from the clock tower, went through the next level, and
went through the pirate ship. The day I went through 4 and 5 and
then at night I went through 6, 7, and I got to the end of 8.

I played through stage 8 so many times I could get through it
perfectly without getting hit at all---up until the boss that
is. I could beat the first form of Death about a fifth of the
time, but I wasn't able to beat the second form. I probably fought
him about 30 or 40 times that night with no luck. So I decided to
use a password and skip to the next level.

However, in the next level I could barely even make it to the
second block. It got to the point where the screen is just
swarming with enemies that slowly suck your life away... and you
need to make it through 3 blocks and then fight
bosses. Insanity. It's too much for me and it's not rewarding
enough.

I do like the game and I will definitely play parts of it again,
but it got to an insane point that wasn't fun... just unfair.

<div class="entry-content">When I was young, I played Baseball Stars a lot with my friend
Jeff, so I remembered it as being a great baseball game.

When I just played it last night, I didn't really understand how
to play it. I suppose I should have read the manual, but it was
very non-intuitive and as I got a few innings in to the first game
and started to understand it better, I realized that I would have
liked it to be more RPG-like if I was going to play it alone. I
imagine that playing with another person would have been a good
experience, but by myself it really didn't catch me.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/10/Game--Clash-at-Demonhead--NES--1989--0/">Game: Clash at Demonhead (NES, 1989)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-01-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played Clash at Demonhead for about an hour last night.

This is a really interesting action platforming game. In my mind,
that genre is defined by Mega Man and Metroid if the combat is
projectile based. The thing that is particularly interesting about
it is that it uses a Metroidvania like structure where you have a
large world that you can repeatedly explore and go through. Unlike
Metroid where the gameplay is "uniform", Clash has different modes
where you choose paths on the world map and then do a platform
level. Almost like Mega Man where you choose bosses that are
otherwise disconnected.

As I said, I played for about an hour and in that time, I didn't
really catch the vision of the open world. Instead it just felt
really confusing and mish-mashed together. It makes me wonder if I
would feel Metroid was the same way if I played it totally
fresh.

Additionally, the action is good but not as good as Metroid or
Mega Man. So I've decided to put it down for a while and maybe I
will play it again so I can give it a better chance.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Blazing Lazers a few nights ago and tonight. This
is a shooter from 1989 on the PC Engine.

I found the weapons to be really cool. I particularly liked the
laser beam weapon that spread into weird shapes.

I found the hit box really annoying. The hit box is bigger than
the ship graphic and wider than it is vertically, so it is really
difficult to dodge properly, at least when compared to the modern
danmaku shooters I normally play.

I used save states before and after bosses, plus throughout the
final boss battle. In fact, my wife helped me restart a million
times through a particular explosion.

Overall, I thought the game was fun, but I like modern shooters
better. I didn't like it as much as the shooter that is in Retro
Game Challenge, which is supposedly based on this game.

<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I played Bonk's Adventure for the PC Engine (or
TurboGrafx-16.) The beginning of the game was very fun and
straight-forward, but once you get to the final level the
difficulty ramps up to an insane degree. It starts with a tunnel
in the water where there are spikes on the top and the bottom and
I have no idea how to get through without just spending multiple
lives to get through it. After that, there is a huge level full of
Mega Man-style disappearing blocks. Then there's basically a boss
rush where you face all the previous bosses then two final bosses,
which are both insane. Nevertheless, the game was fun, but crazy
at the end. I got 66,080 points. Word.
