    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another game that my son and I played today. He was very
fascinated by the different characters---especially the baby
wearing the frog costume. He didn't get the concept of aiming the
shooter, but he got that he was shooting out bubbles. For a while,
he would press the A button and I would aim, but then he'd get
bored and just smash it to cause a failure so he could pick a new
character. We primarily played it because he saw the Dreamcast
controller and wanted to try it.</p>
