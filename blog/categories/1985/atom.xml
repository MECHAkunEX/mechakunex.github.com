    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played Yie Ar Kung-Fu for my Famicom tonight. I got it when I
bought the Famicom and I read that it was one of the first
fighting games.</p>

<p>It's not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy's skull and it doesn't register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.</p>

<p>But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently played through Excitebike on the NES. I considered it
completed when I placed in the top three in each race.</p>

<p>I remember playing this a lot as a kid, although when I was young
I would mostly make tracks with tons and tons of jumps, rather
than actually playing the races. In fact, when I started to play
recently I didn't even know about the two different acceleration
buttons, although I quickly figured it out and did okay.</p>

<p>It's a pretty fun game, but I like modern racing games better. In
a lot of cases (i.e. sports games) I like the older, more abstract
games better, but in this case I think that it is a bit too
simplistic for my current tastes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past month I've been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn't remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she's been waiting a long time for me.</p>

<p>I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the
second quest.</p>
