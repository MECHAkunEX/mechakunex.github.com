    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been telling my son the story of this game for a long time,
because he likes stories about dogs and exciting adventures by
boys. Today I suggested that he might like to see it. We played
for a bit. I forgot about how in the beginning you see the end of
the game and the various forms of the dog. Cool. We played
through to the bug boss of the pre-historic area, but I died. I
wasn't quick enough using items. I forgot that I wouldn't have a
checkpoint of some kind and we didn't save, but once. So, we
moved on to a different game.</p>
