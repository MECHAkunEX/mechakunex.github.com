    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn't get
passed the title screen... it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been telling my son the story of this game for a long time,
because he likes stories about dogs and exciting adventures by
boys. Today I suggested that he might like to see it. We played
for a bit. I forgot about how in the beginning you see the end of
the game and the various forms of the dog. Cool. We played
through to the bug boss of the pre-historic area, but I died. I
wasn't quick enough using items. I forgot that I wouldn't have a
checkpoint of some kind and we didn't save, but once. So, we
moved on to a different game.</p>
