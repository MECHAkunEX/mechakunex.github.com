    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn't make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn't get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I'm doing terribly, but
it doesn't communicate to me in any way what I'm doing wrong. In
addition, I'm now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games... even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can't. Argh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this while my kids watched for like 40 minutes. We
played up to the Fork Lift one. I had a really hard time with it
and the See Saw. I really enjoyed the Double Date one, it was
super cute. The first Remix was fun too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this for the first time tonight and my wife got a medal
on her first try at "Hole in One" (although she did watch me be
terrible at it for about 5 minutes.) Very fun.</p>
