    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really fascinating episode. I liked how there were
some many subplots and little stories. I think the Moriarty
character is really cool, but I thought the actor wasn't a good
choice. I expected someone older and more menacing
looking. Instead, this guy looks like an angry bully
kid. Hopefully as we see him more, he'll look more the part.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a neat episode, although I think the details of the
crime was not as interesting. Watching Sherlock be Sherlock was
very fun and I thought the introduction of the Sara character
was cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch a new show and this was
recommended to us by some people. We watched it tonight on
Netflix. It was really awesome. Basically every scene was
amazing, clever, funny, etc. It had it all. I love that everyone
assumes they're a couple. It's cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I'm glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he'll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn't notice anything wrong with Allison's dancing. I'm
one of the "80% who don't know anything about ballet". It's kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it's all beautiful and can't notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family... she
don't seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>
