    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode was appalling! I can't believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew's distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They've laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I'm surprised
that in this episode they didn't show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.</p>

<p>The "rally girl" thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn't playing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch this show for a while, based on
the recommendation of her good friend. I can't think of that many
things that I care less about than football, so I've been
dragging my feet about watching it.</p>

<p>I found the first episode to be interesting. It is very
predictable in the plot development. The characters mostly play
to type, but they have a very real quality to them... like they
could be real people out there in a world that I know nothing
about (Texas, and Football.)</p>

<p>I really like the movie Varsity Blues and this is very
reminiscent of it. The small-town quaintness is cute and it is
interesting to learn about something I know nothing about.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed that no character in the show expressed
the idea that Jason's sacrifice was not worth it and that one
game or football itself is not worth ruining your life
over. Hopefully that will come up later.</p>

<p>I very much like the amount of faith in the show.</p>
