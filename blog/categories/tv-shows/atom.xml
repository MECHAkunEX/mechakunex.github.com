    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they're texting, there's
the six months she's pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she's actually dead, etc. It's a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson's girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he'd be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I'll be very annoyed that there won't be
any closure in the sixth episode.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really fascinating episode. I liked how there were
some many subplots and little stories. I think the Moriarty
character is really cool, but I thought the actor wasn't a good
choice. I expected someone older and more menacing
looking. Instead, this guy looks like an angry bully
kid. Hopefully as we see him more, he'll look more the part.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a neat episode, although I think the details of the
crime was not as interesting. Watching Sherlock be Sherlock was
very fun and I thought the introduction of the Sara character
was cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch a new show and this was
recommended to us by some people. We watched it tonight on
Netflix. It was really awesome. Basically every scene was
amazing, clever, funny, etc. It had it all. I love that everyone
assumes they're a couple. It's cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I'm glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he'll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.</p>
