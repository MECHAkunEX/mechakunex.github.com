    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've never watched a reality TV show, but I love ballet and

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an amazing episode. I love that it was so happy and so
many wonderful things happened. I feel like Daisy and Mary really
deserve their happiness. I like the way things happened with each
of them. The grandma was in ripe form this episode too. Classic.</p>
