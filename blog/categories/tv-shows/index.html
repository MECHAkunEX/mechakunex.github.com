<div class="entry-content">This was an awesome episode. Lots of very exciting things
happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT

opinion.

<div class="entry-content">This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.

<div class="entry-content">Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.

annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I'm proud of
Edith too, she's been very nice.

the house for more to do with the war. I like the way its about
almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I'm appalled by Edith cheating
with a farmer.

<div class="entry-content">I'm kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O'Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary's backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it's more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I'm still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I'm very curious
how the next season will go, because they've been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really intense episode. I really enjoyed the cuteness
between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years... at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.

<div class="entry-content">This episode was appalling! I can't believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?

<div class="entry-content">This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was

<div class="entry-content">We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I'm surprised
that in this episode they didn't show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.

The "rally girl" thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn't playing.

<div class="entry-content">My wife has been wanting to watch this show for a while, based on
the recommendation of her good friend. I can't think of that many
things that I care less about than football, so I've been
dragging my feet about watching it.

I found the first episode to be interesting. It is very
predictable in the plot development. The characters mostly play
to type, but they have a very real quality to them... like they
could be real people out there in a world that I know nothing
about (Texas, and Football.)

I really like the movie Varsity Blues and this is very
reminiscent of it. The small-town quaintness is cute and it is
interesting to learn about something I know nothing about.

I was very disappointed that no character in the show expressed
the idea that Jason's sacrifice was not worth it and that one
game or football itself is not worth ruining your life
over. Hopefully that will come up later.

I very much like the amount of faith in the show.

<div class="entry-content">This was a neat episode. It was basically just character
development for the Cylons, but it was very neat. I think the most
meaningful thing was about the disappointment of the One and his
role as a leader from the very beginning. Cool. There were no new
plot or mythology revelations, but it was neat.

<div class="entry-content">The flashbacks are interesting, but I wonder how they can
relevant. I don't feel like they answer big questions about the
characters, they just seem to be elaborating some of the
characters we already know about them. Even Gaius/Caprica and
Laura's things tell us new things about them, but we already
believed those characters traits. I'm kind of surprised that
Gaius would really go with Galactica and I still wonder what he
could do there. How will the story resolve what the deal is with
his "destiny" and his "angel"? I'm glad that Boomer is trying to
help Hera (even though she got her into the mess in the first
place.)  It was funny how the black guy said, "It looks like it
was wrong to trust her" and Cavil, ever the machine, says "No, it
was just a miscalculation." It was really cool to see the humans
fighting alongside Centurions (you wonder how they explained the
problem to them); and it was also neat to see the old Centurions
on the colony. I'm still not sure how they'll be able to fully
resolve the story. In my mind, they need (a) rescue Hera, (b)
destroy the Cylon threat, (c) find a place to live, and (d)
briefly explain how future integration will occur. Right now,
they are on track to (a) and I can imagine they'll be able to (b)
by destroying the colony, or something. But what'll happen with
(c) and (d)... or the other un-answered questions?

Well, the solution they came up with was pretty awesome. I find a
little hard to believe that they could convince everyone to put
down their technology, but it is a good solution. The connection
to real history is really cool too. It was super epic how Kara
came up with the jump coordinates and how she was really an angel
or something. Part of me wishes that they would go into more
detail with Gaius' cult, God, how the 13th (Cylon) colony was
attacked, etc, but another part of me thinks that they couldn't
do it in a non-absurd way. By the way, I found the truce from
Cavil to be very believable and I think he would have been
trustworthy. I didn't expect Tyril to be such a punk. What an
awesome show.

[Bryan Caplan](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/03/you_will_know_t.html) was very upset with the finale. He finds it really
unbelievable. I agree. But I think that the conclusion was safe,
in the sense that it resolved the core conflict in a meaningful
way. A few commentators make the point that it is the only way to
connect the Colonists with our past. One person on his site says
that the whole story is like a re-telling of the Flood: God is
sick of the wickness, so He destroys almost everyone and starts
over with a group of flawed people (Adama = Noah = weak to
drink). Another comment talks about how cool it would be if the
arrived in modern times and it dealt with how crazy we would feel
about them. The same guy says that they could have crash landed
to remove their equipment, rather than voluntary losing it. Re:
Kara leads people to their doom, might mean the destruction of
technology.

[*REDACTED* Matters](http://mormonmatters.org/2009/03/21/battlestar-galactica-series-finale-critique-spoiler-alert/) has an interesting review.

<div class="entry-content">This was a very interesting episode. I can't believe how terrible
Boomer is. Athena seems like she's in so much pain. I love the
little insight into Gaius' operation. There's now only one show
left, I have no idea how they can close it up. *REDACTED* thinks they
have to back and live on New Caprica, because that's the only
habitable place they know. Could Hera do something that will
drastically improve the situation from the Cylon Colony? What
will it be like when the Cylon Basestar is the military HQ? It's
intense.

<div class="entry-content">Wow, Boomer is a low down good fer nothin'. I totally predicted
that Kara's piano playing friend was her dad and that he wasn't
real. Given that he played that song, it makes me wonder if like
her dad was the only living "Daniel" Cylon---you know, the
artist. Because if he doesn't enter the plot in some way, why
would they tell us about him in the first place, given that it
wasn't really that informative about something else. (Maybe just
that Cavil is a punk.) Also, at the beginning of this episode I
was thinking about how Cavil has been missing most of the season,
at least since the hub was destroyed, and that he doesn't really
have plans that they are getting involved in. There's only two
episodes left!

<div class="entry-content">We didn't watch for as long as I hoped today... just one
episode. It was a really good episode though. I like the struggle
they are having about using support from the Cylons. I continue
to be fascinated by Gaius and what he is going to do. I love it
when he just says whatever Figment Six tells him to. I'm kind of
surprised what happened with Ellen. It seems even too low for
her. During this episode, I remembered something from the
Colonial Scriptures... it said that the 13th tribe was pursued by
demons. We were originally meant to assume that this was the
Cylons, but it appears that it was really not. I think it was
humans who later attacked them (as I said above.)

<div class="entry-content">This episode had a major plot dump. It was very interesting and
pretty consistent. I think my favourite part was how Helen
described how John set the Five up so that they would have "front
row seats" to his plans. It was also interesting to speculate on
the meaning of "this has all happened before"---particularly
given the implication that the 13th Tribe were Cylons and there
was a war on Kobol between AIs and Humans. They still haven't
explained who destroyed Earth when the Cylons were living
there. I speculate that it was a group of humans from Kobol who
had been searching for the Cylons for revenge and didn't go with
the 12 Colonies. I'm also fascinated by the idea that Galactica
is falling apart and will be improved by Cylons technology. And
I'm fascinated that Lee will reform the government. I can't
believe that the show can keep getting better and going in
different directions.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really great closing to the rebellion. I liked that
Gaius seemed to recognize the importance of his religious role. I
hope this will be a sign that he will take it more seriously, and
perhaps that it will signify the next plot arc in the show. It
was also interesting that Tory seemed to be in charge of the
Cylons, presumably because she is one of the Five, so they
respect her, and she embraces her Cylon nature. It is also
interesting that Tyrell basically saved the fleet. I hope that
Laura realizes it is basically her fault that this happened
because she refused her responsibilities as President. I was also
reminded in this episode that nothing really ever came of the
mutiny on the Demetrius. Strange.

<div class="entry-content">The Webisodes were kinda strange.

I knew it! The 13th tribe were totally Cylons! I wonder if Kara
is an Earthling, but there's a difference between Earth Cylons
and Earth Cylons who are part of the 12 Cylons... like they were
the ones who started the Colonial Cylon society but were a
relatively small part of the rest of the Cylons there. And
perhaps the 5 who left the 7 abandoned the original plan and went
to live with the humans casually. I think something like could
explain how Kara and Ellen could both be Cylon-like.

They really threw a wrench in my expectations for the
show... awesome!

<div class="entry-content">This was another really intense sequence of episodes. I thought
Lee becoming president was incredibly predictable. I can't
believe Sol was shacking up with Caprica Six... I can't believe
she was shacking with him; I hope she was using him for some
reason. The episode from the Cylon perspective was cool. I loved
Gaius talking to the Centurian. I still think it was horribly
wrong to destroy the resurrection hub. The revelation of who the
Four were, etc was really cool; especially how quickly Tory was
able to get over to the ship without people realizing. Getting to
Earth was super epic... having it be destroyed was also super
epic. As we were seeing Earth, *REDACTED* was like "What could they do
now?" Well, now we know.

I expect that the humanoid Cylons are really the 13th tribe, or
at least the creators/creations of them or something like that.

<div class="entry-content">This sequence of three episodes was really intense. The mutiny
aboard the Demetrius, Gaius' monotheism, the alliance with the
Cylons, it is all incredibly fascinating. Each episode is ending
of a severe cliff-hanger, particularly the third one in this
sequence, because they jump away. Crazy.

I can't believe Athena killed the Rebel Leader.

Although I was impressed by the Rebel Leader's speech to the
Quorum, I think it is wrong for the humans to take away their
resurrection ability. It is just as bad as what the Cylons did to
the humans. They need to be bigger and try to promote peace.

cool. Each of the new Cylons is having a little crisis as they
learn about themselves and how they should feel. I find Tory to
be most interesting, because she's fully converted to the
supremacy of Cylons (and the One True God, because of Gaius.)
Lee's character continues to be exemplary. I'm extremely
fascinated by Gaius. I loved how it looked like there was a
miracle going on when Figment Six was picking him up after he was
beat down. The thing with Caprica Six and the Colonel was super
weird though... I found Helen to look really disturbing in her
clothes for some reason... it just looked wrong.

on on Starbuck's ship. She has to find Earth, but how? How long
will they be gone? Second, I'm glad Lee is so honest and a
defender of freedom and justice; however, I think that we're
going to be told that his actions have ultimately bad
consequences because Laura is so good. Third, oh man, I can't
believe Kali would have killed herself, or was she trying to kill
her son? And then Tori (sp?) killed her? I get the impression
that she has really embraced her Cylon side and thinks the humans
are in the wrong in a lot of ways. (I noticed that she seemed to
have Cylon strength. I hope she'll free/connect with Caprica
Six.) And finally, it sucks what is going on with the good
Cylons. :(

amazed that the others don't see their hypocrisy. I was kind of

<div class="entry-content">This was an interesting episode about space racism. That plot
line was kind of cool, but I was hoping that there would be more
to the brief appearance we saw of Caprica Six.

On the subject of space racism, I think it is strange how whole
planets are casually stereotyped in the show. This is very common
thing in science fiction, but it really doesn't make sense. Given
how diverse opinions and culture are on our planet, it seems
strange to expect it to be any different. The only thing BSG has
on its side is that the planet were originally colonized by
(presumably) culturally homogenous "tribes" and thus could have
maintained their distinct (and cohesive) identities; although
that seems like a stretch given the length of time the colonies
existed.

Before this episode, I was thinking about the show and how
sketchy their information about the past, and in particular,
Kobol, is. It doesn't make sense that if their ancestors could
travel through space, they also wouldn't keep detailed records
that would give much more information. It's inconsistent.

<div class="entry-content">There were so many fascinating things in this episode. Anyone who
has seen it would agree. The things that are most interesting to
me are that they've consolidated the characters all back on
Galactica---Gaius, Caprica Six, Hera, etc. And it's very
surprising that they've totally killed off a Cylon model. It
seems a bit too transparent of a way to remove an actress. I have
a hard time believing the Cylons would really do it. Although I
suppose it's imaginable that in the longer run one model who take
control of all the others and make itself the only active one.

I think we are meant to think that Starbuck is one of the final
five or something because she's been greatly wronged by the
Cylons and apparently has had this vision. I'm disappointed that
Gaius didn't seem to learn anything from being in the temple.

<div class="entry-content">I really liked this episode. It was cool to have the Cylons and
the humans interact directly again. It was really cool to learn
more about the religion/history of the humans. It was very
surprising that Gaius and Caprica Six are on the splits. I'm
fascinated to find out what Gaius and Three are up to. I'm very
intrigued by what will happen with Athena. I feel like we are now
starting the arc that will go all the way to the end of the

they didn't draw it out and really destroy her character. I'm

<div class="entry-content">This was a really fascinating episode. I love learning about the
Cylons. The idea of projection, the taboo about the other five
Cylons, the idea of the hybrids, it is all very fascinating. It
is also incredible to imagine how the 13th tribe could have left
a booby trap for the Cylons. I hope that they go into that,
rather than just leaving it to be forgotten. I can't tell why
Gaius didn't share this information... he doesn't seem to be
using it against them in any way. The drama on Galactica was
neat, but drastically overshadowed by this other stuff.

<div class="entry-content">This was a great conclusion. The exodus was incredibly epic and
they did a good job preserving a lot of what was really great
from the space era of the show... like just having one ship, etc.

I'm not really that surprised that Starbuck's baby was a
fake... the facts just didn't add up. And in particular, at the
very beginning of the episode I thought to myself that she
couldn't be a half-Cylon because otherwise the Cylons would be
much less excited about Hera.

I'm glad that Gaius is okay... I presume he will be living with
the Cylons and Hera. I wonder what will happen to him.

Tigh's situation was pretty rough too. Too bad, but Helen was
very untrustworthy.

What an awesome show.

<div class="entry-content">I'm glad things worked out with the cliffhanger from the last
episode. I'm very curious about what's going on with the babies
and all that. I really have no confidence with if the rescue will
succeed. If it doesn't, then what is going to happen to the
fleet, just die? If it does, then they're back to what the show
was before without much exploration of what could have been
really interesting. It seems strange to end the New Caprica
sequence so quickly.

One thing I wondered during this episode was... what were the
Cylons originally for? Were they war robots? Did they do
everything... like normal jobs? What were the circumstances of
the original rebellion. Very curious.

because he's so defenseless and the only thing he can really do

whole situation with Starbuck is probably the most insane one
though. I'm glad that Sharon is trusted though. Jeepers.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really cool episode. In broad strokes, I was correct
about what the setup of the new show is. I was very happy with
the special touches that I would have never thought of. The most
exciting, probably being what is going on with Starbuck. But
overall, it was awesome. I can totally see this show remaining
amazing.

It is very interesting to see the show as an allegory about the
US relation to the Muslim world. Religious conflict. Overwhelming
force. Chasing down rebels. Trying to force our help on them even
if they don't want it. Etc. I'm sure it doesn't all work out, but
the first episode of this show with the hero being a suicide
bomber is pretty obvious point in that direction.

<div class="entry-content">This was an insane episode. They very quickly changed so many
fundamental things about the show.

The return of the survivors from Caprica was so quick, it seemed
far too easy and they didn't even dwell on how many people made
it, etc.

The draw down of the Cylons was amazing, but they didn't even
dwell on it and get the opinion of some of the people in the show
who would say something interesting---like Gaius or Figment
Number Six.

I was very proud of Lt. Gaida for turning in the XO and the
President and also proud of Adama for convincing her to step
down.

It was very powerful to see his reaction to the death of Pegasus
Number Six, as well as think about her feelings. Was she just
suicidal? Was it part of a plan?

The time leap to New Caprica City was also fascinating. I love
the idea of the military going back to the same waiting
anticipation that they were in so many years before, with
skeletal crews, etc. They do a good job showing how each person
had gotten sloppy in various ways or just otherwise changed their
lives.

Gaius becoming totally decadent seems perfectly in character. I
get the impression that he never saw Figment Six anymore.

Now, the bombshell at the end of the episode with the Cylons
coming back. That tops the cake of insanity.

It makes me wonder what the show could possibly become, because
it will be so different. Although I'll probably be wrong, I'll
give a prediction:

The Cylons came back because Caprica Six and Galactica Sharon
love their human partners and genuinely want to help repair the
damage they did to the humans by helping the relocate back to the
colonies and/or build up New Caprica. They know that they won't
be trusted, so they'll have to use the threat of force to get
them to help. Gaius will believe in this and fully cooperate, but
will be hated by the humans for this, despite greatly improving
their lives with Cylon workers. He'll be seen as even more in
their pocket by having bodyguards, etc.

At the same time, Starbuck will lead a resistance either in the
city or in the wilderness, while the fleet attacks from the
air. The former President will create a shadow government that
coordinates these activities and does ultimately self-destructive
actions.

Eventually word of the Cylon baby will escape, or Gaius will lead
some sort of large scale survey to track it down, if the Cylons
don't already have that plan. The baby will represent the further
dream of combining the two cultures peacefully.

This will go on for some time and then maybe some people will
leave for Earth again.

I'm excited.

<div class="entry-content">This was a truly amazing episode. I love learning more about the
Cylons and particularly about what Caprica Six (what I called her
too) and Galactica Sharon are up to. Although, I was expecting
them to run off with the human, now I realize it will be cooler
for them to work inside. I'm surprised that Gaius doesn't know
about what happened to the baby... I hope he will find out as
well as the actual mother. I think it is cool because they are
kind of setting it up so that Gaius and the Cylons on Caprica are
kind of the moral center of the show, since they effectively want
peace. When Gaius showed up to Number Six, *REDACTED* and I were like
"Whaaaaat?" as if he was a Cylon, but I think that him being in
her brain is actually more crazy. I guess we're to think it is
God?

immediately suspicious of the new admiral. The situation is
really crazy. This was one of the few times when we watched
another episode after one because the cliff-hanger was so
suspenseful.

how much the Cylons seem to care about the human myths.

have expected him to have disagreed more fundamentally with
him. His conversation about Boomer was also interesting. They are
doing a really interesting job trying to present the Cylons as
somewhat sympathetic characters... at least the Sharons. The
President's actions were fascinating as well, especially her
reluctant (but required) offering of blessings.

On Caprica, the concept of the Farm was horrific. I'm glad that
Starbuck is getting back. I thought it was neat that we've met a
new Cylon. Now it will be a big "dun-dun-daaa" moment when we see
another copy of him on the fleet and the people there won't know
what we do.

involving the Chief and the President.

I thought the Chief acted very wisely in trying to help out the
two girls, but also that he was noble in his obedience to
"soldier ethics" in regards to the Doctor's disagreement with the
Lt. I find the command structure of the military to be
fascinating---I don't want to be involved in it, but it's
great.

The President's little speech and revelation was pretty epic and
tough.

The XO is such a punk. I wonder how Adama will clean up his mess
once he wakes up. Tension.

stuff going on, this one opens with almost every bad thing

seem a bit too contrived... like Starbuck losing the raider. But
overall it created a lot of tension that the rest of the season
can resolve.

I like the further development of the backstory for some of the
characters.

I was really struck by how the marine wanted to pray and he
called the president the Gods' prophet.

I was very annoyed that Lee didn't immediately go investigate the
fallen Cylon ship, although maybe the next episode will open with
him doing exactly that.

the interrogation of the Cylon, because they are very interesting
characters. This was the first time I realized that it is a bit
unreasonable to only show Cylons we know of working together
(when they are by themselves) simply as a conceit to the fact
that viewers shouldn't know who the other ones are. The trope of
a "shadowy council" probably won't be as bad as this. I think it
is very interesting to speculate on the psyche and goals of the
Cylons, particularly with their psychological warfare like shown
in this episode. I was very intrigued by what would happen when
Gaius found out that Sharon was a Cylon... will he tell Adama
right away?

seemingly trivial things like that can be the "enemy" in this

is tragedy and I think one of the reasons is that I like it when
circumstances go as low as imaginable, but then people persevere
and are heroic. This episode had that in spades. I almost cried
at a few parts. I really enjoyed the joy at the new baby at the
end. The idea of the whiteboard where every human is tracked is
brilliant.

One thing I wonder about the world of the show is whether there
was a time when the Twelve Colonies did not know about each
other. Did they have a pre-radio technology era, or were they
colonized with advanced space technology and mostly stayed at
that complexity for a long time?

punishing the Humans for their sins. I thought it was awesome at
the end of the episode how they said they had to find and kill
the Humans or else they would come back some day for revenge.

I thought the revelations about the Human religion and the idea
of the mythic Earth is really cool. It makes you feel like they
could be out there somewhere. The *REDACTED* connection is great
too. I loved what they said the first verse of the Sacred Scrolls
were: "Life here came from out there". They know they are
colonists of somewhere, but don't know where.

It is a fascinating world. I think that's what I like about it.

<div class="entry-content">We watched the first episode of Battlestar Galactica last
night. Actually the first part of the miniseries.

My favourite part was how clearly they communicated that most
people had no idea what the Cylons were like and have no fear of
them, but that the old guys who do are the best qualified to deal
with them. I really liked the realization, as the war started,
that almost all the soldiers were too young to have even ever
seen a Cylon, but were now responsible to deal with them.

Very cool so far, I'm excited about the show.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/16/Lost-0/">Lost</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Starting in July, *REDACTED* and I started watching Lost. Since it had
finished, we were able to watch all the episodes with only the
delays we wanted, rather than having to wait in between
seasons---the way we like it.

My first experience with Lost was when I went to the graduate
school recruiting visit. Someone invited a few of us over to watch
the third or fourth episode. I wasn't really interested at the
time, but when I think of Lost, I think of that first. I'm guessing
I would've been caught if I had started back then. =)

I liked Lost because of the interesting mythology and the detailed
characters. Lost isn't really about the "plot" or about discovering
a "mystery", it is really a character drama where the situations in
the show just serve to illustrate the personalities of the
characters. Of course, this standard of the drama genre gets
co-opted by the mythology to turn the whole island experience into
a kind of test for the characters. The mythology as a whole is
really interesting and fun to speculate about. Yet I wouldn't say
that discovering it is really what the show is about, because I
don't believe the full mythology was in the mind of the creators,
thus you can't really call it a "mystery", but rather an unfolding
revelation.

My favourite characters where Juliette, Richard, Ben, and the
Monster. Of the survivors, I thought *REDACTED* was very well developed
and Sawyer showed the most growth, which is interesting. I liked
Annalucia and Boone, though they were short lived, so they are
harder to appreciate.

I'd definitely recommend Lost. I'm excited to read fan theories and
summaries now.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/07/Doll-House-0/">Doll House</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-05-07T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">About two weeks ago, *REDACTED* and I wanted to do something together
but didn't have a movie to watch, didn't want to play New Super
Mario Brothers Wii, didn't want to watch Seinfeld, and were feeling
lazy. So we decided to start watching a new Joss Whedon show,
Dollhouse. Naturally, we haven't done much at night since then
except watch it. Last night we finished the second season and thus
the whole series.

This show is amazing and awesome. It's very clever, in that Joss
way. The world is compelling and you feel like you understand it,
in that Joss way. The characters feel real, in that Joss way. There
is an epic story with twists and turns, in that Joss way. Everyone
needs to watch it. It helps suggests deep thoughts about free will,
love, desire, and technology that are fascinating and
important.

When I watched it, however, I realized one thing more than
anything else: /TV is Dead/.

I would /never/ watch live TV for any reason, other than General
Conference, even for a show as amazing as Dollhouse. If a show like
this can't get me to watch TV, and since it was cancelled the
feeling is common, then good TV simply can't exist anymore.

This is really sad, because easily my favourite creative person
in film/movies/etc is Joss Whedon and his forte is the arc and the
world that are only possible with TV serialization. That format
needs some other way of existing profitably. (DVD sales, etc can't
do it because they assume it has already aired.) I don't have any
ideas or advice, but I wish I did.

The looming cancellation of the show is incredibly present as
you watch it. It's totally true that the second season feels like
it is on "fast forward". There were many episodes where *REDACTED* and I
looked at each other and said, "That would be half a season if this
were Buffy", or similar comments. Yet, I'm glad the show had so
much closure and moved so far, especially after the annoying
non-ending of Firefly.
