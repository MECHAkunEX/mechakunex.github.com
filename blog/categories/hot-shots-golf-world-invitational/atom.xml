    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I used Amy exclusively and
beat the third challenge. I did really good on the third full
course tournament... until the 13th hole when I went from first to
last place by the end. Ouch.</p>

the third challenge again. I ran out of batteries before I could
finish though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about half an hour and did 3-5. I ended in 4th place
on Easy. The game is getting hard. I wonder if Pancho is just not
a good character because of his bad control?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today. I'm trying to beat the Pro VS
match. I tried first and the match lasted 15 minutes and I
ultimately lost after a good run of wins. I decided to try "Easy
Mode" to see how easy it was... and I lost twice and then won,
but failed on 3-5 twice. Easy doesn't really seem that much
easier and it's not worth having the green medal on the score
icon. I feel like I'm at a bit of a wall in this game and should
play it a lot less.</p>

<p>I'm going to schedule it for a weekly session on Sunday morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and half this morning. I got stars in every
beginner event. I did 1-5 as Chang and I beat Isabella in Sudden
Death on the third hole. It was very intense. Also, in 1-5 I got
a crown. I haven't figured out how to find out what will give you
a crown though. Everything seemed a lot easier with Change
because he had so much power, but it also seems like the
characters aren't really supposed to be better than one-another,
but just represent different play styles. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played all night while chatting and burping my
new baby. I got stars up to 3-4 and did the Pro VS match twice. In
the first one, I lost after just a few holes and in the second I
had her tied until the second to last hole, then lost by one
stroke in the last. Ouch. It's a very fun game. But I might be
playing too much :/</p>
