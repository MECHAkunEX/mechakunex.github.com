    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for about an hour and a half. I beat three of the
Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can't dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a "bullet" is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man's
stage. She killed a penguin! She's getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time... something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn't have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I beat Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Magnet
Man. I think it took three continues. The kids instigated it and I
think this time we'll actually play through the whole
game... gradually.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I beat Hard Man and Snake Man. Snake Man, and
his level, were excruciatingly hard. I found it very hard to
avoid Snake Man or do enough damage, but I lucked out with a good
pattern when I finally got him. I found the smoke stacks to be
the worst part of his level. A few times when the platform
appeared it launched me off into the abyss. Other times, the
bullets would hit me in mid-air, even if I killed them first
(because they'd respawn when I realigned so I wouldn't be pushed
off. It was very painful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kids and I played this for a bit today. We did Needle Man and
couldn't do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn't get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played through Snake Man's level, then started
Hard Man. He thought Snake Man was very cool. He said, at the
beginning of the level, "Is this Snake Man's body?" because it
looked like a Snake. He's very cute when he watches me play Mega
Man.</p>
