    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I used Amy exclusively and
beat the third challenge. I did really good on the third full
course tournament... until the 13th hole when I went from first to
last place by the end. Ouch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about twenty minutes. I bought Amy and tried to do
the third challenge again. I ran out of batteries before I could
finish though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about half an hour and did 3-5. I ended in 4th place
on Easy. The game is getting hard. I wonder if Pancho is just not
a good character because of his bad control?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today on one run. I got a very high
score. I don't know what it would mean to "beat" this game. In
addition, every time I play, even when I last longer, I don't
really feel like I did anything good since you can manage to get
back down to a blank screen so often. Another thing strange about
this game is that the difficulty never really changes, I just
feel like I keep going and going and going but the soundtrack
changes. It's odd.</p>

<p>I'm going to mark the game "Done" but play it whenever I need to
run down my Vita's battery.</p>
