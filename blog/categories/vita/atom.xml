    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I used Amy exclusively and
beat the third challenge. I did really good on the third full
course tournament... until the 13th hole when I went from first to
last place by the end. Ouch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about twenty minutes. I bought Amy and tried to do
the third challenge again. I ran out of batteries before I could
finish though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about half an hour and did 3-5. I ended in 4th place
on Easy. The game is getting hard. I wonder if Pancho is just not
a good character because of his bad control?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today on one run. I got a very high
score. I don't know what it would mean to "beat" this game. In
addition, every time I play, even when I last longer, I don't
really feel like I did anything good since you can manage to get
back down to a blank screen so often. Another thing strange about
this game is that the difficulty never really changes, I just
feel like I keep going and going and going but the soundtrack
changes. It's odd.</p>

<p>I'm going to mark the game "Done" but play it whenever I need to
run down my Vita's battery.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today. I'm trying to beat the Pro VS
match. I tried first and the match lasted 15 minutes and I
ultimately lost after a good run of wins. I decided to try "Easy
Mode" to see how easy it was... and I lost twice and then won,
but failed on 3-5 twice. Easy doesn't really seem that much
easier and it's not worth having the green medal on the score
icon. I feel like I'm at a bit of a wall in this game and should
play it a lot less.</p>

<p>I'm going to schedule it for a weekly session on Sunday morning.</p>
