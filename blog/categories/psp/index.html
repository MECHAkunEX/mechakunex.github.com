<time datetime="2011-08-01T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>01</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started on the July 12th and beat the main game on the 19th. I
continued playing the optional content until today. I did all the
extra "Search" missions, but I didn't want to invest the time to
do every other mission to unlock the /Final/ mission. (So I
watched it on YouTube.) In the end, I cleared 86 missions in
36:22:53.

I thought the game was amazing. It's beautiful and the controls
actually feel really nice (unlike Portable Ops, where the controls
were atrocious.) The story is really cool too. The main thing I
didn't like about the game is how a lot of the extra content
revolved around incredibly difficult boss fights. (It was about
half that and half stealth missions... which were all really
fun.)

I thought the pace of unlocking new content was really nice. A big
problem with some games like this is that you feel drowned in the
number of possible options. This has a nice slow drip that feels
rewarding to unlock more. Eventually though, it became too much
for me when there were so many combat missions on the docket.

There were many funny in-jokes in the Metal Gear Universe that I
enjoyed.

The biggest problem with the game though was the disgusting Che
worship. Ugh.

Highly recommended.

I have now played and beat every Metal Gear game that has been
released!

<div class="entry-content">Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.

I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.

In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.

The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.

The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don't feel
like it was a cop-out.

The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.

Great game!

<div class="entry-content">I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.

It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn't interested in doing more.

I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don't really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I've thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.

Another bad shmup for all the typical reasons. It is absurdly cute

This is a hori-shmup. I played it for about 30 minutes, but really

non-Treasure games: slippery controls, invisible bullets, and
weird hitboxes. I couldn't enjoy it.

<div class="entry-content">I watched the Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. It isn't a
game, but it is on the PSP. It's a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn't give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.

I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis' abilities to
the form, because you can't really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.

I'm interested in watching the second graphic novel.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/06/16/Game--Metal-Gear-Acid-2--PSP--2005--0/">Game: Metal Gear Acid 2 (PSP, 2005)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">After loving Metal Gear Acid so much, I played Metal Gear
Acid 2.

The opening movie of this was amazing.

The gameplay makes the last game feel like the first Dragon Quest:
there are so many ways the new interface is cleaner, easier, more
fluid, etc. I really like the improvements. The new gameplay
mechanics (like linkages and cover fire) where interesting, but
didn't really make it different. But I'm fine with that, because I
just wanted more game. (The blinding mechanic was definitely new,
but very annoying.)

The game gives you cards in a different order from the last game
and I generally felt the weapon power-level was higher initially,
although the support cards had the same path.

I really liked the cell-shaded style of the 3D graphics.

The game does an absurd jiggling animation with the female
characters. It is ridiculous.

This game seems even more combat focused than the last
game. Whereas in the last game, there were many traversal levels
where combat was the best approach, in this game there are many
straight-out combat missions. This game also feels like it has a
lot less time in between boss encounters. I also noticed that
there weren't really any "puzzle" levels, like before.

One thing that was close to a puzzle was the train level. It was
really cool to coax enemies into the path of the train and get
them squashed. Woo!

I did a little bit of grinding to get good cards, but I also made
some really stupid decks to get through some levels with a
challenge; both were fun.

The ending was very neat in its cinematic-ness, but the game in
general (and the bosses in particular) was a lot easier.

This game probably has more replay value because of the special
missions, but I didn't do any.

Here are my final stats:

Difficulty: Normal
Play Time: 14:24:20
Cost: 4395
Found: 45
Kills: 73
Total Damage: 15035
Clear Count: 1
Cards Collected: 41 (I don't know what this means... maybe in the stages?)

I hope there will be an Acid 3.

<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.

This game is utterly insane in concept. It is a turn-based
tactical game based on the Metal Gear world, with collectible card
game elements. You need to read the Wikipedia page's (linked
above) gameplay discussion to possibly understand how it
works. After playing it through, it is brilliant. I can't believe
how great it is.

I love the gameplay. It is so deep. The final battle is
particularly epic.

The art is beautiful. There is some great 2D art, in addition to
the cool 3D in the game, but the 2D is definitely a lot better.

The story and characters are great and really "fit" in the Metal
Gear universe, even though it is a gaiden.

One of my favourite things in retrospect was the opening movie
that was an "action" video, but using the card-mechanics of the
whole game, so it felt really awkward and off-kilter, but in an
endearing way.

I found that the stealth-gameplay was pretty weak and it was
really optimized for combat, but I think that's appropriate for
the gameplay since that's where it really shines.

I think it would have a lot of replay value, although I never
played any level again, although I definitely died a lot and had
to make many attempts on some levels. In all, the game took me
19:55:01 on Normal difficulty.

<div class="entry-content">I played Persona 3 again. This time I played a female character

social links with a walkthrough and got all the remaining Personas
(there were five more I needed.) I just played 30 minutes a day
and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies
except bosses, because my MC was soooo powerful. Overall, it
wasn't as good as the first time. I can't tell if it is because
I'd done it before, or because being a girl wasn't as exciting. I
can't really get excited about wooing boys. :) There are
definitely some good jokes if you know what happens to the guy.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I'd never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.

I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn't
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)

I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven't played a game for so long in a while.

I really liked the way understanding your enemy's weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would've preferred.

I played as the Male main character. I'd like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I'd also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it's fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC "Buffy
Summers". =)

I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.

I *highly* recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.

* Male MC: Aeon 8 / Fortune 5 / Temper. 5 / Priestess 1
