    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun anime movie. I like all the little subtle visual
jokes that they have and the general wackiness of the action. I
think you need to be a little bit older to appreciate it though, so
we didn't watch it with the kids.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren't totally showing, it gets a little real and that's
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second Kurosawa film that I've seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
"psychedelic" scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a pretty bad movie, but bad in that way that Pringles are,
where you think they are good while you're eating them, but every
so often you think "What am I doing?" and afterward as you reflect
on it, you regret. You should read the Wikipedia page on the
Critical Reception. I very much agree. There are a few funny
moments, but overall it feels so fake. The best part is how
realistic the tour members are. I direct tours, actually, and I
find a lot of it to be true to life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched this movie tonight. I heard a lot about it when it came
out, suggesting that it was a lame movie, but with some cool 3D
effects. Obviously I didn't watch it in 3D, but I found the normal
effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It's the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it's pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.</p>
