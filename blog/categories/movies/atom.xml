    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun horse movie. I feel like all horse movies are the
same, but they're the same and interesting. I was very impressed
by the horse after I read its Wikipedia page. I thought the
sub-plot of Penney being a "housewife" and having issues with her
family were interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really cute movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing. Taylor
Schilling is super beautiful. Zac was great in the movie, but I
think he looks too young for the part, even with
scruffiness. Something neat about Sparks is that his movies always
work, but as movies, there's nothing really special about
them. Interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn't
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn't (Craig's conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts' character was very cute,
although we don't learn anything about her, other than that she's
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don't really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wasn't sure what to think of this movie before seeing it, but
I'd heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very
bad for the guy... it must have been hard to grow up like that and
to be used to so badly your whole life...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad... my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>
