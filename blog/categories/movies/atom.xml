    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a crazy movie. It is very disturbing, but in a way that is
always beneath the surface in a hidden way. The double layered
fantasy world that the girls live in is terrible, but what's most
disturbing is that it is hiding a worse world. The fantasy within
that is really insane and feels very Japanese in its absurdity. I
liked that about it a lot. The visual effects and photography were
really interesting and different---particularly the beginning
sequence was crazy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a very cool movie. I didn't really have any expectations
for it and in the beginning (when Vitus is unhappy) I was
beginning to get really annoyed at the movie, but when it changes
and gets a new plot... man it's awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really cute movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing. Taylor
Schilling is super beautiful. Zac was great in the movie, but I
think he looks too young for the part, even with
scruffiness. Something neat about Sparks is that his movies always
work, but as movies, there's nothing really special about
them. Interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn't
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn't (Craig's conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts' character was very cute,
although we don't learn anything about her, other than that she's
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don't really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wasn't sure what to think of this movie before seeing it, but
I'd heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very
bad for the guy... it must have been hard to grow up like that and
to be used to so badly your whole life...</p>
