    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an interesting movie. I feel like the main point is that
we have two groups of people with loose morals, but vastly
different ways of reacting to them coming into conflict. The
characters are pretty complex and interesting. The environments,
food, clothes, and women all look very beautiful and elegant. It's
a fun non-stereotyped picture of France. I particularly like the
scene where the two police flirt. It serves no purpose other than
to say, "This can't happen in America."</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really neat movie. I didn't know anything about Coco
Chanel, besides who she was and that she had a major influence on
women's fashion. It was very interesting to learn about her life
before getting in to the fashion world. I like the subtlety of the
movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a fun movie. I'm on a <em>REDACTED</em> Ryan kick and I want to go read
all the novels. The story is really great and I love that the
engine really exists.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of my favourite movies. I love the early scenes of his
life as a boring analyst. Especially when his office mates are
talking about the intimate details of the lives of the people they
spy on. This is such a clever movie and it has so much great
acting. I greatly enjoy the disturbing way politics and personal
relationships get in the way of the right things happening. It's
deliciously cynical.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very touching movie. I would like to help these kids as
much as I can. I was most impressed that many people see all
<em>REDACTED</em>s as identical to these people, or at least as crazy.</p>
