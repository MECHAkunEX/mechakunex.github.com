<div class="entry-content">This is the second Kurosawa film that I've seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
"psychedelic" scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.

<div class="entry-content">This is a pretty bad movie, but bad in that way that Pringles are,
where you think they are good while you're eating them, but every
so often you think "What am I doing?" and afterward as you reflect
on it, you regret. You should read the Wikipedia page on the
Critical Reception. I very much agree. There are a few funny
moments, but overall it feels so fake. The best part is how
realistic the tour members are. I direct tours, actually, and I
find a lot of it to be true to life.

<div class="entry-content">We watched this movie tonight. I heard a lot about it when it came
out, suggesting that it was a lame movie, but with some cool 3D
effects. Obviously I didn't watch it in 3D, but I found the normal
effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It's the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it's pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.

<div class="entry-content">My three year old loved this movie when he was two and it was on
Netflix. I think it is very cute and does a great job with the
visuals and in particular the expressiveness of the characters. I
think the kids act *just* like little kids. I don't like the plot
as much as other Miyazaki movies because almost nothing
happens. It's very meh. But it is still good because of how cool
the characters are.

<div class="entry-content">I saw this on opening day, because my wife was going with some
friends and someone fell through, so I took the last ticket. I have
never read the books, so I don't really have opinions or
predilections about it. I thought the world was neat. They did a
good job showing the opulence of the people in the capitol, but I
don't think they really made the oppression disgusting enough. The
action was fun and she was pretty heroic---I found myself tearing
up a few times. I find the world to be pretty unbelievable
though. I don't understand how the people in the capitol could be
supportive of the oppression, when they don't seem to be kept in
the dark or otherwise "brainwashed" into thinking that they are
doing great things for the districts. Similarly, I don't understand
why they would not take better care of the districts or why the
districts would not have already gone on strike. The idea that this
could go on for 74 years strains credulity. I don't think Katniss
is a very consistent character. The movie communicated to me that
she was all about doing the right thing and would rather die than
not do that; yet, she doesn't do a whole lot against "the man". For
example, when she talks to Peter at night before the games start,
he says he wants to show that he is not "owned" and she agrees, but
says she'd like to go home. The way this scene plays out and how
she is so non-aggressive during the games said to me that she
really agreed with him. Yet, she never actually does anything to go
against them. Dying together at the end is a little bit like that,
but you get the impression that she knew they wouldn't let her do
it, and therefore it was an empty calculation rather than a
confident objection. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I
felt like it could be more. My wife says that it is part one of a
trilogy and my wishes will come true in some way in the
future. That's fine... but... it's annoying when you need to know
something about the real world to appreciate a movie... when it
can't satisfy you on its own.

<div class="entry-content">This an intense movie. It has a very surreal fighting choreography
style that is reminiscent of Crouching Tiger but much more
crazy. Each of the shinobi have very diverse and interesting
"arts". I love how the main characters seem like the wimps the
whole movie until they are finally forced to fight and they have
The Real Ultimate Power. It's very cool. The movie is also
incredibly sad and emotional; it is fittingly tragic for a Romeo &
Juliet-like story. I love the resolve of Oboro at the end. She's
super tough.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/03/20/Movie--Resident-Evil--Afterlife--starring-Milla-Jovovich--2010--0/">Movie: Resident Evil: Afterlife, starring Milla Jovovich (2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-03-20T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This movie is on par with the last one and perhaps a slight step
down. It is much less globe-trotting, with essentially four
sets---the Tokyo office (small), Alaska (small), the LA Prison
(large), and the Arcadia (small).

The opening fight is caraaaazy and has a lot of the elements of the
third movie where you think you're watching *the Alice* but
aren't. I was disappointed that Alice lost her powers almost
instantly, but I think it is probably good for the movie that she
lost them, because they make her too unstoppable... but it still
fun to have her as a super hero. They don't explain at all how she
recovers from the crash, separates from Wesker, doesn't reconnect
to her supplies / more clones in Nevada, etc. But whatever :)

The Claire pick-up is kind of strange at the time, but the
resolution of what she was doing is pretty awesome by the end of
the movie. It was a genuine surprise and I liked it a lot. By the
way, Ali Larter. Wow.

One of the worst things about this movie is how horrible the actor
who plays Wesker is. He's way to stiff and "too cool for school". I
can see what he was going for... by not moving very much he's
trying to act above the situation, but it comes across as really
stupid.

The ultimate action of the movie is strange because it is
practically a meaningless excursion---only Chris and Luther survive
and Luther barely does. It doesn't really do anything to advance
the mythos, just that Wesker is a tough guy and Umbrella continues
to experiment on people. I'd like them pursue that fact that really
only Umbrella has a chance of saving the world and if they weren't
such punks, Alice should be helping them. What does she expect to
do? She really has no motivation besides revenge and helping out
survivors (but mostly they just die because she's around.) I found
it interesting in the beginning that she clearly blames herself for
the outbreak. Is she referring to planning a robbery? Or being
involved in the first movie? It's unclear what she is talking
about.

The new kinds of zombies in this movie are interesting and appear
with almost no notice by the characters. The "Majini" zombies are
super creepy. The big "butcher" guy was weird; I expected him to be
like a rogue Nemesis, but they don't really go into at all.

The ending is pretty insane. First, Wikipedia says that a figure
parachutes away from the explosion of Wesker's plane, but I didn't
see that. (Just watched a video of that and it's pretty clear. When
I first saw the ending, I didn't realize what the smudge in the
background was, but now it is clear.) Weird. Second, every movie
ends with an opening for the next movie, but 2 and 3 end of very
happy resolutions. 1 is less happy, but still Alice is in a
position of control and power. This ending is a pretty bad
cliff-hanger because they are literally about to be blown
away. Where are all these Umbrella goons hiding? It was not at all
clear to me that the woman in command of the attack was Jill
Valentine, because she had different hair color. Weird. (I watched
the ending again and it still doesn't look like her, but the voice
sounds just like her.)

As I was watching, my PS3 detected a Cinavia watermark. What cool
technology! I had to switch to watching on the PC.

It is interesting that this movie made significantly more money
than the others. Good for them. The production value is definitely
up from the others. (Although I'd say that only the second was
"bad" on that front. The first wasn't good, but I think it was good
for its time.)

Regarding the Wikipedia summary of the reception: I agree that
there is a large amount of slow motion which seems incredibly
tedious---especially in Claire's fight in the shower. The action is
slower paced in general, but I think that is good, because you can
appreciate it more.

<div class="entry-content">This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It's basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn't really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We've gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine---again
there's basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it's fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the "domesticated" zombie acts. It's really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.

On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe... inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.

<time datetime="2012-03-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements--for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I'm glad they didn't kill any kids.)

There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to "Kill all
STARS" and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis' display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.

Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements---something that is actually kind of rare---I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel... a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.

Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.

I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.

Overall, I can't say I like this. [Roger Ebert's review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023) is funny;
"The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children."

beautiful and does a great job being tough, yet sensitive and
feminine. It's very funny and heart-warming. It has a nice romantic
sub-plot as well as being exciting and uplifting. It really just
made us happy when we watched it. I highly recommend it as a fun,
funny movie for a boring night!

<div class="entry-content">The wife and I watched this tonight. It's a very funny premise: a
world where no one can lie and the first instance thereof. They do
a good job world-building and making the setting seem real. I love
how all the waiters and waitresses say horrible things to the
guests. The religious sub-plot is much cooler than the romantic
sub-plot, and I think they could have/should have followed that
further---with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it's just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.

<div class="entry-content">I watched this because I listened to Retronauts and they talked
about it. I remember seeing it when it first came out and I enjoyed
it---as far as random action movies are enjoyable. The second time
around I continued enjoying it on that level. The CG effects are
pretty poorly integrated, but other than that it is really an on
par movie. I don't mind that the movie doesn't directly reference
anything in the game, because I think that it definitely feels like
it could be in the same universe. I enjoy that about it... it is
not stuck with decisions of the games and can do its own thing. On
the other hand, I read the original script by George Romero and
that it was pretty awesome and would have made a much better,
awesome movie.

<div class="entry-content">I really loved this movie. The plot is great. The story is very
subtle. For example, in an early scene George pressures Yukari into
a love hotel, seemingly to rape her, but I found it to be
incredibly clear that his real intentions were to force her to
stand up for herself by ensuring that inaction would lead to
something she definitely couldn't accept. It's got all the elements
of a great movie: fun, cute people, drama, love, beautiful
costumes, etc. At many times in the movie, I thought it was going
to go one way, but was wrong. For example, at one point their
consignment clothes are returned and they give up working together;
I assumed that Yukari---with her school skills---would create some
sort of advertising campaign and make their business work. Nope. I
like being surprised though. =) The music was also awesome.

<div class="entry-content">This is an awesome version of this story. The relationship between
Akari and Ryota is very cute and chaste. The story is incredibly
sad, but in a meaningful and moving way... not cheap at all :) It's
great. The special effects are pretty terrible, but there's really
only one sequence, so it doesn't distract. Riisa is beautiful.

<div class="entry-content">This was a neat movie. It reminds me a lot of Amelie---both in its
Frenchness and that there are slightly fantastical things going on
in an otherwise mundane plot. There was some pretty bad CG
work---the people on the platform in the opening sequence. The
characters were very funny and memorable. It was neat to learn
about Meilies---I read his Wikipedia page afterward. Nevertheless,
it seemed pretty shameless in its appeal to the Academy for awards:
it's a movie about how awesome movies are.

how Harvey Dent acts, it seems a little more un-natural watching it
the second time. I also remembered the scenes in Hong Kong being

<div class="entry-content">Kal No Naa Ho stars Sharhukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta.

Accidentally, I rented a bootleg DVD. So, it was blurry, and I
think some parts were cut, and the subtitles were not on the
songs.

Even with this bumble, I can say that the story was cute and the
characters were interesting. Unfortunately, most of the songs were
pretty bad. There were two towards the end (the first when Preity
falls in love; and some other) that were actually good though.

Recommendation: Decent, but bear through the first few songs and
get a good copy.

<div class="entry-content">Khushi stars Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Kapoor.

Story: The story was pretty cute and without some of the more
ridiculous things that happen in movies like this. The first five
minutes are particularly cheeseball though, so don't be turned off
right away.

*REDACTED*acters: The two characters are very lovable. And their
relationship is ultra-cute. Basically, they fight all the time
about little things... Kareena always mistakes what Fardeen means
and this is humourous. Kareena is also very difficult and gives
Fardeen pain in an amusing way. (I was very proud of myself when I
got what a surprised/confused/hurt face was about--Kareena made
Fardeen call her by the formal second person pronoun, /aap/,
rather than the informal, /tum/, that they used before a
fight. But I don't think I should be proud, a billion Indians would
have gotten it when they were six.)

Costumes: Kareena's outfits throughout the movie are great; not
/Devdas/ great, but good in a different way.

Songs: The first few songs were kind of bad and there's
basically a Pepsi ad in the middle of the movie; but, the later
songs are really good -- particularly the one when they dress up as
different people and after the hospital scene.

Overall: I thought it was good overall and can imagine renting it
again to show to someone.

<div class="entry-content">Devdas stars Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, and Aishwarya Rai.

I can't say much about the story, besides that it
/sounds/ very interesting from the DVD box blurb, but the
DVD I got did not have subtitles (and did not seem to be a bootleg
either.) However, the blurb was very detailed, so I was able to get
most of what was going on in the movie.

I really enjoyed the dancing and music, particular the song /Dola
Re Dola/ (chapter 17 on the DVD.) I cannot stress how amazing it
is. It motivated me to go read about the different styles of Indian
dance, whereupon I found [this article](http://www.meissoun.ch/dlai/dlai-bw-artikel-e.htm) that talks about the
different kinds in movies. It actually mentions that the dancing in
/Devdas/ is the Kathak style.

Recommendation: If you know Hindi, it's probably fabulous. If
you can find a DVD with subtitles, it's probably great. If not,
check out the songs. (And if I know you, I can show you the one
song I /really/ like.)

(More on the DVD: The DVD from Eros Entertainment is supposed to
be a special edition double-disc and is probably much better than
what I found, from the original producer.)

<div class="entry-content">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, from the team that created Kabhi Kushi Kabhie

Kajol, and Rani Mukherjee.

I thought the story, acting, and songs were great. Actually, the
songs were fabulous. I have a collection of CDs with songs from
Shahrukh movies, and I loved all the songs from this movie before I
saw it.

Shahrukh is handsome and well dressed in the movie, although he
reminds me a frog in general. Kajol was beautiful in the second
half and her wedding gowns were amazing. Rani was beautiful in the
beginning, although I think she looks better without her "modern
ideas."

<div class="entry-content">Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... is an incredibly adorable romantic comedy. It

Amitabh Bachchan. The songs were cute, but I was a bit let down by
the absence of traditional-style dances and costumes. The story was
great and I was on the edge of my seat, about to write the most
depressing LiveJournal entry ever, had the last plot twist not
happened.

Highly recommended, but different.

the story, but Amanda didn't think it was /that/ good.

A review on IMDB writes that it is an ``art-house movie
obviously not for commercial consumption.'' I can recommend it if
you don't expect a cutesy movie.

<div class="entry-content">Chameli is a much shorter Bollywood movie than is typical. It is
has a different style -- a couple that doesn't quite connect and is
made of a prostitute and businessman, but nothing like the cuteness
of /Pretty Woman/. The story is surprising, but Amanda didn't like
it very much, although I enjoyed it.

It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose.

A note on the songs -- the one Kareena dances is good, but most of
the others are not so good. But, the dancing in the club is great,
although a bit too provocative for my tastes.

mad very well, through his transition from being cutesy in love, to
crazy with pain.

how or if the couples would get together.

Preity Zinta was beautiful. Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna were very
good-looking.

Highly recommended.

The movie is a fairly clever. The biggest disappointment with it
