<div class="entry-content">Another stupid, crazy, spectacle movie. The plot is pretty
incomprehensible, but who cares, or expects better? The visuals
were really amazing. I was kind of annoyed that Megan Fox wasn't in
it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn't work for what they had the girl do, but I don't
see why that was a necessary plot point. Either way, the whole
movie was some good stupid fun.

<div class="entry-content">This is a very funny movie. It magnifies standard romantic comedy
cliches to a whole new level and is almost a "reductio ad absurdum"
of the concept of a "Baxter". I quite enjoyed it. Michelle Williams
was adorable in it, too.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/05/04/Movie--Underworld--Awakening--starring-Kate-Beckinsale--2012--0/">Movie: Underworld: Awakening, starring Kate Beckinsale (2012)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-05-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It's
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It's spectacular.

The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don't really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.

The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don't mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn't receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.

I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don't
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.

The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn't get
from the movie. For example, the daughter's name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.

<time datetime="2012-05-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Thinking about this movie the day after, there are some things
really strange about it:

All the movies more or less establish the vampires as basically in
the right, with the werewolves being too uncontrolled to be safe
for humans. Almost as if the vampires are protecting humans from
the immortals---especially given that they have a cultural
imperative to not consume human blood. (Viktor is a "bad" vampire
almost entirely because he sometimes breaks this rule.)

The first movie mixes this a little bit, portraying Lucian as
having been wronged and the vampires, especially Viktor, overly
prejudiced. But, it doesn't give Lucian any motives other than
revenge on vampires. Given that he is involved in offensive action,
it's not as if the vampires are simply out to get him. The war is
reciprocal.

The second movie really lays on the thick that danger of the
werewolves with the flash back sequences, but otherwise doesn't
really develop the reason for the conflict. It's basically just
sibling rivalry. (The movie is also weird because it makes very
little sense that Markus would act as he does now, as opposed to in
any of the previous 100 year periods where he was the sole reigning
vampire elder. It's especially incomprehensible why he destroys his
coven.)

The third movie doesn't really explain why Lucian would continue to
fight the vampires. It presents him as unassailably moral and a
freedom fighter. But once he gets his freedom, why does he have any
reason to continue fighting? Especially given that he thinks Viktor
is dead.

I presume that this won't be resolved or explained in the last
movie. But maybe not? It seems like Selene is the oldest vampire
that we've heard of it that is still alive and there has never been
any ranking werewolves other than Lucian and William.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/05/03/Movie--In-Time--starring-Justin-Timberlake--2011--0/">Movie: In Time, starring Justin Timberlake (2011)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-05-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This was a really fascinating movie. It's a totally unique dystopia
for me (maybe Wikipedia will tell me about things that are like
it?) and that is always fascinating. The plot is basically Bonnie &
Clyde after an initial glance at the prejudice and hardship in the
system.

The imagery is really cool and there are lots of interesting and
bizarre situations, like the way Wies introduces his female
relatives.

I think the movie lost some good opportunities for character
development. For example, Will gets 30 minutes for lunch at the
beginning but she dies by seconds when she can't take the bus, and
was just 20 minutes short of being able to pay for the bus
ride. Yet, he doesn't acknowledge this for the sake of the audience
or to show his great remorse, etc.

Overall, I found the movie to be very intriguing. This, however, is
also its biggest problem because it begs you to think about it
deeply and the world isn't explained well enough.

For example, there's a strong suggestion that the mantra "For few to
be immortal, many must die" has some sort of quasi-mystical and
dreadful significance. Like there is some sort of Big Brother type
that is keeping people down. However, this isn't followed through.

The purpose of the Time Keepers is not explained adequately. On one
level, they are simply cops and since money is time, they are
connected to time. However, in the end, when they're talking about
how "that much money can't leave that zone" and many other
situations, you get the impression that there is some deeper
purpose to their actions.

Similarly, the movie has poor economics. For example, what effect
does birth have, given that it introduces a year of time? If the
time is a real commodity---i.e. an abstraction of some sort of
energy their bodies need, rather than a fiat system (i.e. they are
like nanomachines that keep track of the time and just kill you
when it is zero.)---then where does the new year come from? How
could there be such price controls?

I think the movie could have resolved this better by coming up with
some sort of origin story and pseudo-science to explain why people
would choose to live like this (and everyone!) at some point
voluntarily and how it works. I think the fiat system would have
been interesting, because it makes it so there's actually a
solution that they could possibly reach. But, as it is, we can't
imagine that Will and Sylvia will ever actually fix
anything... other than what communists and Robin Hoods try to do
and fail to do in the real world.

The movie is very confused, therefore, with what its message (and
the message of its heroes) really is. Philippe spouts
pseudo-Capitalism, so perhaps the movie is anti-Capitalism? Yet,
the corruption of the Time Keepers vis a vis Fortis is reminiscent
of the relationship between the US and e.g. African dictators. So,
is it an anti "Globalization" or "Imperialist" politic?

I think because they don't foreshadow a solution or great evil
through technology or metaphysics, the world must be a "natural"
world and so the villain must be natural, and they rhetoric of the
movie leaves nothing left but a political agenda. Yet, it doesn't
articulate what the agenda is.

The movie is good for making it possible to think of it like this,
but it is bad because by not answering these questions, it is
incoherent and vapid.

<div class="entry-content">I was really surprised by the quality of this movie. I assumed that
because it didn't star Kate Beckinsale it would be a cheap version
of the world. But actually, I think it is the best yet; although it
wouldn't be very good without the first movie, obviously. It gives
a lot better context to the first movie and makes a lot of what
seems strange about the mythology a lot more reasonable. The story
is a lot more coherent and reasonable and the action is noticeably
slower, so you can appreciate it a bit more.

The development of the romance between Lucian and Sonja is totally
ignored, apart from a glance when they are kids.

Rhona Mitra really does look like Kate Beckinsale.

It's cool that the giant black werewolf from the first scene of the
first movie is one of Lucian's oldest friends. A nice little nod to
people paying attention.

<div class="entry-content">I thought that I hadn't seen this movie, but actually I have. Given
when it came out, I think I saw it in the theatres during grad
school. I would often go to the movie theater by myself on boring
nights/afternoons.

I think the production quality on the movie is significantly higher
and the fights are a lot more interesting. They did a good job
introducing new characters that were different. I like the
development of the mythology. Kate Beckinsale continues to look
amazing and she seems to be wearing a slightly different cat-suit.
The monsters look a little less like Buffy villains, but still a
little bit cheesy.

The plot feels a lot simpler, more like a roller-coaster ride where
the characters are chased from one place to the next without much
time for mystery or real plot development. It's a bit more of a
standard action movie in that regard, and I think it suffers
compared to the last for it. The cast of meaning characters is a
lot smaller with most (such as Corvinus and Tanis) really only have
one scene. The high point of the movie is probably the set of
flashbacks scenes.

<div class="entry-content">I forget why, but the other day I was reminded of this series. I
decided to start watching it, similar to how I went through the
Resident Evil movies. Like that series, I saw the first one when it
came out, but never saw the others. I remember thinking the movie
was cool and that Kate Beckinsale was amazing attractive.

On a second viewing, significantly older, I still think some parts
of the movie are cool. The mythology is interesting and fairly
developed. The actor of Viktor is pretty awesome; while the actor
that played Kraven was unbelievably bad. The character of Erica is
really interesting and subtle. And, yes, Kate Beckinsale is
woah---except, I don't understand the appeal of the "cat suits",
they make all her natural curves indistinguishable, like a running
bra or something. I don't get it, but I guess that had to because
this movie was made to be so Matrix-y. The action sequences are
very derivative of the Matrix and pretty boring overall
actually. Lots of akimbo and chunks of buildings flying off. The
best fight is probably the very first one. Even the final fight
between Viktor and Michael is pretty meh, because Michael is so
"whatever" that it doesn't get too exciting.

Definitely not a classic, but I'm interested in watching the rest
of them.

<div class="entry-content">This movie was really different than I thought it would be. I
expected that the end of the movie would be closer to ape dominance
and I expected that the character of Caesar would be more of a hero
for humans---kind of the only smart ape that loved humans, whereas
the other ones (like Koba) would just hate them. The movie was
pretty cool and Caesar was a great epic leader. There were lots of
really cool "A-hah!" moments of his progression that were super
satisfying. I'd like to see sequels to this made.

<div class="entry-content">This was a big budget popcorn summer movie, but a pretty good one
of that category. It starts off, and sounds like, it will be just
like all the other movies, with practically the same setup; but it
quickly acknowledges that and goes in a different direction. They
didn't over use the faces, like they've done before, and they there
was only one real bad scene of Tom Cruise fawning over himself. I
think my major disappointments were its lack of a romantic sub-plot
and the lack of real consequences to not being able to use IMF
resources---even though they explicitly mention how that is
standing in their way at a few points, they solve the problem too
easily.

had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren't totally showing, it gets a little real and that's
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.

effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It's the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it's pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.

<div class="entry-content">My three year old loved this movie when he was two and it was on
Netflix. I think it is very cute and does a great job with the
visuals and in particular the expressiveness of the characters. I
think the kids act *just* like little kids. I don't like the plot
as much as other Miyazaki movies because almost nothing
happens. It's very meh. But it is still good because of how cool
the characters are.

<div class="entry-content">I saw this on opening day, because my wife was going with some
friends and someone fell through, so I took the last ticket. I have
never read the books, so I don't really have opinions or
predilections about it. I thought the world was neat. They did a
good job showing the opulence of the people in the capitol, but I
don't think they really made the oppression disgusting enough. The
action was fun and she was pretty heroic---I found myself tearing
up a few times. I find the world to be pretty unbelievable
though. I don't understand how the people in the capitol could be
supportive of the oppression, when they don't seem to be kept in
the dark or otherwise "brainwashed" into thinking that they are
doing great things for the districts. Similarly, I don't understand
why they would not take better care of the districts or why the
districts would not have already gone on strike. The idea that this
could go on for 74 years strains credulity. I don't think Katniss
is a very consistent character. The movie communicated to me that
she was all about doing the right thing and would rather die than
not do that; yet, she doesn't do a whole lot against "the man". For
example, when she talks to Peter at night before the games start,
he says he wants to show that he is not "owned" and she agrees, but
says she'd like to go home. The way this scene plays out and how
she is so non-aggressive during the games said to me that she
really agreed with him. Yet, she never actually does anything to go
against them. Dying together at the end is a little bit like that,
but you get the impression that she knew they wouldn't let her do
it, and therefore it was an empty calculation rather than a
confident objection. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I
felt like it could be more. My wife says that it is part one of a
trilogy and my wishes will come true in some way in the
future. That's fine... but... it's annoying when you need to know
something about the real world to appreciate a movie... when it
can't satisfy you on its own.

<div class="entry-content">This an intense movie. It has a very surreal fighting choreography
style that is reminiscent of Crouching Tiger but much more
crazy. Each of the shinobi have very diverse and interesting
"arts". I love how the main characters seem like the wimps the
whole movie until they are finally forced to fight and they have
The Real Ultimate Power. It's very cool. The movie is also
incredibly sad and emotional; it is fittingly tragic for a Romeo &
Juliet-like story. I love the resolve of Oboro at the end. She's
super tough.

<time datetime="2012-03-20T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This movie is on par with the last one and perhaps a slight step
down. It is much less globe-trotting, with essentially four
sets---the Tokyo office (small), Alaska (small), the LA Prison
(large), and the Arcadia (small).

The opening fight is caraaaazy and has a lot of the elements of the
third movie where you think you're watching *the Alice* but
aren't. I was disappointed that Alice lost her powers almost
instantly, but I think it is probably good for the movie that she
lost them, because they make her too unstoppable... but it still
fun to have her as a super hero. They don't explain at all how she
recovers from the crash, separates from Wesker, doesn't reconnect
to her supplies / more clones in Nevada, etc. But whatever :)

The Claire pick-up is kind of strange at the time, but the
resolution of what she was doing is pretty awesome by the end of
the movie. It was a genuine surprise and I liked it a lot. By the
way, Ali Larter. Wow.

One of the worst things about this movie is how horrible the actor
who plays Wesker is. He's way to stiff and "too cool for school". I
can see what he was going for... by not moving very much he's
trying to act above the situation, but it comes across as really
stupid.

The ultimate action of the movie is strange because it is
practically a meaningless excursion---only Chris and Luther survive
and Luther barely does. It doesn't really do anything to advance
the mythos, just that Wesker is a tough guy and Umbrella continues
to experiment on people. I'd like them pursue that fact that really
only Umbrella has a chance of saving the world and if they weren't
such punks, Alice should be helping them. What does she expect to
do? She really has no motivation besides revenge and helping out
survivors (but mostly they just die because she's around.) I found
it interesting in the beginning that she clearly blames herself for
the outbreak. Is she referring to planning a robbery? Or being
involved in the first movie? It's unclear what she is talking
about.

The new kinds of zombies in this movie are interesting and appear
with almost no notice by the characters. The "Majini" zombies are
super creepy. The big "butcher" guy was weird; I expected him to be
like a rogue Nemesis, but they don't really go into at all.

The ending is pretty insane. First, Wikipedia says that a figure
parachutes away from the explosion of Wesker's plane, but I didn't
see that. (Just watched a video of that and it's pretty clear. When
I first saw the ending, I didn't realize what the smudge in the
background was, but now it is clear.) Weird. Second, every movie
ends with an opening for the next movie, but 2 and 3 end of very
happy resolutions. 1 is less happy, but still Alice is in a
position of control and power. This ending is a pretty bad
cliff-hanger because they are literally about to be blown
away. Where are all these Umbrella goons hiding? It was not at all
clear to me that the woman in command of the attack was Jill
Valentine, because she had different hair color. Weird. (I watched
the ending again and it still doesn't look like her, but the voice
sounds just like her.)

As I was watching, my PS3 detected a Cinavia watermark. What cool
technology! I had to switch to watching on the PC.

It is interesting that this movie made significantly more money
than the others. Good for them. The production value is definitely
up from the others. (Although I'd say that only the second was
"bad" on that front. The first wasn't good, but I think it was good
for its time.)

Regarding the Wikipedia summary of the reception: I agree that
there is a large amount of slow motion which seems incredibly
tedious---especially in Claire's fight in the shower. The action is
slower paced in general, but I think that is good, because you can
appreciate it more.

<div class="entry-content">This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It's basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn't really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We've gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine---again
there's basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it's fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the "domesticated" zombie acts. It's really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.

On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe... inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.

<div class="entry-content">This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements--for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I'm glad they didn't kill any kids.)

There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to "Kill all
STARS" and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis' display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.

Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements---something that is actually kind of rare---I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel... a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.

Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.

I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.

Overall, I can't say I like this. [Roger Ebert's review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023) is funny;
"The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children."

<div class="entry-content">The wife and I watched this tonight. It's a very funny premise: a
world where no one can lie and the first instance thereof. They do
a good job world-building and making the setting seem real. I love
how all the waiters and waitresses say horrible things to the
guests. The religious sub-plot is much cooler than the romantic
sub-plot, and I think they could have/should have followed that
further---with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it's just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.

<div class="entry-content">I watched this because I listened to Retronauts and they talked
about it. I remember seeing it when it first came out and I enjoyed
it---as far as random action movies are enjoyable. The second time
around I continued enjoying it on that level. The CG effects are
pretty poorly integrated, but other than that it is really an on
par movie. I don't mind that the movie doesn't directly reference
anything in the game, because I think that it definitely feels like
it could be in the same universe. I enjoy that about it... it is
not stuck with decisions of the games and can do its own thing. On
the other hand, I read the original script by George Romero and
that it was pretty awesome and would have made a much better,
awesome movie.

subtle. For example, in an early scene George pressures Yukari into

incredibly clear that his real intentions were to force her to
stand up for herself by ensuring that inaction would lead to
something she definitely couldn't accept. It's got all the elements
of a great movie: fun, cute people, drama, love, beautiful
costumes, etc. At many times in the movie, I thought it was going
to go one way, but was wrong. For example, at one point their
consignment clothes are returned and they give up working together;
I assumed that Yukari---with her school skills---would create some
sort of advertising campaign and make their business work. Nope. I
like being surprised though. =) The music was also awesome.

Accidentally, I rented a bootleg DVD. So, it was blurry, and I
think some parts were cut, and the subtitles were not on the

Even with this bumble, I can say that the story was cute and the
characters were interesting. Unfortunately, most of the songs were
pretty bad. There were two towards the end (the first when Preity
falls in love; and some other) that were actually good though.

Recommendation: Decent, but bear through the first few songs and

<div class="entry-content">Khushi stars Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Kapoor.

Story: The story was pretty cute and without some of the more
ridiculous things that happen in movies like this. The first five
minutes are particularly cheeseball though, so don't be turned off
right away.

*REDACTED*acters: The two characters are very lovable. And their
relationship is ultra-cute. Basically, they fight all the time
about little things... Kareena always mistakes what Fardeen means
and this is humourous. Kareena is also very difficult and gives
Fardeen pain in an amusing way. (I was very proud of myself when I
got what a surprised/confused/hurt face was about--Kareena made
Fardeen call her by the formal second person pronoun, /aap/,
rather than the informal, /tum/, that they used before a
fight. But I don't think I should be proud, a billion Indians would
have gotten it when they were six.)

Costumes: Kareena's outfits throughout the movie are great; not
/Devdas/ great, but good in a different way.

Songs: The first few songs were kind of bad and there's
basically a Pepsi ad in the middle of the movie; but, the later
songs are really good -- particularly the one when they dress up as
different people and after the hospital scene.

Overall: I thought it was good overall and can imagine renting it
again to show to someone.

<div class="entry-content">Devdas stars Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, and Aishwarya Rai.

I can't say much about the story, besides that it
/sounds/ very interesting from the DVD box blurb, but the
DVD I got did not have subtitles (and did not seem to be a bootleg
either.) However, the blurb was very detailed, so I was able to get
most of what was going on in the movie.

I really enjoyed the dancing and music, particular the song /Dola
Re Dola/ (chapter 17 on the DVD.) I cannot stress how amazing it
is. It motivated me to go read about the different styles of Indian
dance, whereupon I found [this article](http://www.meissoun.ch/dlai/dlai-bw-artikel-e.htm) that talks about the
different kinds in movies. It actually mentions that the dancing in
/Devdas/ is the Kathak style.

Recommendation: If you know Hindi, it's probably fabulous. If
you can find a DVD with subtitles, it's probably great. If not,
check out the songs. (And if I know you, I can show you the one
song I /really/ like.)

(More on the DVD: The DVD from Eros Entertainment is supposed to
be a special edition double-disc and is probably much better than
what I found, from the original producer.)

<div class="entry-content">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, from the team that created Kabhi Kushi Kabhie
Gham..., is an exceedingly cute movie. Starring is Shahrukh Khan,
Kajol, and Rani Mukherjee.

I thought the story, acting, and songs were great. Actually, the
songs were fabulous. I have a collection of CDs with songs from
Shahrukh movies, and I loved all the songs from this movie before I
saw it.

Shahrukh is handsome and well dressed in the movie, although he
reminds me a frog in general. Kajol was beautiful in the second
half and her wedding gowns were amazing. Rani was beautiful in the
beginning, although I think she looks better without her "modern
ideas."

<div class="entry-content">Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... is an incredibly adorable romantic comedy. It
stars Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, with a supporting role for
Amitabh Bachchan. The songs were cute, but I was a bit let down by
the absence of traditional-style dances and costumes. The story was
great and I was on the edge of my seat, about to write the most
depressing LiveJournal entry ever, had the last plot twist not
happened.

and cute as well.

Recommended.

<div class="entry-content">Company staring Ajay Devgan, Mohanlal, and Vivek Oberoi is a
fabulous Hindi movie that is very /The Godfather/-esque in its
portrayal of a rising Mumbai gang. I thought the acting and story
were fabulous, and I was pleased by the lack of out-of-place songs
and poor fight scenes.

Highly recommended, but different.

<div class="entry-content">Raincoat, staring Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai, is straight drama,
something that I have not seen to date in a Bollywood (technically
``Tollywood'', that is, Bengali) movie. I enjoyed the acting and
the story, but Amanda didn't think it was /that/ good.

A review on IMDB writes that it is an ``art-house movie
obviously not for commercial consumption.'' I can recommend it if
you don't expect a cutesy movie.

<div class="entry-content">Chameli is a much shorter Bollywood movie than is typical. It is
has a different style -- a couple that doesn't quite connect and is
made of a prostitute and businessman, but nothing like the cuteness
of /Pretty Woman/. The story is surprising, but Amanda didn't like
it very much, although I enjoyed it.

It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose.

A note on the songs -- the one Kareena dances is good, but most of
the others are not so good. But, the dancing in the club is great,
although a bit too provocative for my tastes.

was amazing acting as a cold, heartless woman and was dressed very
well throughout the movie. Fardeen looked liked he was trying a bit
to hard to be "suave." And, Jai portrayed a man crumbling and going
mad very well, through his transition from being cutesy in love, to
crazy with pain.

The story was interesting, but seemed to happen a bit too
quickly.

<div class="entry-content">Dil Chahta Hai is very different than most of the Bollywood movies
I've seen so far. It is less silly, although still has many funny
moments. There is actually some intense dramatic action and sad
parts. Although not unique, one thing I liked was having no clue
how or if the couples would get together.

Preity Zinta was beautiful. Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna were very
good-looking.

Highly recommended.

<div class="entry-content">I watched another good Bollywood movie, Dil To Pagal Hai. It stars
Karishma Kapoor, Kareena's older sister, and Madhuri Dixit who
reminds me of Rani Mukherjee.

The movie is a fairly clever. The biggest disappointment with it
was that there was little tradition style outfits and dancing,
which has become my favourite aspect of these movies. Still it was
very cute, and Amanda cried at the end.

<div class="entry-content">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is another cute movie. It is really two
movies in one, however, the intermission could very easily be a gap
between two movies. Kajol is a new face for me.

According to imdb.com, it was the most expensive Indian film
ever as of 2001.

Rani Mukherjee is much cuter and better at acting than Kareena
