    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for a match. I've heard a lot about how awesome
this game was, but I never played it when I was younger and I
don't really get the appeal. I didn't beat the match and maybe it
would be more exciting if you were any good, but it was very basic
but not the "simple control but complex depth" that defines so
many great NES games. I don't think I play it again. I think if it
was a bit faster and maybe with more fluid/intuitive controls it
could be really awesome.</p>
