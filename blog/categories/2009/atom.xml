    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a few rounds today with the kids. I did pretty well
against Sandman... I'm getting better. But I still didn't beat
him.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we got this from Netflix, my wife said "Ugh, Evangelion?" But
I think she enjoyed it. She commented on how the music was really
good and we were both impressed by the obviously better graphics
and effects. It is amazing how much is the same between this and
the originals though. I think it is already clearer what the
greater story is. I think there are more risque shots than before,
but, even so, they are quite tame. Not much to say other than that
I like Evangelion and this was preferred to watching the original
episodes. (Although I do miss the theme song.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had low expectations for this movie, other than it having crazy
special effects and action sequences. It exceeded my
expectations. There were some badly composed and lighted effects,
but overall it was pretty awesome. The chase in Paris was really
cool... although I thought the Acceleration Suits were kind of
dumb looking... I would have preferred something that looked more
like the suit in Vanquish; something less bulky.</p>

<p>I described the movie to my wife as taking place in the same
universe as Metal Gear... and it was pretty accurate, especially
because in this movie nanomachines play such a large role.</p>

Sandman three times, once per round, but died each of the two
matches. I'm getting better though!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this morning for a little bit... a couple rounds against
Mr. Sandman. I got a few hits in, but don't have a reliable
pattern down. I really let my kids down who were hoping for an
amazing display by Dad.</p>
