boss, but died early in stage 2 and twice in stage 3 (before the
mid-boss.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for another 20 minutes. I got the boss down to
about 750... much better than I've done before. Before the X-RGB
I hadn't got past 1500; after the X-RGB I got to 1200, and today
I did even better. I feel like the end is in sight.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 20 minutes tonight. I used the X-RGB with the
Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can't wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>
