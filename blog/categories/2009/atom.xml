    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting and bizarre movie. The visuals are really
crazy and intriguing. Heath Ledger's character is neat, although I
would prefer to learn more about Doctor Parnassus. His character's
introduction was fascinating. Reading about how they replaced
Heath Ledger was crazy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're on a French &amp; infidelity kick right now, so this movie was a
natural choice.</p>

<p>I think the movie is very interesting. I feel like it's theme is
how Jenny learns what freedom is. She initially sees nothing good
in Miss Stubbs but drudgery. The glamour in David's life is
attractive, but it isn't earned and it has ugliness underneath it:
Helen gets no respect and is treated like a pet by Danny and David,
not to mention the crime. Jenny learns that this kind of freedom
has those risks and the cost of integrity. She is then surprised to
learn that liars lie and is told this in a clever way by Danny. We
later she her discovering true freedom (the joy of Miss Stubbs'
independence) and becoming the boss of the boys at Oxford.</p>

<p>I feel like the creepitude of their age gap is larger avoided, but
when it comes out, is particularly weird, but not in a truly
uncomfortable way.</p>

<p>I loved Jenny's comment in the evening in Paris. =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really neat movie. I didn't know anything about Coco
Chanel, besides who she was and that she had a major influence on
women's fashion. It was very interesting to learn about her life
before getting in to the fashion world. I like the subtlety of the
movie.</p>
