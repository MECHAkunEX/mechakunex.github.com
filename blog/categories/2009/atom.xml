    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>

<p>Total time: 4:18</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whereas the first Rebuild movie was almost exactly the same, but
with slightly different dialogue and scenes, but otherwise the
same, except for the technology. This movie was very
different... Mari is a whole new character... and the interactions
with Asuka and how she came were totally different. I really
enjoyed the changes, especially with Asuka. I thought the ending
was crazy and much clearer than the corresponding part in the
series. Although I'm kind of surprised that this is the point it
ends at... I feel like there can't be two more movies worth of
content, but I'm excited to find out what there's going to be
there.</p>

against Sandman... I'm getting better. But I still didn't beat
him.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we got this from Netflix, my wife said "Ugh, Evangelion?" But
I think she enjoyed it. She commented on how the music was really
good and we were both impressed by the obviously better graphics
and effects. It is amazing how much is the same between this and
the originals though. I think it is already clearer what the
greater story is. I think there are more risque shots than before,
but, even so, they are quite tame. Not much to say other than that
I like Evangelion and this was preferred to watching the original
episodes. (Although I do miss the theme song.)</p>
