    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was really surprised by the quality of this movie. I assumed that
because it didn't star Kate Beckinsale it would be a cheap version
of the world. But actually, I think it is the best yet; although it
wouldn't be very good without the first movie, obviously. It gives
a lot better context to the first movie and makes a lot of what
seems strange about the mythology a lot more reasonable. The story
is a lot more coherent and reasonable and the action is noticeably
slower, so you can appreciate it a bit more.</p>

<p>The development of the romance between Lucian and Sonja is totally
ignored, apart from a glance when they are kids.</p>

<p>Rhona Mitra really does look like Kate Beckinsale.</p>

<p>It's cool that the giant black werewolf from the first scene of the
first movie is one of Lucian's oldest friends. A nice little nod to
people paying attention.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that <em>could</em> happen given the way she's set it up.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a pretty bad movie, but bad in that way that Pringles are,
where you think they are good while you're eating them, but every
so often you think "What am I doing?" and afterward as you reflect
on it, you regret. You should read the Wikipedia page on the
Critical Reception. I very much agree. There are a few funny
moments, but overall it feels so fake. The best part is how
realistic the tour members are. I direct tours, actually, and I
find a lot of it to be true to life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched this movie tonight. I heard a lot about it when it came
out, suggesting that it was a lame movie, but with some cool 3D
effects. Obviously I didn't watch it in 3D, but I found the normal
effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It's the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it's pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game in Arcade mode today (normally, I play it once
a month and I've been doing Ragnar's story) and got to the end. I
think I will try some of the other characters over the next little
bit, but I'll practically consider it mostly done. I like Street
Fighter much more given my experience with this game. The story is
super super Anime. The graphics are gorgeous. But, the systems are
not as appealing or intuitive to me, but I have more experience
with SF, so I like it better.</p>
