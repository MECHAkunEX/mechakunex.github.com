<div class="entry-content">This was an interesting and bizarre movie. The visuals are really
crazy and intriguing. Heath Ledger's character is neat, although I
would prefer to learn more about Doctor Parnassus. His character's
introduction was fascinating. Reading about how they replaced
Heath Ledger was crazy.

<div class="entry-content">We're on a French & infidelity kick right now, so this movie was a
natural choice.

I think the movie is very interesting. I feel like it's theme is
how Jenny learns what freedom is. She initially sees nothing good
in Miss Stubbs but drudgery. The glamour in David's life is
attractive, but it isn't earned and it has ugliness underneath it:
Helen gets no respect and is treated like a pet by Danny and David,
not to mention the crime. Jenny learns that this kind of freedom
has those risks and the cost of integrity. She is then surprised to
learn that liars lie and is told this in a clever way by Danny. We
later she her discovering true freedom (the joy of Miss Stubbs'
independence) and becoming the boss of the boys at Oxford.

I feel like the creepitude of their age gap is larger avoided, but
when it comes out, is particularly weird, but not in a truly
uncomfortable way.

I loved Jenny's comment in the evening in Paris. =)

Chanel, besides who she was and that she had a major influence on
women's fashion. It was very interesting to learn about her life
before getting in to the fashion world. I like the subtlety of the
movie.

about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down

him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.

I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.

<div class="entry-content">Whereas the first Rebuild movie was almost exactly the same, but
with slightly different dialogue and scenes, but otherwise the
same, except for the technology. This movie was very
different... Mari is a whole new character... and the interactions
with Asuka and how she came were totally different. I really
enjoyed the changes, especially with Asuka. I thought the ending
was crazy and much clearer than the corresponding part in the
series. Although I'm kind of surprised that this is the point it
ends at... I feel like there can't be two more movies worth of
content, but I'm excited to find out what there's going to be
there.

<div class="entry-content">When we got this from Netflix, my wife said "Ugh, Evangelion?" But
I think she enjoyed it. She commented on how the music was really
good and we were both impressed by the obviously better graphics
and effects. It is amazing how much is the same between this and
the originals though. I think it is already clearer what the
greater story is. I think there are more risque shots than before,
but, even so, they are quite tame. Not much to say other than that
I like Evangelion and this was preferred to watching the original
episodes. (Although I do miss the theme song.)

<div class="entry-content">I had low expectations for this movie, other than it having crazy
special effects and action sequences. It exceeded my
expectations. There were some badly composed and lighted effects,
but overall it was pretty awesome. The chase in Paris was really
cool... although I thought the Acceleration Suits were kind of
dumb looking... I would have preferred something that looked more
like the suit in Vanquish; something less bulky.

I described the movie to my wife as taking place in the same
universe as Metal Gear... and it was pretty accurate, especially
because in this movie nanomachines play such a large role.

<div class="entry-content">I played this afternoon for like an hour. I got up to Bald
Bull. During the fight with Soda Popinski that I won, I was in the
second round and had him down twice and he got me down for the
second time... I considered restarting, but didn't and won. Woot!

Later in the day I played for a bit more and got to
Mr. Sandman. He's really really hard. I've decided to put this as
"Scheduled" game and play it weekly until I beat him, rather than
burning a lot of time all at once.

I'm kind of appalled that I was able to get to the end so
quickly, but I know it will take a while to beat Sandman and
online I read that there is another round of fighting every enemy
during Title Defense. So it will be a fun experience, but not
really something you can binge on too much.

almost, but not quite, identical to the NES version. There are
some things that are better and more convenient (like Saves and
Retry in the middle of a match) but other than that it's just

<div class="entry-content">The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.

The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It's as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn't possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.

I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.

I teared up in the District 11 scene.

Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?

It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.

Haymitch's story is great.

The amount of "food porn" in the books never gets old, strangely.

Katniss' private session with the Gamemakers :)

The pre-Games interviews were amazing.

The end of Part II is waaaay intense.

I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss' body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she'll say she's "naked" or talk about
her "breasts" and most often she mentions her "underwear",
"underclothes", or "undergarment". It's particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we're so often given.

The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.

<div class="entry-content">This movie has a very unique and interesting premise: a dystopia
where vampires have become the norm and humans are rare. The
beginning of the movie, where you learn about what normal vampire
culture is like, is the best and most interesting part of the
movie. The rest of it lacks any unifying idea that brings it
weight. The cure is discovered to be controlled sunlight, but no
explanation is given why this would work. The cure turns out to be
contagious, so when a former vampire is fed from the feeder is
cured. There's no explanation offered, although I would have liked
some pseudo-science. The rest of the movie is some pretty routine
chase and fight sequences. The movie feels very much like an
allegory about American imperialism and the ethic of kids who join
the military, combined with standard liberal concerns about oil,
etc. The other great missed opportunity is more guilt and attention
given to the main "bad guy"'s interaction with his daughter.

Overall, I'd say the movie was a disappointment. It wasn't totally
terrible; I can definitely think of worse movies. But the majority
of what I got out of it, I would have had by just reading the
Wikipedia page.

<div class="entry-content">Thinking about this movie the day after, there are some things
really strange about it:

All the movies more or less establish the vampires as basically in
the right, with the werewolves being too uncontrolled to be safe
for humans. Almost as if the vampires are protecting humans from
the immortals---especially given that they have a cultural
imperative to not consume human blood. (Viktor is a "bad" vampire
almost entirely because he sometimes breaks this rule.)

The first movie mixes this a little bit, portraying Lucian as
having been wronged and the vampires, especially Viktor, overly
prejudiced. But, it doesn't give Lucian any motives other than
revenge on vampires. Given that he is involved in offensive action,
it's not as if the vampires are simply out to get him. The war is
reciprocal.

The second movie really lays on the thick that danger of the
werewolves with the flash back sequences, but otherwise doesn't
really develop the reason for the conflict. It's basically just
sibling rivalry. (The movie is also weird because it makes very
little sense that Markus would act as he does now, as opposed to in
any of the previous 100 year periods where he was the sole reigning
vampire elder. It's especially incomprehensible why he destroys his
coven.)

The third movie doesn't really explain why Lucian would continue to
fight the vampires. It presents him as unassailably moral and a
freedom fighter. But once he gets his freedom, why does he have any
reason to continue fighting? Especially given that he thinks Viktor
is dead.

I presume that this won't be resolved or explained in the last
movie. But maybe not? It seems like Selene is the oldest vampire
that we've heard of it that is still alive and there has never been
any ranking werewolves other than Lucian and William.

<div class="entry-content">I was really surprised by the quality of this movie. I assumed that
because it didn't star Kate Beckinsale it would be a cheap version
of the world. But actually, I think it is the best yet; although it
wouldn't be very good without the first movie, obviously. It gives
a lot better context to the first movie and makes a lot of what
seems strange about the mythology a lot more reasonable. The story
is a lot more coherent and reasonable and the action is noticeably
slower, so you can appreciate it a bit more.

The development of the romance between Lucian and Sonja is totally
ignored, apart from a glance when they are kids.

Rhona Mitra really does look like Kate Beckinsale.

It's cool that the giant black werewolf from the first scene of the
first movie is one of Lucian's oldest friends. A nice little nod to
people paying attention.

<div class="entry-content">My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that *could* happen given the way she's set it up.

Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.

<div class="entry-content">I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn't read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn't select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I'd never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time... which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn't.

<div class="entry-content">I played this game in Arcade mode today (normally, I play it once
a month and I've been doing Ragnar's story) and got to the end. I
think I will try some of the other characters over the next little
bit, but I'll practically consider it mostly done. I like Street
Fighter much more given my experience with this game. The story is
super super Anime. The graphics are gorgeous. But, the systems are
not as appealing or intuitive to me, but I have more experience
with SF, so I like it better.

<div class="entry-content">The wife and I watched this tonight. It's a very funny premise: a
world where no one can lie and the first instance thereof. They do
a good job world-building and making the setting seem real. I love
how all the waiters and waitresses say horrible things to the
guests. The religious sub-plot is much cooler than the romantic
sub-plot, and I think they could have/should have followed that
further---with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it's just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.

almost 6 months since I started this fight :) In the next fight, I
got him down to 238 but didn't get the final two charge shots

is this was my first round with him today; a few days ago I played
S&P for about 30 or 40 minutes playing this fight over and over

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/10/Game--Final-Fantasy-13--PS3--2009--6/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 (PS3, 2009) (7)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-01-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I decided to play through Final Fantasy 13 again in preparation
for Final Fantasy 13-2's release.

I started on 2011/11/26 and finished on 2012/01/09 and played it
basically every day. I intended to just critical path the story
and not do any side quests or grinding of any kind. I kept that up
until the final boss area. It took 23 hours (23:15) to get to Gran
Pulse, about 12 hours (34:40) to get through Pulse and then 3
hours (38:45) to get to the final area. At that point I decided
that I would get all the achievements, so I grinded for 30 hours
(64:30), then did side quests for about 9 hours (73:45), then
grinded a bit more (77:57), then beat the game (79:56), and then
finished the remaining side quests and trophies (88:54). It was
interesting that this was the same amount of time as the last time
I played through and didn't get everything.

Playing through the second time really solidified for me how
awesome this game is. It does an amazing job at making the combat
section action-packed and skill based. I remember being totally
destroyed by a few bosses the first time through the game; and
this time even though I was less powerful after I was beat once, I
could re-orient my strategy based on a better understanding of the
mechanics and conquer it.

I still think there are some improvements that could be made. I
noticed that the voice acting throughout Pulse is much worse than
the rest of the voice acting. I was bugged by how important
position was in combat, even though you can't really influence
it. I was also re-convinced that the game is way too stingy on
money and experience.

But nevertheless, it was amazing and it definitely enters the FF
canon for me. I look forward to the next one with great
anticipation.

<div class="entry-content">I played inFAMOUS last night. I'm glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the "So, sorry, Sony" program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.

At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.

The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.

I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.

Ba-leted!

<div class="entry-content">I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.

It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn't interested in doing more.

I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don't really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I've thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.

social links with a walkthrough and got all the remaining Personas
(there were five more I needed.) I just played 30 minutes a day
and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies
except bosses, because my MC was soooo powerful. Overall, it
wasn't as good as the first time. I can't tell if it is because
I'd done it before, or because being a girl wasn't as exciting. I
can't really get excited about wooing boys. :) There are
definitely some good jokes if you know what happens to the guy.

<div class="entry-content">I just finished Shatter.

This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a "bullet hall" influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It's really a blast to
play.

The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.

I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.

The only thing I didn't like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball's movement on them.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I'd never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.

I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn't
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)

I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven't played a game for so long in a while.

I really liked the way understanding your enemy's weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would've preferred.

I played as the Male main character. I'd like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I'd also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it's fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC "Buffy
Summers". =)

I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.

I *highly* recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.

* Male MC: Aeon 8 / Fortune 5 / Temper. 5 / Priestess 1

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/03/06/Game--Demon-s-Souls--PS3--2009--0/">Game: Demon's Souls (PS3, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-03-06T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>06</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Last night I finished Demon's Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.

I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.

This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you've "spent" the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn't necessary.

A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how "unforgiving", or how there is no "hand-holding". I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I'm not sure what hand-holding I would've wanted---there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you'll never be caught off guard. So many "action RPGs"
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon's Souls just requires caution and care.

So, Demon's Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it's a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.

As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of "spoilers". In those games, you can't "spoil" the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon's Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it's not really significant. I liked that
about it.

My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 2-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I'd have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.

After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote---I didn't really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I'd have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.

I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn't realize he'd be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would've just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.

The only "bug" I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.

Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight

Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7

Soul Level: 91

Throughout the game I used this equipment:

Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow    

This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)

Overall, the game was very good. I don't think I'm interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it's just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.

<div class="entry-content">For approximately the last year, I've been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a "Perfect" score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.

I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.

<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing 3D Dot Game Heroes.

I played for three nights. The first night I just started the
game and fooled around. The next night I got up to the Aqua temple
(7/15ths through the game). The next night (tonight) I got to the
end of the Aqua temple and the game crashed as I was leaving the
temple and I lost all my progress for the night. I do not tolerate
bugs like this, so I'm not interested in continuing the game.

There were some things I liked about this game: the quirky
graphics are very fun, especially the way that modern particle,
liquid, and reflection effects are used to accentuate the visuals;
the gigantic sword is cool; the core Zelda 1 gameplay is fun.

However, there are a few things I did not like: the movement is
not grid-based, so it is very easy to get slightly ajar from
enemies (who do move in a grid) and miss them when not powered up
despite standing in front of them; similarly, it is pretty easy to
get stuck on a corner for the same reason; the world is large (it
is the size of Zelda 3) but it feels really empty (there is a
Zelda 1 amount of stuff); and, obviously, the game breaking
bug.

Now that I've decided to drop it, I looked at the GameFAQs
page. It talks a lot about side quests and extra swords, etc, that
you can get. That sounds like it would be fun and add
replayability, but these things seem really buried in the
nose-to-the-grind-stone gameplay. I didn't notice many hooks
during my play-through of half the game. I'm sure if the game
wasn't broken, though, I'd want to stick around and do some of
them.

<time datetime="2010-11-22T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii.

I can't believe how good this game is. It is stunningly
beautiful. The gameplay is really fun and never gets old. The
story is unique. Wow, just wow.

A few things I really loved:
- The backgrounds are DEEP and many layered. I loved walking
through a forest and seeing the shaded groves in the back. I
loved walking through the countryside and seeing houses in the
background. The detail is just exceptional.
- I love the interaction with the environment during battle. For
example, you'll be fighting in a bamboo forest, and when you
attack you will cut bamboo shoots and they'll fall down. It is a
really subtle effect, but it feels and looks great when it
happens.
- I love the art on the food that the characters eat and the
animation of bites being taken out of it. Again, it is a very
subtle and funny thing to see, but I liked it so much I went out
of my way to eat everything so I could see what it looked
like. It made me hungry for Japanese food.
- I enjoy that the characters can hang out a hot spring to get
rejuvenated. It is especially funny when they run into a spirit,
a monkey, or the other character while they're there, because
there's always funny dialogue.
- I like that both stories revolve around a woman: Momohime is the
central character of her story, although the possessing spirit
is also important; Kisuke is not really the central character in
his, instead Torahime is.
- I /really/ like how the characters talk trash against enemies in
the dialogue sequences before they fight them. It is really
funny and the style of their trash talk is really unique too.

A few things I thought could be better:
- It was a pain to see how many souls you'd collected, because it
was on the Start menu or the main screen. It was a few clicks
away.
- The animation getting out of battle was a little slow and didn't
kick in until all the souls had floated to you. So there were
quite a few times when I was traveling a far distance and was
annoyed that I had to wait so long to move again.
- It was annoying to keep track of which Enemy Lairs you'd
defeated, because there was not "Todo list" and they looked the
same on the map before and after you'd completed them (although
not before and after you'd unlocked them, but you don't find out
the level recommendation until you'd unlocked them.)

One way you can tell how much I liked the game was my desire to
complete /everything/. The game has two characters and
three endings per character. Here are my stats for my
playthroughs:
- Momohime: 1st ending: 7 hours, 32 minutes; Level 47
- Kisuke: 1st ending: 5 hours, 40 minutes; Level 41
- Momohime: 2nd ending: 11 hours, 51 minutes; Level 92
- Kisuke: 2nd ending: 6 hours, 27 minutes; Level 49
- Momohime: 3rd ending: 13 hours, 20 minutes; Level 99
- Kisuke: 3rd ending: 9 hours, 5 minutes; Level 86

I really liked the game and highly recommend it.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/08/Game--Dragon-Quest-9--DS--2009--0/">Game: Dragon Quest 9 (DS, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-08T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.

I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.

I guess I didn't finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing---I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the "Time = Progress" equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn't worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn't going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.

Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.

The character progression system was fun---on the surface---it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone's class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn't love it enough
to really get into that.

I pretty much ignored the "quests" because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn't do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don't
love the game, I'm not taking advantage of it.

I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren't really for the solo player I
typically am.

The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I've briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.

Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn't really pay of either.

On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.

I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character's appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It's funny how
close it goes to the JRPG cliché of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.

Overall, I don't regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I'll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/03/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2009--1/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2009) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Sin & Punishment 2, I haven't played it
commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.

Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I've completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&Kachi. I've 1CC'd every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.

Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&Kachi. So rad.

Since I've been playing again, I've thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I've thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.

It is a really remarkable game.

<div class="entry-content">I picked up Deathsmiles on the release date, and I've been playing
it every day since. Today, I've decided I will be putting it on my
"play once a month" rotation, rather than my "play once a day"
rotation. The occasion: 1CCs.

I cleared Xbox 360 mode with Rosa a while back finishing with
67,814,085 points. At the time, I was #54 out of the other Rosa
players in the same mode.

For a while, I worked on clearing with Casper, but only managed
to get to the second castle stage (not to the final boss) with
45,286,742 points and #29 out of Casper players. After hitting a
wall, I decided I didn't need to clear with every character right
now and I'd rather try another mode.

This morning, I cleared Mega Black Label Xbox 360 mode with
Rosa with 249,250,914 points. I was #7 out of Rosa players and #26
out of all players. Yum!

Deathsmiles is a very cool game. I really enjoyed the last few
months of intense play and I'm sure I'll enjoy picking it up every
once in a while.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/13/Game--A-Boy-and-His-Blob--Wii--2009--0/">Game: A Boy and His Blob (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played through A Boy and His Blob for the Wii. I'd been
watching this game since it was announced because it was 2D,
looked beautiful, and looked really cute too.

When I first started playing, I was very thorough: getting
every treasure and going through every challenge level, but
eventually (as you read below) the challenge levels became
incredibly painful and I started to hate the game because of
them. After that I just raced through the game and didn't even get
many chests in the final world.

# Things I loved

The 2D graphics are really pretty. I like the brightness and
the fluidity of them in particular. I like that the levels reflect
what the world map implies about them and sometimes you can see
the later landmarks on the map from inside them.  For example,
seeing the tower from the middle of the final world was epic.

The whole style is incredibly cute and heartwarming. The boy is
the best five year old I've ever seen in a game and I love the hug
animation. Even the enemies are kind of pudgy and cute.

The vast variety of beans is very entertaining. Only a few of
them overlap in functionality, so the puzzles are not necessarily
"non-linear", but the variety of different kinds of puzzles keeps
it fresh. I would've liked a mode where I could play a level with
a custom selection of beans (perhaps after I beat it or got all
the chests.)

The puzzles are clever enough. There are a few places where you
can really break things with creativity, but that is fun. For
example, you can get birds to hit mine blobs and just walk out of
some otherwise difficult things; the Zorb bean can survive any
fall and is invulnerable, so you can just jump in it and then jump
off a cliff rather than blob-achute down. I think the final areas
(in the castles) had the best puzzles in terms of difficulty and
interestingatude.

I was very surprised when I got to the first boss battle. I
thought the worked really well as multi-part puzzles. Although,
I'll complain about them more later... that they exist is
definitely a plus.

I was impressed with the lack of text and the way the game
communicated to you what you were supposed to do and the
intentions of the blob, etc. This is best illustrated by the lack
of a menu. I love that you turn the game on and are almost
instantly controlling the boy.

MECHA BLOB!

# Things I hated

Although the puzzles were clever and interesting, there was not
enough mystery because almost every stage has a sign instructing
you which of the four beans is the correct one to use for that
segment. This really kills a lot of the enjoyment, because you're
not so much "solving the puzzle" as "executing the solution". I
will complain below about the tools you have for "executing", so
this turns out to be a big problem.

Unlike the rest of the game, the challenge levels don't have
checkpoints. This makes playing them really jarring because it
doesn't fit with the general feel. Since the challenge levels have
the hardest "reflex" challenges (more below), this is particularly
annoying. Some of the challenge levels are just stupid-cheap
too. For example, I quit playing them after one where you had to
drop a Trampobean down a pit and then jump hoping you landed on it
correctly. You then had to do this four more times, restarting
from the beginning when you missed. Since the beans bounce and
have physics applied to them, it is frustrating and unsatisfying
to make the jump correctly.

There are a few annoying bugs. Level 4-1 sticks in my mind
because you don't have the blob with you, so he doesn't eat the
chests. Instead, you drop them into the ground level where the
blob will get them later. I dropped every chest and made it to the
next checkpoint, yet only two chests were there at the
end. Arggh.

# The biggest most "shoot myself in the face" problem

The controls are unimaginably bad. They are sluggish and
inaccurate. It is like trying to push an anvil with a wet
noodle. I've read the developers talk about how this is partly
because the boy is supposed to be a clumsy kid but that seems like
a total cop-out. This just plain sucks. I think the sluggish-ness
would not be as bad if you could use the D-pad to control the boy,
but even on the Classic controller (where most buttons duplicate
what another button does), you cannot. This is especially dumb
because the game is 2D.

In general, this horrible control would be much more passable
if the game did not require reflexes. Yet, there are many reflex
sections that require exact platforming control yet the mechanics
do not give the ability to do it. I don't mind restarting levels,
etc (I play shmups after all), but that's because the games I play
that require that always make clear that it is /your fault/
when you die and it never feels like the game's fault. I can
honestly say that almost all the time, I felt like I was dying
because the controls were so bad. There is nothing more
frustrating than this.

The bad controls are made worse by some of the custom bean
controls. The Zorb, Rocket, and Bouncer are the biggest offenders,
because they are the most mobile beans. The Blobachute is bad
too.

This problem is why the challenge levels were so bad. They were
almost all reflex based and had a higher than normal restart
penalty. The bosses were frustrating for the same reason. The
third boss was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I
wanted to blow my brains out. Ugh.

# The verdict

This is a good game, but not a classic. I only want to play
classics. I don't think I'll be playing this much more, but if I
have a young friend in the near future I may point them at this or
donate the game to them.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/13/Game--Bayonetta--X360--2009--0/">Game: Bayonetta (X360, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Bayonetta for the Xbox 360.

This game is insane. The craziness of the situations Bayonetta
is in is truly ridiculous. One of my favourite parts is when you
are falling out of an airplane's cargo bay, so you stop time and
jump up the falling crates. Awesome. The fights are insane. The
climax finishes are equally ridiculous. The attention to detail is
really stellar too. The gameplay is intense. Oh man. This game is
great.

I really enjoy the soundtrack, especially the theme song and
the rendition of "Fly Me to the Moon".

I played through on Normal, then Very Easy, then Easy, then
Hard (finished in under 3 hours), then Non-Stop Infinite Climax
(the hardest difficulty, crazy name huh?) (finished in 3 hours, 4
minutes.) I ended up playing the game for a total of 33 hours, 50
minutes, and 45 seconds. I unlocked everything (except Sai-Fon),
got almost all the achievements, tried out the extra characters,
etc. I didn't like playing with the extra characters or the extra
costumes as much because the detail just wasn't there.

The main thing I disliked about the game was the
"mini-games". For example, there is a shooting gallery game, a
racing level, and a Space Harrier-like level. These introduce
totally new control schemes and don't have the polish of the
overall game. Unlike Treasure, who takes the same mechanics and
control and puts them in a different genre, Platinum Games just
implemented a whole other game and put it inside Bayonetta. I
especially dislike the Space Harrier level.

Here's someone else's [description of Bayonetta](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/09/09/10-video-games-that-should-be-comics/):
<blockquote><p>For those of you who haven't played it, Bayonetta is the story of<br/>a bespectacled witch who straps guns to her feet so that she can<br/>kick people in the face while she's shooting them in the face at<br/>the same time, and the better she fights, the more naked she<br/>gets. Oh, and also, she kills angels with a zeal that makes her a<br/>pretty close equivalent to a sexy female version of Ronnie James<br/>Dio. In other words, she's exactly what you'd get if you went back<br/>in time and told fourteen year-old me to imagine best thing<br/>ever.</p></blockquote>

Finally, a little comment on the M rating. I generally don't
play M rated games because I don't want to see extreme violence,
hear nasty language, or see pornography. The violence in Bayonetta
doesn't bother me because the enemies are so inhuman (and the
humans, including Bayonetta herself, bleed e.g. rose petals); for
the large grotesque monsters the blood and gore doesn't even feel
like gore. It looks like they're spewing lava or something. I
thought the language in Bayonetta was bad, especially one
particular character (the Italian stooge.) I was initially
impressed that Bayonetta herself never used bad language, but she
once says the F word. It sounds really out of character because
she's normally so sophisticated. I didn't like that and it's one
reason I never watched cut-scenes after the first
play-through. Finally, the pornography side. In my opinion,
Bayonetta is actually quite tame compared to many modern
games. Bayonetta replaces titillating graphic nudity with a
general sexual tone and flashes of partial nudity. This playful
PG-13-ness makes me grin and laugh at the craziness, rather than
be offended. I'm sure others would disagree, but that's how I
feel. It definitely doesn't pass the "Would I want my 13 year old
son to play it?" test, but I wouldn't be ashamed if my college age
child did.

Anyways, I was really impressed by this game. I recommend
it. Play with the volume low in the cutscenes or just skip (the
story is only good for its insanity) if your ears are like
mine.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/31/Game--New-Super-Mario-Brothers-Wii--Wii--2009--1/">Game: New Super Mario Brothers Wii (Wii, 2009) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.

We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn't stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we've completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.

I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.

The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I'm a major
opponent of innovation for innovation's sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.

This game is FUN. I can't wait to play with the *REDACTED* and his
sister (We haven't decided on her pseudonym yet.)

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/29/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2009--0/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I got Sin & Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.

/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.

The best reviews of this game are...
<blockquote><p>Here's the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>"YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure's latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>

And...

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>...</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>

The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.

The only problem with the game, for me, is that I'm a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can "Save & Quit" without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won't score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.

my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I'd like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I've seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don't need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I've played with enjoy it and wouldn't like it if they had to do
more.

<div class="entry-content">I've had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I'd comment on it more than my original post.

I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it's a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.

It's hard to express what I like about it. There's so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.

So far I've been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC

I'm now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I've been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I'll get better though.

<div class="entry-content">I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?

So far, I've really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn't mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.

The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an "arranged" soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an "Arrange" version. This seems to me "edited" or
"variant", although in most cases the "Arrange" version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don't really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.

However, I definitely don't like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles' music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.

As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I've gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I'm starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.

<div class="entry-content">I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I've decided to stop
playing because I've been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.

The gameplay is great: it's a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
"catch-them-all" with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it's the first I've
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can "crack".

The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn't
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn't realize that you could
change a character's skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn't the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.

The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.

However, there are a few key points where if you've done every
single battle before them and you've cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won't be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.

Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I've managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I've beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I've begun to appreciate them less. I
don't find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I'd rather just play the game itself. Since I don't plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.

It was fun C. Viper. I'll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P

<div class="entry-content">Over the past week or so, I've played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms---I played on the Mac.

It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven't played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end---it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.

I got the game [for free](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html), so it was totally worth it. It costs [$20](http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287)
and I'd say it is worth closer to $15.

<div class="entry-content">I played Final Fantasy 13 for another 26 hours (making 88
total.) I got all the trophies except the incredibly tedious ones
(getting all other trophies, getting all items, getting 5 stars on
every mission, and beating a Long Gui.) This made me almost hate
this game.

The post-game is much more tedious than previous games. Completing
all the missions was very fun, but the grinding for money was
horrible. I did enough to get 4 Ultimate Weapons and max out 2 of
them. I see no justification for how stingy the game is.

I would've much /much/ rather played the main game in a New Game
Plus mode with higher money drop rates so I could re-view the
story and work through getting all the items.

<div class="entry-content">In this post, I will "respond" to articles on the Internet about
FF13. I've been delaying reading any until after I beat, so I
think now is the appropriate time. I will do my best to not be a
rabid fan boy about it. My goal is to capture my reactions to new
ideas I read elsewhere, rather than to argue anyone who disagrees
with my preferences.

[Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630). This review is hilarious, as all his are. (He curses a
lot by the way.) Here's a great quote: "The idea of the game is
that the characters all look like people who someone would want to
cosplay; they all act like characters who would be someone’s
favorite character." His discussion of the battle system is spot
on. I suppose the big difference is that I love it and he
doesn't. Same with launching enemies into the air. Here's
something that is quite true:

<blockquote><p>The battles will sometimes envelop you in<br/>sometimes ten entire minutes of grueling uphill climbing, forcing<br/>you to know that you’re doing something wrong. You pray for a<br/>zero-star ranking, for there to be some obvious “right way” to do<br/>this. Then the game gives you a five-star ranking, and your heart<br/>sinks: oh god, you are doing it the right way.</p></blockquote>

Just read his comment about the monsters not looking like
anything. That's true and its always been that way. I'm totally in
his "that's the way things are" camp.

[Jim Sterling](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-167136.phtml). "If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy XIII fan, prone
to emotional outburts and so defensive of Square Enix's latest
effort that you'll get upset by harsh criticism, then you're
advised to not read this review. If you don't want to see somebody
tear this game limb from limb, or are upset by videogame review in
general, then you should definitely not read it." I can see why
someone would be upset at his review, but I'm not in the
least. [I'm amazed at how people react to him](http://www.destructoid.com/the-joys-of-being-a-videogame-reviewer-167383.phtml).

I read a bunch of other reviews but didn't really feel like
commenting on any of them.

<div class="entry-content"># I love this game.

I bought /Final Fantasy 13/ on release day---the first
time I've bought a game on release day in years---and I've been
playing it constantly ever since. Yesterday I beat the story, so I
think it is an appropriate time to talk about the game. I imagine
that I will have more thoughts after the end-game, but I'll leave
those for a second post.

First, a note of warning, in this post I will talk about things
that I consider spoilers. However, keep in mind that I have cut
myself off from all video game related discussions during the past
20 days as I've been playing the game, so my spoiler threshold is
fairly low.

I'll start off with a little bit of numbers to give context to
somethings I talk about later. The game has 13 chapters. I spent
about 20 hours playing chapters 1 through 10. I spent about 20
hours in chapter 11. I spent about 12 hours playing chapter 12
and 13. The game is totally linear during until
chapter 11. Chapters 12 and 13 are also totally linear, but there
is an "escape" valve to go back to the non-linear chapter 11
area. I viewed this escape route as a way to grind if you couldn't
handle the challenges in the final areas, so I didn't use it. Now
that I've beat the game, I also see that the escape route is a way
to go back and do all the side excursions you didn't do when you
beat the game. (There are 64 side missions. When I beat the game,
I had beat about 30 of them.)

# Story

I really enjoyed the story of the game. I'd rate it about on
par with Final Fantasy VI, which as you may remember is my
previous favourite. The game does a very good job giving you
tidbits and making you feel like a part of the world from the
beginning. It gives the many twists in sensible places and it
isn't too absurd. I think it is a bit similar to how in the
beginning of FF6, Kefka is clearly a bad guy, but it's not obvious
he's /the/ bad guy.

The structure of the game really works to make the story more
compelling. The linearity in the beginning forces you to get
engrossed in the characters and world, rather than in the
mechanics. The space in the middle where there is a lot of freedom
works well with the story because the characters are mostly lost
and not sure what to do, which you reflect in your wandering
exploration. When you finally find out how to get back on to the
main line story, the train starts rolling and brings you to the
destination. Rather than a hundred hours of chocobo races while a
meteor is falling to destroy the planet, you have a focused strike
to the heart of the enemy. Not once did the linearity bother
me.

The game does this thing where rather than a big cut scene,
there will be a medium one, then you walk for a little, fight a
few battles, then you get a short cut scene, then you repeat. This
is great because you never get bored or feel like you're watching
a movie. However, there was a single time that it bothered
me. Without going into spoiling detail, there is one group working
together and then they split up into a few different groups, with
a totally new character accompany one person. The new character
has never met this person before and because the cut scene before
this was already long there is no conversation between them
introducing each other. You just start controlling this new
pair. After a few fights, however, they have the aforedesired
conversation. That was the one time I really wish I could turn
around, press a button, and have them talk to each other like in a
Western RPG.

# Music

The music is beautiful. I got the soundtrack and listen to it a
lot. I really like the way the "Theme" is incorporated into so
many songs. My favourite is the music at the "Sunleth
Waterscape".

# *REDACTED*acters

When I started playing I assumed that the game would be "about"
Lightning, in the same way FF7 is about Cloud or FF6 is about
Terra. Even though I felt that way the entire game, I realize in
retrospect that was really my choice as a player to keep her in my
battle time all the time and think about the events of the story
from her perspective. In actuality, every character really has
equal screen time and importance in the story. If anyone were
short changed, I think it would Sazh who is a non-entity during
the second half of the game and Fang/Vanille who don't really open
up until a third through.

my wife asked me which character I felt like I identified with
most. I'm not sure there was one that was the most, but there was
something in each I can connect with. Lightning is driven by duty,
responsibility, and determination. Snow is driven by love and
bravery. Sazh is driven by his family. Fang is driven by the need
to protect and serve her family. Hope is at first driven by
revenge and then he becomes the symbol of hope and
rebirth. Vanille is the bright spot in the dreary world, trying to
cheer everyone up.

My favourite characters are the girls: Lightning, Vanille, and
Fang.

# Gameplay

Roleplaying games are cleanly separated into the story and the
gameplay. In many games there are multiple levels of gameplay.

For example, in many games there is the battle system, the
resource management system, the progression system, and the
exploration system. The battle system is the core and everything
else revolves around it. If you play the resource management game
poorly, then you can't recover from battles or afford the needed
equipment to deal with larger threats. If you play the progression
game poorly, then you are not able to deal with the many
situations you'll be put into, because you've focused poorly. If
you play the exploration system poorly, then you won't find the
resources you need or you'll die by a thousand paper cuts by
exploring too deeply without the needed resources. If you play the
battle system too cavalierly, by using too many powerful spells
you'll hurt your resource management game even though you'll beat
any battle. Conversely, if you don't use your resources
effectively, you won't be effective in the battle system.

The subtler aspects of the gameplay (resource management and
progression) are often missed by casual observers you see games as
flipping through menus. The exploration gameplay (which is often
implemented through random battles---they punish exploration) is
often frustrating when you can't see it as a game of risk vs
reward. And the actual battle is often seen as flipping through
different menus, but a little bit faster.

A big problem with many games is that these systems don't
interact in a way that is optimally fun or in a way that balances
fun across time. For example, you are going to spent most of your
gameplay time in battles. However, in most games the average
battle can't be too hard because that would make the resource
management too hard. In almost all RPGs, you'll find yourself in
some area and the challenge is to get the end of that area with as
much magic points as possible, so you that you can be fully healed
and charged for an actually hard battle with a boss. Each battle
along the way is trying to get you to spend too much magic (or
items, etc) to get through it, so that you will have depleted that
resource by the time you get to the boss. For that reason, almost
no random battle is actually ever hard in a RPG. If you want to
win, you can pull out everything and get through it. But, if you
did that, you'd ruin your chances of beating the boss. This is why
when you play most games you spend 90% of the time pressing
"Attack" rather than using magic. This is boring because you
aren't making decisions. It's not exciting because you're not
getting to see the cool visuals of the spells, summons, etc. It's
not exciting because you're never really in danger.

Final Fantasy 13 does not have this problem.

The biggest departure from the genre FF13 makes, in my opinion,
is not having a tightly linear story. It is removing the resource
management game.

In FF13, you are fully healed after every single battle and
there is no MP inside or outside of battle. If you take battles
one at a time, you can throw everything you have at them and know
that you'll be able to through the same stuff out next time. This
gives the designers the freedom to make every battle hard. It
gives the player the freedom to make the battles exciting by using
everything at their disposal. This is also why when you die you
can start immediately in front of the enemy that killed you. Your
death couldn't possibly have anything to do with things you did
before. That makes deaths more of a teaching experience.

Of course, this is not totally true. There are resources in the
game. The battle resources are Technical Points, healing items,
and shrouds. The upgrading system (part of the progression system)
uses resources called components. However, the battle resources
are almost entirely unimportant. Technical Points allow you to use
your summons and special powers. You only have 5 and you get about
1 after every battle (if you do well.) It is not hard to manage
them and I basically treated them like MP in other games: reserved
for really hard fights. The healing items are basically worthless
once you can have a Medic in your party all the time and once you
learn the Raise spell. In fact, I never used them after that. They
seem to be there so that you can heal in the beginning of the
game. Thus, managing them is never really an issue. Shrouds give
you little buffs before a battle and I never used them, not
once. They did seem pretty scarce, but it never affected me.

Since there is basically no resource management relative to the
battle system, the battle system is fundamentally different than
all games before it. Every single battle requires strategic
thinking to defeat, not just the bosses. There were many times
when I would die from fighting a normal enemy, think about what I
did wrong, try something different, die again, then try a third
thing, and get through. That is soooo satisfying. It is satisfying
on a "shmup"-like level. As mentioned before, in a normal RPG
dying almost certainly means you are idiot. If you die in a random
battle, you were too stupid to pull out all the stops. If you die
in a boss battle, you were too flagrant with your use of abilities
in the earlier battles or you didn't figure out what the
vulnerabilities of the boss were. In FF13, a death is a great
learning experience that makes you appreciate the game more.

One of the best things about the battle system, which is a
little orthogonal to lack of resource management, is that you
actually need to employ all the features of the battle system to
be successful. (It is, of course, related to the lack of resources
because you are now free to utilize everything as well.) For
example, many games have status effects which you can give to
enemies (debuffs), however they almost never work on bosses, and
since they cost MP, you never use them. Similarly, many games have
status effects which you can give yourself (buffs), however their
effects are generally so small that it is only worthwhile to use
on bosses, but even then you've taken MP away from your damage or
healing potential, so you probably won't use them. In FF13, you
need to use your buffs and debuffs a lot. Similarly, many games
have tried to use defending classes to draw enemy blows,
etc. (Cyan from FF6 and Auron from FF10 are examples of this.)
There's almost no use for this though because bosses don't fall
for it and normal battles can be won by all-out attacks. Again,
FF13 really requires the Sentinel class. I could go, but I think
you get the point.

In a bit more visceral of a way, the battle system is
exciting. Even though you wait for the ATB gauge to charge before
unleashing attacks, I felt compelled to slam out commands as fast
as possible. I had to dart my eyes around and take in my party's
health, the enemy's stagger bar, the enemy attacks that were
charging, etc. It's really fun.

The fundamental strategy of the battle system is very versatile
too. Basically in every battle you are trying to get an enemy's
stagger bar to 100% then unleash powerful attacks on to destroy
it. Most attacks are relatively ineffective if an enemy isn't
staggered, so you have to do it. But, to stagger you need to focus
more on attacking than on defending or healing. Thus, you open
yourself up to attacks, so you have to drop back in a defensive
posture. But, if you wait too long, then your stagger progress
will be lost, so you have to switch back. Thus, the central
strategy compels you into a style of play where you are constantly
on the edge of winning or losing. This makes the game really
fun.

This change to the structure of the gameplay wasn't perfectly
integrated though. In particular, the exploration game is mostly
gone. Since each battle is a fresh start for your characters,
there is no punishment for exploring too far or taking the time to
look down a hallway for another treasure sphere. As a result, the
placement of treasure is almost totally predictable and when
you're wrong there's no big deal. It's clear they tried to
recreate this by having almost every treasure "guarded" by a
particular enemy. Yet, it doesn't work the same. However, the
exploration game was always much smaller in RPGs than roguelikes,
so it's not a big deal.

The final system, the progression system, of FF13 is great
too. There's two parts to it. The character progression
(Crystarium) and the equipment progression (upgrading). The
Crystarium is a mostly linear path through the skills and
abilities of your roles. It does a few things really well
however. First, all characters get Crystarium points, whether they
are in battle or not. This is a major frustration in other games
where you are suddenly forced to use different characters and you
have to grind to get them to the level they need to be for the
part of the game you're at. Second, it is really incremental. You
can get a new perk after only one or two battles. Third, even
though the path is mostly linear, you have to make a few important
decisions. Do you go for the new abilities that lie slightly off
the path and cost more? Or, do you go for the role bonus,
accessory, or ATB charge? Do you cherry pick from the various
roles trying to max one particular ability? (For example,
Vanille's strength isn't really a factor for the roles I put her
in, so it makes more sense to get her magic from other roles.) Do
you branch out of your primary roles? Etc. There are enough
decisions to make it fun, not enough to make it overwhelming, and
you can't really lock yourself into a stupid configuration like
you can in other games.

The equipment upgrading game is /the/ place where resource
management matters. Equipment requires components to
upgrade. Organic components make synthetic components more
effective. Synthetic components do the major upgrading. Both can
be dropped from monsters or bought with gil that is dropped or
received for selling other drops, but the game is very stingy
about drops and gil in general, so you feel perpetually in need of
more stuff. There's not much more to say about it other than it's
not so easy it's boring and it's not so hard it's
frustrating. (However, I haven't fully upgraded anything and I'm
not looking forward to raising the 2.2 million gil to buy the
component I need to do it.)

# User Interface

I didn't have any major problems with the game in any aspect of
it. However, I definitely had nitpicks that are almost totally
about the user interface.

*Battles.* I would've like more button binding when switching
paradigms. As it is, you have six or so in a list. You press L1 to
select one. I'd like to be able to press L1, then press a face
button to jump to a particular determined paradigm. That way I
could have Triangle be my preferred defending paradigm, Square be
my staggering, and X be my staggered, etc. I would have also liked
the ability to setup ability chains to enter simultaneously,
rather than slowly selecting them one by one.

*Crystarium.* I would've like to see to how many Crystarium points
each character had at the end of each battle. I spent too much
time opening up the menu to check if there was anything I could
get. Even better would've been the ability to pick a target power
and have all my points automatically go towards that power after
each battle.

*Paradigms.* Every time you change your battle party all your
paradigms setups are lost. Arggh! They should at least be remember
per party. Even better would be the ability to name and save sets
of configurations for different situations. I would've like the
ability to press L1 from the map and change my default paradigm
before a battle, rather than having to go through the main menu.

*Equipment.* I would've like the ability to name sets of
equipment. I would've like to be able to use the "Optimize" option
on a single slot or perhaps fix a particular slot. (Specifically,
I like to use Optimize, but don't want it to remove my Item
Collector equipment.)

*Exploration.* Gran Pulse really needs a single map. I had a hard
time remember which teleporting location was which by just their
names. Similarly, I should be able to look at a different area's
map rather than having to be in the area.

*Missions.* As it is, a C'ieth stone that you can take a mission
from is blue-y, if you've never completed the mission is pulses. I
think they should've been a different color for missions you
haven't got yet. That would've been much more convenient. I don't
understand what value the gameplay gets from not being able to
have multiple active missions at a time. There were times when I
was on a mission, passed another mission pickup spot, passed that
same mission's end point, then got to the mark of the mission I
was on, completed it, then had to backtrack twice: once to get the
new mission then once to get to its mark. That's really
annoying. I don't think it would make the game much easier to do
it differently.

# Replay

If this game had a New Game+, I would play it again instantly to
get the story again.

I plan on continuing to play to finish all the missions,
although I don't consider this "Replaying" the game. I'm playing
that content for the first time and I'm continuing my enjoyment of
the gameplay systems.

I can imagine playing through the main game again relatively
soon (say a year or eighteen months), but I can't imagine going
through all the missions, etc in the same time period. I imagine I
will treat this game like FF6 or FF7. I've beaten all the Weapons
and gotten everything in FF7 once, but I've played and beat the
game four or five times. I've played through FF6 five or six
times, and gotten everything twice.

<div class="entry-content">I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)

I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc'd the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the [shmups forum](http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=23025)
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.

So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.

Here's a YouTube link to some [videos of the game](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&search_type=&aq=0&oq=mushih). It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.

*Edit:* I played the next day and one life'd it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/26/Game--Final-Fantasy-13--PS3--2009--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 (PS3, 2009) - Why I'm Excited for Final Fantasy 13</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Over the past few weeks I've been hearing more and more about
[Final Fantasy XIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII), the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. [GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/) previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about [what he loved](http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml) and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn't
love]]. And this morning I listened to [Active Time Babble](http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689) talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.

I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.

A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- *Challenging Battles:* Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I've also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- *Controlled Progression:* ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn't unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can't accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I'll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- *Controlled Cast:* ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don't have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact <em>in
character</em> in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don't think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don't use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don't actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I'm excited about
that.
- *Linear Progression:* ATB mentioned that you can't unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- *Post-game:* The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you've already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.

For giggles, I'll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can't think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.

(I've never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don't think 11 really
counts anyways. I'd like to do 8 and 9 again.)

<div class="entry-content">When I was growing up, I really liked fighting games like /Street

would learn how to be good, so I bought Street Fighter IV and I
practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz
Street Fighter 4 FightStick Tournament Edition Arcade
stick. Heaven! It is so sweet to use for this game and some many
others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!

<div class="entry-content">/Best game ever!/

I can't believe how good this game is. Seriously. I'm in
shock. Play it; stop reading and play it now. I bought an Xbox 360
for the sole purpose of this game and don't regret it at all.

I was worried that it would be too easy and I would get annoyed
('cause I only like hard old-school games), so I played it on
Insane (the hardest difficulty) from the start. This mode was
clearly intended to be played after you had done a few
play-throughs and unlocked the golden weapons and gotten high
levels. Until the very end of the game when you get the Inertia
Element and the Fusion Helmet and you reach around level 40, the
game is basically a stealth game. Even with full health upgrades,
you can die almost instantaneously in most rooms. I loved this
though. The very next day after beating it at 100% map and 100%
items, I immediately started again. I love it.
