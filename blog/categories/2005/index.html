<div class="entry-content">In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
*REDACTED*ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early *REDACTED*ism.

<div class="entry-content">This is a very funny movie. It magnifies standard romantic comedy

<div class="entry-content">This an intense movie. It has a very surreal fighting choreography

crazy. Each of the shinobi have very diverse and interesting

whole movie until they are finally forced to fight and they have
The Real Ultimate Power. It's very cool. The movie is also
incredibly sad and emotional; it is fittingly tragic for a Romeo &
Juliet-like story. I love the resolve of Oboro at the end. She's
super tough.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/06/11/Game--Metal-Gear-Acid--PSP--2005--0/">Game: Metal Gear Acid (PSP, 2005)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.

This game is utterly insane in concept. It is a turn-based
tactical game based on the Metal Gear world, with collectible card
game elements. You need to read the Wikipedia page's (linked
above) gameplay discussion to possibly understand how it
works. After playing it through, it is brilliant. I can't believe
how great it is.

I love the gameplay. It is so deep. The final battle is
particularly epic.

The art is beautiful. There is some great 2D art, in addition to
the cool 3D in the game, but the 2D is definitely a lot better.

The story and characters are great and really "fit" in the Metal
Gear universe, even though it is a gaiden.

One of my favourite things in retrospect was the opening movie
that was an "action" video, but using the card-mechanics of the
whole game, so it felt really awkward and off-kilter, but in an
endearing way.

I found that the stealth-gameplay was pretty weak and it was
really optimized for combat, but I think that's appropriate for
the gameplay since that's where it really shines.

I think it would have a lot of replay value, although I never
played any level again, although I definitely died a lot and had
to make many attempts on some levels. In all, the game took me
19:55:01 on Normal difficulty.

<time datetime="2011-05-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence over three days
from the 28th to the 30th. My stats:

Difficulty: Normal
Play time: 19:14:20
Save: 12 times
Continue: 18 times
Alert Phase: 51 times
Humans Killed: 97 people
Seriously Injured: 129 times
Total Damage: 29 life bars.
Life Medicine Used: 0 times.
Plants & Animals Captured: 11 kinds
Meals Eaten: 28 meals
Special Item: Not used
Title: Iguana    

I have a lot of good things to say about this game, but I have a
few bad things and comments on the above stats.

First, I didn't use any life medicine, because I never realized
what it did. I guess it was like a traditional ration from the
earlier games. I'm not sure how I missed the instructions that
they did that, but I totally ignored them the whole game. It
probably would've made a few things easier if I hadn't. D'oh!

Next, I played on Normal, because there was no "Game Over if
Spotted" on any mode except European Extreme, which I don't have
the fortitude for. This made me really mad, because I find the
game mechanically weak unless you have to sneak, but implementing
that mode yourself with saves, reloads, etc is waaay to tedious to
actually do. As such, I think my enjoyment of the game suffered a
lot. I don't think I can think of any areas of the game that I got
through without alerting the guards. That means that I tried to
sneak, failed, and just ran past them frantically until I got to
the next cut-scene (which stopped the alert) or found somewhere to
hide, but then I'd just do it again. Thus, the game was basically
totally broken for me. The only mechanics I really did were the
combat mechanics during boss fights, which I've mentioned many
times before, I really don't like. The biggest problem though is
that by not having to do areas many times until I got them right,
I really only saw most areas for a few minutes (and in a rush at
that.) Therefore, the scenery of the game didn't have time to sink
in and create a lasting memory for me. I think that's really
annoying. I almost want to play it again on EE, but then my sanity
checks and I have no desire to go through the horrible combat. I
wish Kojima Productions would realize that the sneaking and the
combat difficulty can be separated. Bummer.

Finally, the game very inelegantly gave me the RPG-7 after a
cut-scene where Snake used it, even though I had never found it up
to that point in the game. Snake just talks about having it, then
uses it, and then I have access to it. Generally these games are
good at forcing you to get things like that, I'm surprised they
missed this one.

On to the praise... Most of my praise for the game focuses on
its unique story and setting.

A few gameplay things... Since the setting is low-tech, I really
enjoy the need to heal yourself, eat food, etc. It makes
everything feel so much more real and impacting. It's hard to
express just how that is. This game is a lot more linear than the
previous two MGS games, although very similar in linearity to the
Game Boy Color game I really liked. Basically, there are one-way
doors that lock you from going back in the world. This makes
things constantly feel fresh and new. It works really well in the
story as well, because you are not exploring one area like the
previous games, but you are pushing forward through a jungle to a
base and then to the escape. In a similar way, some of the
fundamental formulas of Metal Gear are really broken off in this
game. The biggest, I think, is that the game does not feel
"puzzley", but rather the challenges come about very
organically. For example, there's always been a token mine-field
that you must pass through that you are notified about, but in
this game mines appear very organically where they sensibly
should, and no one warns you about it. Another example is the lack
of remote controlled missile puzzles, etc. A lot of the same
elements are in this game, but they feel much more real and less
abstract, which is great. Overall, I'd say that I would prefer
more Metal Gear games like this, in particular, with the low-tech,
organic worlds.

On a technical level, there are some great aspects. First, the
music and ambient sound is out of the park amazing. The jungle
sounds like a jungle. Second, the areas are huge and impressive,
not the tiny corridors and rooms from previous games. The models
are nice and the art direction controls the exposure of their
flaws. Third, the first-person view jokes are great.

The best part of the game though, as I said before, is the setting
and story.

I love the opening James-Bond-style movie.

There are many times when characters will quote people from
earlier games that fill the same role as them. For example, Naked
Snake quotes Big Boss (himself) from MG2:SS and Solid Snake from
MGS1 (although I guess in the second case that would imply that
Big Boss had a big influence on Solid and gave him that idea.)

The whole development of Revolver Ocelot is amazing. The subtle
reveals when he is first introduced that he is one and the same;
the relationship between him and Naked; the "origin" story they
setup; and the best part---the post-credits reveal that harkens
back to MGS1 and lays a huge foundational mystery for the whole
series. If there weren't so many other amazing characters, Ocelot
would've been the star.

In general, all the characters have really great moments that
reveal who their characters are. The characters serve really well
to reinforce the setting's believably and put you in the time
period. I especially like the constant chatter about old movies on
the radio.

But in the end, the game totally sold me on the amazing heroism of
Naked Snake and The Boss. They are so honorable and amazing,
self-sacrificing heroes. I know it sounds cheesy, but it makes me
so proud of people and touches my heart that such pure virtues are
conceivable. When Big Boss was honoring The Boss at the end, it
gave me chills and brought some tears to my eyes. I'm especially a
sucker for tragedy and it hit the spot there too. Another part I
loved the heroism of was when EVA and Snake are about to go off
towards the end of the game and the Metal Gear theme slowly starts
to play... amazing.

I found the philosophy of the game great too. Especially The
Boss's speech about how enemies don't really exist, because we're
all human beings and can connect on that level.

This has hands down the best "ending sequence" of any Metal
Gear. Not just the scenes after you can play, but the whole final
sequence of getting to the end---basically from planting the bombs
to the end. It is so epic and awesome.

What a game. I will play it again some day.

<div class="entry-content">I played through WarioWare: Touched! and had a chance with all of
the games. It is really fun, just like /WarioWare: Smooth Moves/
for the Wii.

This is the perfect game for someone with ADD, especially once
you unlock the Megamix and can sit on one screen and go through
the whole variety of games. I really enjoyed the retro games, but
I was a little annoyed when the control was really different than
the original game, because I felt stupid being so bad at them
initially. I thought the mic-based games were all very lazy and
easily the worst part of the game. my wife and I played the
Ping-Pong game, which was an incredibly clever use of the dual
screens of the DS.

Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot; I'll keep it around to play
whenever I need something quick to fool around with.

<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the
DS. I'd never played a game in this series before and it's been a
long time since I've played a tactical game like this---although
/Devil Survivor/ was definitely tactically-inspired.

I really enjoyed the game. I especially liked how hard it
felt. I think I only lost two or three missions (but beat them on
the second try), but for nearly all the missions after the
tutorial levels, I felt pushed to my limit and nearly losing. I
like that sensation, because it keeps the game very exciting.

During the majority of the time I played the game, I would make my
moves for a round, and then I would go do something else (like
practicing Japanese) and then look back when it was my turn
again. It was amazing to me how long it would often take before I
could take a turn again. I consider this a problem with the game,
although it worked out for good in my case because I was glad to
be getting something else done as well without giving it my total
focus.

Perhaps my favourite thing about the game was how by the end, I
was regularly using almost all the features of the combat. This
suggests to me that the mechanics are well-designed and actually
useful.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/12/16/Game--Mario-and-Luigi--Partners-in-Time--DS--2005--0/">Game: Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time (DS, 2005)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-12-16T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time for the DS.

Ever since Super Mario RPG, I've liked the idea of a Mario-based
RPG, especially because of the action-based combat. I played Super
Paper Mario when I first got a Wii and enjoyed it a lot, but I
hadn't played any of the portable Mario and Luigi games. I heard a
lot of good things about Bowser's Inside Story, so I decided to
play this game in preparation.

Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable, but with a few
big flaws.

First, the dialogue is hilarious and ridiculous. There were many
times when I stopped, found my wife, and told her some of the great
lines. Second, the battle system was initially extremely
fun. Fighting each different enemy actually /feels/ different, as
opposed to a traditional turn-based RPG where you may use
different strategies, but what you're doing feels the same. I'm
very impressed that they were able to do that.

I was not excellent at avoiding the enemies' attacks (you can
counter or dodge basically every attack against you), so I got
hammered a lot. This made me notice that average monsters would do
damage equal to about a third of your total health on every
attack. Since the players are normally out-numbered, this meant
that you could be KO'd in a single round on almost every battle if
you didn't dodge. I don't think I was under-leveled, because I was
able to get so far in the game. This was really obnoxious to me,
because I didn't feel it fit the light-hearted tone of the game
and there were not very good ways to practice. (For example, it
takes about 2 minutes to get back into a fight after dying,
quitting, loading, etc; and I never found any "Heart Blocks" next
to a field where monsters were.)

A related problem was that it seemed like monsters had
extremely high health counters. For example, near when I quit, I
would regularly fight groups of 4 or 5 monsters, each with 170 HP
and I was able to do about 31 HP of damage each round with each
character. Each battle took almost 13 rounds---and that's only if
I was able to dodge every attack and not have to heal. I don't
think I'm that bad at games, so I find it easier to blame the
game.

The problem, however, is probably that after about 6 or 7
hours, I got really tired of the incredibly long and frustrating
battles, so I tried to avoid them as much as possible. I---as a
hardened RPG player---should have known better. If you avoid
combat, then you won't level as much, so you won't be able to
compete against bosses and other enemies, which spawns more
dodging, but now for necessity, etc. This was a bad strategy
because it really exacerbated my dislike of the game.

If I design a game with experience like this, I will have to
make a point of ensuring that the player cannot dig themselves
into a hole like this. One technique is to use a field-enemy
system like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy XIII where generally
enemies can only be avoided in "traversal" segments rather than
"dungeon" segments; and then control the pacing of combat through
that means.

On Tuesday, I had a particularly horrendous battle. I fought B&BB
(no spoilers). I started playing at the beginning of my student's
final that started at 11am and got to the fight in about 15
minutes (not sure exactly.) The final was three hours and one
student made use of all the time. I beat the battle at 1:45pm. I
was in the battle for almost two hours! I couldn't believe it!
This is supposed to a /portable/ game, as well. (You also cannot
pause in battle, which I find very odd.)

Last night, I was 12 hours into the game, at level 18, at the
fifth to last boss (according to a walkthrough), and getting
unbelievably pummeled. I decided that life is too short to play
games I don't love. I walked away.

I'm still going to play Inside Story, but I probably will not
come back to this game.

<div class="entry-content">Over the past week, I played through The Legend of Zelda: The
Minish Cap. I knew I was almost done, so I stayed up a little too
late finish it tonight.

The graphics in this game are beautiful and vibrant. Many games
these days are dark and muddy, so it is refreshing to have such a
bright game. The game has the same style as /Link to the Past/,
but with a bit more cudly-ness.

The sound is good. I caught my wife humming a few of the
tunes.

The story is a respectable Zelda story. I like that the title
is a double entendre.

The gameplay is very good. It has the same core mechanics as
the first Zelda and /Link to the Past/ (my two
favourite), but almost all the items are brand new. The Kinstone
system (wherein you collect trinkets and give them to particular
NPCs) is a nice abstraction of a quest mechanic, although I
would've liked to have been able to get to the bonuses without
using a Kinstone, somehow. The boss fights are very fun and
difficult enough---I had to repeat two of them and the final
boss's first form got me the first time. The dungeon designs are
good. The puzzles are interesting without being infuriating. I
only had a few times where I wanted to throw the control (all in
the Wind Palace, btw.) The world is big enough to make it
interesting and the teleport system is convenient.

I finished the game with 14 heart containers, two bottles,
without the boomerang, with the original shield, without any bomb
bag/quiver upgrades (actually I'm not sure if there are any) and
with all the sword techniques. It was a little hard to complete
with such a small amount of life and only two bottles, but it was
obviously do-able and fun.

I definitely still prefer /Link to the Past/, but
this is worth playing again and thus worth playing for the first
time too.

<div class="entry-content">After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I'd actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn't touched
it since.

I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.

There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.
