<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn't load my Clear data, so I'm
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.

It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war... especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!

The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the "stealth" missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you'd make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)

I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don't think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I've got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it's mainly the story pushing me to do more.

It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren't counted
in the real total. Wow!

I highly recommend this game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the "Undodgeable
Shot" ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn't
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D'oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.

I can't believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia---he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.

missions, all were done in a relatively "stealthy" style. It was
very hard though, but quite fun. The story is really interesting,
as I said. I was quite surprised by who shot Alicia. After the
next battle, I unlocked a few reports, which I am now going
through.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about 33 minutes today and basically just learned
that Alicia really is a Valkyria and she's super tough. I lost the
battle pretty hard, because I did a stealth rush and couldn't
defend the forward base. Now that I know where the enemy will be,
I think I will try to pre-place Lancers behind the where the tanks
appear! We'll see tomorrow.

<div class="entry-content">I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.

The story is getting really neat and touching. I can't believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to "avenge" her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she'll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&D area, so I suspect that it really isn't
that close to being done.

This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It's very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.

wasted effort, so I played games rather later to feel some
accomplishment. I played for about 2 hours. I got through all of
chapter 11 and did the skirmish that opened up three times (Easy,
Normal, Normal)... all As (2 rounds!)... to get enough money to
buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able
to do it in 2 rounds with only 2 restarts. It was pretty cool to
have a few "stealth" levels.

<div class="entry-content">I finished the 10th chapter tonight... the tank battle through the
city was pretty awesome, although I didn't understand how the
lifts would work, so I tried to bunch all the characters together
before having them ride it... but of course they went one at a
time. Very annoying. I wanted to keep playing tonight, but decided
not to. I wanted to because I'm curious about what Zaka will be
like... do I really get another vehicle? I'm running really low on
money too, so I think I need to play skirmishes a few times to get
capital to buy the rest of the available upgrades.

the "reports" I'd seen showing up were... how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service... I mean, the beach vacation... one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.

getting pretty rough and un-cheese-able, which is really fun

score in the second woodland battle, which was kinda sad, so I did
another skirmish so I could get the XP I missed. I really enjoyed
using the tank a lot in the woodland battle though.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named "Ty the
Immortal"---I couldn't seem to land a killing hit on him... maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I'm sad I didn't get an A
on that fight.

I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
"fantastical" in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It's neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.

The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn't cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.

of battles. The hardest was the Normal Skirmish that's like the
Woodland battle. It took me quite a few tries to get an A with
Alicia. Playing the game like this makes it like Metal Gear Solid

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)---getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two---then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.

I'm using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.

I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can't do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.

I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.

- You can't reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can't decide that
you've made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.

- The game doesn't auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don't put enough Lancers, etc.

- The game doesn't give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don't see why
this is kept from me.

- The game doesn't do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.

So far I'm really like the story and the gameplay. It's a really
fun game!

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that'll be my
method... whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I'll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.

So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting... there's a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can't wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.

I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the "Imps", which I reckon means "Imperials." Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.
