    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the "Undodgeable
Shot" ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn't
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D'oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.</p>

<p>I can't believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia---he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours today. I did a bunch of different
missions, all were done in a relatively "stealthy" style. It was
very hard though, but quite fun. The story is really interesting,
as I said. I was quite surprised by who shot Alicia. After the
next battle, I unlocked a few reports, which I am now going
through.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 33 minutes today and basically just learned
that Alicia really is a Valkyria and she's super tough. I lost the
battle pretty hard, because I did a stealth rush and couldn't
defend the forward base. Now that I know where the enemy will be,
I think I will try to pre-place Lancers behind the where the tanks
appear! We'll see tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.</p>

<p>The story is getting really neat and touching. I can't believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to "avenge" her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she'll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&amp;D area, so I suspect that it really isn't
that close to being done.</p>

<p>This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It's very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a very busy but ultimately unproductive day with a lot of
wasted effort, so I played games rather later to feel some
accomplishment. I played for about 2 hours. I got through all of
chapter 11 and did the skirmish that opened up three times (Easy,
Normal, Normal)... all As (2 rounds!)... to get enough money to
buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able
to do it in 2 rounds with only 2 restarts. It was pretty cool to
have a few "stealth" levels.</p>
