further than ever before... I got to the top of the tower of
disappearing blocks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I practiced Easy - All today. I died in the second stage after
making some dumb mistakes. I don't play frequently enough any
more to be super reliable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of the first games that my son would specifically
request. He hasn't in a long time, but wanted to today. I played
through it with three continues (one on Tyrannosatan). It was
fun. I didn't do too well, but I did get the extend during the
castle stage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played a round of Black Label normal and then played through all
of Novice Normal for my son. He really enjoys the animations and
all the enemies. It is so much fun to just blast away in this
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I beat the level---The Coil. It was horrible. The first time
I beat it---after almost an hour---I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus' castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.</p>
