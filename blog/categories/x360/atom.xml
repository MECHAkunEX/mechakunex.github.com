    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I did two side quests and I tried to do a third but was
totally destroyed. I hope it isn't too much longer, because it is
getting a little tired. Nothing really to say else about the
game play today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I finished getting As or above on every event in Pac-Man CE
DX. My ranking across the whole game is 5,100/245,281 or in the
top 2.07%. It's a really fun game. I think I like the normal mode
the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it's too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I'm now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I'll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene's fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight... wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don't think I would have really minded too
much... unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42... which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I'm liking Maru more and more. He's so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene's mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He's not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they'll get them
back and save the day... but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>
