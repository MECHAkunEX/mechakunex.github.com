    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For about a month I've been working on 5-14X (Necrosis). It was
very, very hard. You had to go down a shaft, across a wide area
with tiny platforms, then up a shaft, back down, back across, back
up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.</p>

<p>Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, "Well, I think this should be the last try
before we go to church." He says, "Okay! Let's DO it!" Then, of
course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.</p>

<p>I got 38.00 seconds when the par time was 60.00 seconds.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The episode we watched tonight was amazing because he said that he
played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It's amazing that he's
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been watching more episodes and are now up to number 13,
when he introduced the L.P. Bot. The narrator is so funny. I can't
imagine "playing" this game any other way. It's such an efficient
way to see everything in the game, and he does a great job doing
things in an interesting order.</p>
