    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of the first games that my son would specifically
request. He hasn't in a long time, but wanted to today. I played
through it with three continues (one on Tyrannosatan). It was
fun. I didn't do too well, but I did get the extend during the
castle stage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played a round of Black Label normal and then played through all
of Novice Normal for my son. He really enjoys the animations and
all the enemies. It is so much fun to just blast away in this
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I beat the level---The Coil. It was horrible. The first time
I beat it---after almost an hour---I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus' castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend's commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too... like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning... it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the best moments was when he finds the card of York's
father, Brian Xander Morgan, and nonchalantly says "But you can
call him Xander, that's what everyone calls him." My wife and I
burst out laughing.</p>
