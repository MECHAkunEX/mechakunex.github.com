    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don't
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff.</p>

<p>Normal games can't be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don't give instant, infinite
respawns.</p>

<p>This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next.</p>

<p>(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them... it is horrifically bad.</p>

got brutalized in the second stage. I died during the tank rush
after the mid-boss. I like this game.</p>
