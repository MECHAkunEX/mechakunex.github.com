    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The wife and I watched two more episodes. The game continues to be
really funny. A little thing I really liked that we noticed today
was that the voice of York is different when he is hearing himself
talk than when the camera is from a third-person perspective. Very
subtle, but neat. Something I enjoy about the narrator guy is that
he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today and a few weeks ago, I improved my score a bit. I am now
3,526/248,092, in the top 1.42%. I still have a few modes that are
not all As. I plan on getting all As and then eventually Ss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It's strange
that everyone talks about York's scar.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched the first two episodes of the 100% playthrough. I really
like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn't yet done
what I did in the game, but he's done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>
