<div class="entry-content">Today I beat the level---The Coil. It was horrible. The first time
I beat it---after almost an hour---I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!

--

I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus' castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.

<div class="entry-content">We finished watching it.

The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend's commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too... like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.

The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning... it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.

I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!

<div class="entry-content">For about a month I've been working on 5-14X (Necrosis). It was
very, very hard. You had to go down a shaft, across a wide area
with tiny platforms, then up a shaft, back down, back across, back
up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.

Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, "Well, I think this should be the last try
before we go to church." He says, "Okay! Let's DO it!" Then, of
course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.

I got 38.00 seconds when the par time was 60.00 seconds.

played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It's amazing that he's
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!

<div class="entry-content">I played tonight for about an hour and beat the last two levels on
my first try (tonight, the second to last level took me about four
or five tries total.) The final level was basically a boss rush
plus a new boss at the end. It was pretty rad.

I concurred with everything I said yesterday. This game is worth
everything I paid for it. ;) I would've probably been happy if I
paid $15 for it. I intend to gradually play through the levels
again on Hard and through the Challenge mode. Probably once a week
on Sunday. I enjoyed the game and it will be in the back of my
mind for a while, but it's not a revelation.

I wonder how it is with Kinect or Move?

<div class="entry-content">I got this game as a prize from Call of Podcast for writing about
my game management system. It was on my to-buy list before that,
although I was planning on buying the PS3 version. The game looked
really beautiful and I really like Genki Rockets. I played Rez for
the Dreamcast and wasn't really blown away, but I thought that it
might be more interesting in a more modern form.

The game opens up with a really intriguing video and quickly shows
off its unique, beautiful world.

I played it for about an hour and half tonight. I beat the
first three levels on the first try, although I had to do each
twice to unlock the next level. I played the fourth level about
four times, but kept dying at the final form of the boss, because
it shoots so many tracer rounds.

I find the gameplay to be enjoyable and challenging, at least when
you get totally overwhelmed by bullets. I suppose I should get
better at using the screen clearing bombs. The addition of the
tracer rounds seems like it would be an insignificant change, but
it makes a huge difference compared to Rez.

I love the music, although I wish that there were more vocals,
like the actual Genki Rockets song. It may be that I'm not playing
well enough to unlock them though... on that note, I dislike how
it seems like I am doing the levels perfect (not getting hit,
getting mostly perfect octo-locks) but I'm only get three stars a
pop. It's weird.

I love that every level is totally different visually and aurally
from the others. This game is the perfect of a game that seems
like it was made on a totally different planet. I've played plenty
of Japanese games that do this, but most Western games lack that
kind of creativity.

I intend to keep trucking at it and beat. I haven't yet decided if
I will play through the hard mode or if I will just periodically
play through the whole game when I want to chill out to some rad
music, or show someone the game.

Total time: 2:24

<div class="entry-content">The wife and I watched two more episodes. The game continues to be
really funny. A little thing I really liked that we noticed today
was that the voice of York is different when he is hearing himself
talk than when the camera is from a third-person perspective. Very
subtle, but neat. Something I enjoy about the narrator guy is that
he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.

I'll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We'll see how that goes...

<div class="entry-content">I bought this game because I heard so many good things about it on
podcasts, particularly the "WARNING: A Huge Podcast"
special. Before playing it, I'm slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won't want to. (I don't want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don't bother me because there's just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn't finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I'm
giving it a chance, but if it doesn't take me in one night, I
don't think I'll keep playing it.

--

I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn't hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it's all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.

The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the "gas stand" is.)

The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don't really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it's disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it's also not very effective. There's not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.

The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.

It's a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don't
think I'll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I'm slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I'll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I'll give it more time.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/18/Game--The-Last-Remnant--X360--2008--6/">Game: The Last Remnant (X360, 2008) (7)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-04-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today. I went through one dungeon
and got to a really hard boss fight. I've been on a pattern of try
the boss then go back to the beginning of the dungeon fighting
dudes and back so I can gain some levels and try again. I think
I've had about 5 or 6 loops so far. It's pretty brutal too because
there's a medium difficulty boss battle before it that you have to
go through, so each failing boss fight takes about 10 minutes.

I've been talking with my wife about some of the stupid stuff in
this game. The biggest problem with it is the lack of agency in
almost every aspect of the game.

- Each unit has specific skills, like Smash II or Restore III, but
you don't get to choose what skills will actually be
used. Instead, you choose between a few "baskets" of
attacks. For example, you might have the option "*REDACTED*ge" which
has your five guys just do basic attacks and then you'll also
have "Attack 'em hard, man" which has two of your guys do two
seemingly random physical attacks. There's no option to just
determine what your units will do.

- It's not even possible for you to always choose each type of
basket. For example, generally there is a (1) no AP basket, (2)
physical AP basket, (3) magic AP basket, (4) healing AP basket,
and (5) hexing/buffing basket. Each one sometimes has a second
variant that uses much more AP. However, it's not the case that
on any given round you can choose between any of the baskets. I
have no idea what algorithm it is using to determine what I am
allowed to do. This is most frustrating with healing. Suppose I
have 2k HP and I'm fighting something that I know can do 1.2k
damage sometimes. If I get hit and get knocked down past 1.5k,
I'd like to heal as insurance for the eventually big one. Last
Remnant does not allow this. It only gives you the ability to
heal (and other teams to heal you) when you are really low, for
some unknown definition of really low. In this case, it's too
late. It is almost like the FF13 Paradigm system where all the
characters are AI controlled and you aren't allowed to switch to
any Paradigm whenever you want.

- Outside of combat, there's a similar lack of agency in the
character progression system. You have a whole bunch of
characters, but not one of them gives you the ability to decide
what skills they will learn as they progress. Rush (the main
character) can sometimes choose between two options after a
battle, but you don't really have any perspective on this
decision and it's very micro. Some of the leaders will ask you
whether to focus on physical or magical attacks, but
repercussions of this are pretty vague. You can't change the
equipment on your characters, except for the main one, but you
almost never need to do it (it seems) because there's rarely
anything better than what you have or will find in a dungeon in
a little bit.

Despite these big game play problems, I find the core idea pretty
interesting and it's tempting to keep playing and grind through it,
but I'm beginning to think it's just not worth given the many other
great games that are available.

I find the story to be pretty intriguing and original. The
production values are pretty bad in a lot of places and some of the
micro-story bits are pretty lame, but it's a reasonable package.

I feel real bad putting down games and not playing them to
completion, but I just can't get behind such flawed game play.

I was having a discussion with someone the other day about what
makes good game play and I stated three things:

- *Intuition*

The challenge of the game should require some inexplicable skill
that can't be feasibly turned into an algorithm by
humans. Tic-Tac-Toe is flawed in this way. A shmup is super easy
to imagine (algorithm: dodge bullets when they get close), but
it's basically impossible to succeed with such a system. Most
strategy and role-playing games can get too close to the edge of
easy to axiomatize. Games that /require/ memorization are some of
the worst offenders on this category by going in the opposite
direction from Tic-Tac-Toe; rather than having a deeply
algorithmic structure, they lack any coherence at all, so you
must resort to pure memorization. 

The Last Remnant is pretty good in this camp, I think, but the
place where the choice enters in is pretty weak---primarily in
what order your unions attack what enemy unions and to a lesser
extent how much AP you spend on any turn.

- *Fairness*

When you fail, it should be clear to you that it is your
fault. This doesn't mean you should know what to do to succeed,
but rather you should believe that you did something wrong. For
example, Super Mario Brothers is very good with this, except on
the ZX Spectrum, where the lack of scrolling forced you to do
blind jumps.

The Last Remnant is very bad on this category because it's lack
of player agency makes you always feel like it was the RNG that
killed you and not your lack of ability/planning/strategy/etc.

- *Precision*

A complement of Fairness is Precision, which means that you the
burden to communicate your intentions should be reasonable. Mario
is practically perfect here, because there is basically no delay
between your choice and the action and the set of actions (jump,
move, etc) is perfectly matched by the mechanism of choice (the
buttons on the controller.) Many games with complicated control
schemes violate the Precision principle. Many games have bad
input lag and other problems that stand in the way of
precision. Some games seem to violate Precision---like Street
Fighter, where we could imagine a 3DS style menu of the super
attacks, rather than the high-execution challenge abilities---but
some how do not, because the commands are tight and seem to flow
out of other actions you are doing anyways, and are coupled with
general tightness and precision. Sometimes a game consciously
makes the control harder as part of the challenge... DDR is
easier with four buttons that you can control with your fingers,
for example; but this is difficulty design decision to balance
and generally pushes the game from the abstract realm (the
screen) to the physical realm (dancing).

The Last Remnant's lack of Fairness almost entirely comes from
its lack of Precision. It is not possible for you to choose your
actions, so you know you should heal but the game prevents
you. It's not necessarily the case that lack of Precision leads
to lack of Fairness... the NES Castlevania games are very chunky
in their control, but somehow maintain Fairness.

So I guess I've decided to abandon The Last Remnant. I just read
the Wikipedia summary of the story and it sounds like it would
have been cool to experience, but it's not worth the suffering. I'm
glad I played it enough to feel like I really understand the
mechanics and gave them a chance, but I think my conscious will be
clear on abandoning the game.

<div class="entry-content">Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror's
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.

The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can't believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I'm glad I'd at least run into her
before.

<div class="entry-content">I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I'm in an area
now with just one person in my group and it's quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I'm
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It's not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.

I'm finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven't
died since I restarted.

I made it through a bunch more areas (I'm about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don't know.) It's almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don't see
the global path so you don't get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.

When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn't find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
"side" quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places... kind
of a hole... that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.

<div class="entry-content">This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting... the concept of remnants is neat. They're basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.

In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I'm just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don't understand how to optimize it,
so I'm just getting by.

<div class="entry-content">Based on my last experience with the game, I think I'm basically
done with the game. I'm pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play---5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren't tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don't think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I'm doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn't quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can't remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn't noticed because I hadn't play SMB
yet.

<div class="entry-content">So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved---I don't know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I've played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn't be able to bear doing it
all over again I don't think. At least not right away, I'll try
again tomorrow, I guess.

With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.

First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn't unbearable, but it was very noticeable.

Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad "dead
eye" syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren't great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.

Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I'm glad there isn't a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.

On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can't actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it's a strategy
game where positioning isn't directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.

On another level, it's kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select "Attack", "Magic", or "Item" and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey's) sometimes during them. Except that you don't
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don't actually choose
which skills you will use, like "Magic > Fire", you just choose
"Magic". Except that all your skills aren't always available, for
example, you can only choose "Heal" when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.

It is really strange.

Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven't
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles ("Press A to Win"-style). Tomorrow
I'll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.

<div class="entry-content">I plan on starting this game today. I thought I'd write about my
expectations before I played it.

Like Blue Dragon, I'd heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It's one of the first "next gen" games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I've heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don't
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I've
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don't really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.

I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I'm skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.

Nevertheless, I'm pretty excited about seeing what it is like.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the rest of the game... meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.

The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.

Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn't particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn't really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn't anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.

I don't think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn't dislike it enough
to quit.

<div class="entry-content">Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.

The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.

Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.

I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.

<div class="entry-content">The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I'm now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I'll do a few.

The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene's fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight... wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don't think I would have really minded too
much... unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42... which I definitely am not.

As I play this game more, I'm liking Maru more and more. He's so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo *Snow*. Ugh.

In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene's mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He's not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they'll get them
back and save the day... but how?

Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.

<div class="entry-content">I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene's character---and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery---is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.

I got all the skills for a few classes, so I've made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they've dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.

<div class="entry-content">Today I started from the beginning of Disc 2 and went to the
Ancient Prison. There weren't a lot of boss battles today, but
they were a few and a few more mini-bosses (seemingly unique
enemies, but without the boss battle music.) I got a lot of
equipment upgrades, but didn't gain many levels, either overall or
ranks in my classes. I wouldn't say there was anything hard today
either.

The story had a few revelations today. Most interesting was the
idea that the Ancients have not been seen in 10,000 years and that
Nene is one of these ancients... presumably the last one who "won"
the war and therefore is the "king" of the world, but lives so
secretively and without the need to interact with people, he's
effectively a force of nature from their perspective, and only
chooses to interact in so much as to bug them. Yet, he has
recently had some problems with his age, so he needs to use
Ancient technology again, but can't find it. (That's what you get
for killing everyone, I guess.) Although, the above summary is
definitely my surmise and not something the game explains.

This is an interesting concept, but the game doesn't uses its
curiosity as much as I am expanding on it in my head.

There were a few cute more things. I think my favourite was the
Pyre-Rat. The emotion of the machines sacrificing themselves was
very real.

I took a glance at a FAQ's TOC to see how far I was in the game
and it appears that I am near the end of this Disc, which is
strange to me, but maybe one of the final areas takes a long time?

I'm glad I have not needed to grind, because I would probably
quit.

<div class="entry-content">I played tonight a lot and got to the second disc.

Today there were a couple dumb mini-games: the wagon escort
mission and the MechaCat shooting segment. They weren't miserable,
but they weren't fun.

In Mural Town, I learned more about the world, which was kind of
interesting. It used to have magic, then it had robots, then
everything was destroyed. Still no real explanation of what's the
deal with the world though.

In Jibral, there's a really big town but it kind of loses
direction and you wander around aimlessly. I know some people like
stuff like this, because they feel like they can really explore,
etc, but I don't like it. I want focused, tight
experiences. Especially when exploration isn't necessarily fun
(e.g., in Castlevania it is fun to traverse and you fight things
on the way.)

I agree with Maru that Zola is pretty cool.

The final area of the disc was pretty epic. I like it when disc
changes are accompanied by awesomeness and not just running out of
space. There was a good boss rush and I actually died for the
first time against the knife throwing one. (My magic users were
Silenced and two attackers were Paralyzed and she spammed the
"Knife Rain" attack.) The fights were pretty tense tonight, which
was fun.

By today, they've firmly established that the plot is to take out
Nene, but I realized why I think it is weak. It's because the
characters themselves are so empty. They have no personal desires
or hurdles they need to overcome. They are more than totally blank
though: each has an archetype based on their relationship with
their parents. Whatev, I think that's why I'm not as crazy about
the motivation.

My class ranks are about 26 now. I looked in the instruction book
and it says that most classes top out at level 36 in terms of what
skills they get. I wonder what I'll choose for my number twos?

I wonder if my 14-hour through disc 1 should just be multiplied by
3 to get the today time? That would be about 40
hours. HowLongToBeat.com lists as having about 37 hours average
for normal playthroughs. I can't imagine doing a lot of bonus
content, so I expect I'm on track.

<div class="entry-content">I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks... about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I'm not totally
positive that the game didn't keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I'm pretty sure that accounting is accurate.

I've begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.

For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you'll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to "over charge" an attack so that you
go past some other character's turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person's turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there's a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.

I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.

The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a "base" to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.

Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It's not totally mindless. But I wouldn't
say I love it.

The story is pretty meh. I've been playing for 10 hours and I
don't really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.

The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named "Acornivores"
- The Devee dance party
- Maru's dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.

<div class="entry-content">I started this game tonight.

Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law's house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.

But, I never bought the game until this January---almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.

Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I've grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.

I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.

I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, "Anime!" It's a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.

In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l'Cie. Then they escape.

Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don't really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than "Get Home". I presume they'll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?

The battle system is very traditional. There's no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can't act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you'll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don't want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn't really explained.

I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.

Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don't get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.

The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That's a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there's isn't a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.

The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven't really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can't heal him
over it and I'm nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I'm spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.

I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won't give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little "Poo Piles" that say "(squish)
(squish)" when you search them. Nice!

demoting it from every two days to once a week.

do it again, even though you aren't really dying and

<div class="entry-content">I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly---every two days---and I haven't stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game... i.e. got to the ending sequence... on
September 30th, but I've been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. [Here's a video commentary](http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b) of the whole
normal game.

This is a brilliant game. It's amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren't reflected in the replay. If that's the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.

Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a "puzzle". It's not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren't logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It's very neat and you don't need to have it
explained that you are racing, it's so obvious when you start.

The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+... a game I really loved... on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.

Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you'd done before.

I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It's an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/10/Game--Eternal-Sonata--X360--2007--0/">Game: Eternal Sonata (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Eternal Sonata on the Xbox from October 17th to
last night. I remember downloading the PS3 demo when I was sick
one day when the *REDACTED* was very very young. It seemed pretty cool,
and I like Tri- games, so I've had on my list since then. I saw a
Craigslist posting about it and grabbed it for ten bucks. I
finished the game with 23:59:46 on the game clock and my A-team
was around level 53 (significantly lower than a FAQ I glanced at
recommended) and the other characters on the bench were around the
low 40s.

The story and setting of this game is really bizarre. It takes
place inside the mind of Chopin, the composer, on his death bed
and is about a group of people kinda fighting the big bad empire,
but at the end it takes an even more bizarre turn and loses all
comprehensibility. But it doesn't really matter. The end was even
worse for me because I used Japanese language with English
subtitles during the game and the ending had no subtitles. (Really
weird actually.) I don't regret it though because the few times I
heard the English voices was horrific.

The graphics are beautiful and cartoony. There are many tiny
details in the background which really give flair to the world. In
a word, the graphics are "lush"... in colour, in detail, in
scope... it's great. However it is incredibly unrealistic, unlike
say FF13 which is fantastic in a realistic way. One thing strange
about the art is how the characters look mostly like action
figures, but then there is uncanny shading on a nose, or under
eyes, or on cleavage, or even on the edge of their hair. I think
the worst part of most characters is how "stuck on" their hair
looks. In particular, Allegretto looks like a bald man wearing a
wig.

When I started I assumed that the music would have been amazing,
but it was just good. Nothing really special about it, but
definitely serviceable and a solid "good".

Now, let me comment on the mechanics.

It has a really weak meta-game, outside the combat. There is very
little constraint on your resources. Well, if you rely on battles
to give you money, you'll be struggling. However, Beat can take
pictures and sell even bad pictures for about 10k, where the best
weapons and items cost far less than even 3k. Since you can store
12 photos, this means that every time you visit a shop you can get
over 100k. This basically means you have infinite money. The real
constraint on your resources is that you always need to back-track
(the game is a straight line) to get to a shop, so you need to
make sure you stock up beforehand.

Other parts of the meta-game are a little annoying. For example,
you have an incredibly large party and balancing their levels
becomes very frustrating and I gave up around 15 hours in and just
stuck with one group. The exploration of dungeons can be very
annoying too. One of the prices of the lushness is that almost
every area of a big dungeon looks identical and every one is
either a literal maze or puzzle. These are fine in moderation, but
this game does it too much and rewards the exploration too
little. (There are very useful items in chests, for example.)

The largest part of the game is the battle system.

They do a good job unfolding the battle system with the Party
Level system that advances at fixed story parts and gives you new
challenges and options. In a nutshell, it works like this: each
character has their own turn that lasts a fixed amount of time,
they have some amount of Tactical Time before their clock ticks,
and movement/attacks take certain amounts of time. Time is
essentially your MP-like resource that controls what you
do. Special attacks are divided into dark and light categories
which you can only join when you are in light or dark
areas. Enemies are affect by the light too. It's a neat little
thing. As your party level goes up, some of these get more
complicated. For example, at the beginning tactical time is
infinite and at the end it is zero. At the end, the speed of your
characters just goes up a lot so you can get things done faster. I
would said it is almost too fast at the end... I accidentally ran
past enemies a lot.

Overall, the battle system was satisfying, but it has a lot of
flaws. First, there are things that are too cumbersome to actually
use, like switching special attack sets in battle. I'm amazed they
didn't bind that to the triggers. Second, the layout of the
characters, enemies, and arena are few in number in each area of
the game... on the order of two or three. This means once you
discover how to beat that enemy configuration, you can do the
exact same thing again. It gets old and makes you want to just run
past the enemies so you don't have to fight them. Third, there is
a single strategy that works for all random encounters and one
that is almost the same that works for all bosses. For normal
enemies, just do lots of little combos and take them out one by
one. For bosses, build up Harmony Chains (big combos) with two
characters and have the other one on healing duty. This makes lots
of fights incredibly rote and frankly a little
boring. Nevertheless, each session of playing had a significant
section where I enjoyed the smashing of buttons and increasing of
numbers.

I actually fell asleep during this game more than once. One time I
was even in battle and fell asleep briefly, then woke up and
survived the battle with the one character that wasn't dead yet. I
think in that case it says more about me than the game.

I thought about quitting the game a few times, but ultimately
decided to continue. I'd say it was worth it, but would have been
better if the game were shorter (or just better, of course.) I
doubt I will play this again. And so, I can't recommend it very
highly, despite being a reasonable game.

<div class="entry-content">I played Raiden IV a bit. I played through to the end of the game,
including the second loop. I basically credit-fed the second loop
after making it to the second loop in a legit way. My best score
was 17,036,000. (A little short of the 20mil to get the last point
achievement.)

One thing I really liked about the game is that there were
massive, beautiful explosions and the way the ground spins, moves,
and feels really deep. I also liked the way the final boss appears
to be The Stone-Like. The weapon selection is pretty cool. It
reminds me a lot of Blazing Lazers.

There were quite a few things I didn't like, though.

The size of the hit-box is really unclear and seems large.

I don't feel like the enemy bullets pop out of the background and
your bullets enough.

The game feels like it is cheating when you try to dodge some
shots. Specifically there are many times where the field is bigger
than the screen, so when you move to the left or right you move
across the background but basically stay in the same spot. This
feels like cheating because the bullets move with
you---effectively making it like you can't dodge.

I don't like it when snipers come on-screen and then go to the
bottom of the screen and shoot up at you. I was thinking about
other shooters and couldn't think of situations where you have to
dodge what is behind you---except in boss segments where the
screen is fixed and you're not scrolling anymore. This last point
doesn't seem broken; it is a legitimate gameplay choice, but I
don't like it.

This won't go in my rotation, but I got $10 worth of fun.

<time datetime="2011-08-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don't think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.

As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn't have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.

It's competition, is, of course, Bayonetta---a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.

At it's core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it's very fair to compare them.

Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya's commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn't like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta's dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.

In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.

There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a "strong" attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can't, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.

One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it's really not that bad because it's so fast and you
basically can't fail.)

Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.

On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it "as a
camera" rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don't recall it ever happening.

But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn't have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.

The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.

The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.

This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.

I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don't remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.

I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.

<div class="entry-content">I was very curious about this game because I'm fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.

Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There's no continuous spray of bullets and doesn't even
seem to be a normal "fire" weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn't play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.

I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don't think it's for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I'm too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.

a bundle of games from the SHMUPS forum.

I played it a few times.

It is a compilation of three old shooters in the same

aren't even visually fantastic. At least they aren't emulated
perfectly on MAME. I doubt I'll play it many times, but I will
keep it on my list in case I get shmup-desperate.

about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game... how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.

There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It's pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting---objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.

I'm at a point in my life where it's not worth it to read books
I'm not interested in, finish movies that I don't love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren't rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I'd like to play the

play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.

I was really excited when the game was announced, because
Castlevania games are basically perfect in my eyes. I was also
excited that it would be multiplayer, because I wanted to have
my wife play with me.

Unfortunately, as more information about the game came out, I was
pretty disappointed. You can't play multiplayer in the same room
and it's just the combat sub-system of the game, with a lot of the
progression stripped out.

Nevertheless, I decided to get it and play it.

I played through the whole game with Alucard. I was originally
planning on playing through with all the characters, going through
the DLC characters and levels, etc... but after playing through
once I'm kind of non-plussed about doing that. I expect that it
will be more and more of the same with very little excitement.

While I won't play more of it, I did enjoy what I played. It is
very difficult to play by yourself, because there are very few
benefits to grinding and it isn't balanced for single player, but
it is very rewarding to conquer and master the boss patterns. In
particular, Death and Dracula each took me a few weeks to
beat. When I finally beat Dracula, I could only take one more hit
and I was in that state for a few minutes... miraculously dodging
everything. It was pretty rad.

I started the game in April and played about twice a week, then I
switched to playing every two days about two months ago.

<div class="entry-content">I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.

It's a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.

I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.

I was playing as Xiphias and I'd never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC'd his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.

I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don't anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.

This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.

The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It's a blast to play. I'd like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)

I have three problems with the game.

First, the controllers aren't precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that's required.

Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.

Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.

But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.

<div class="entry-content">Late last year I got エスプガルーダII from someone on the SHMUPS
forum. I didn't start playing it every day until January, when I
stopped playing Mushi every day. My scores as of now are:
- ESPGaluda II - 360 Novice - Asagi: All-Clear. 217,480,251 points. #669 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Black Label Novice - Seseri: All-Clear. 229,344,460 points. #938 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Arrange - Tateha: Stage 2. 2,888,170 points. #1320 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - Omake! - Asagi: All-Clear. 496,851,202 points. #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Asagi: Stage 2. 1,615,157 points. #1675 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Ageha: Stage 3. 12,034,604 points. #771 #hiscore

I was able to easily 1CC the easy modes, but I've been working on
the normal modes for some time.

The art in the game is very pretty, but not as fantastical as
Mushi. Most of the enemies are human (they leave blood stains on
the ground, eww) or normal military-looking things, which I find
kind of boring. Nevertheless, the art, given the style, is
great.

The music on the first level is AMAZING, but the music for the
rest of the game is just so-so.

The scoring system is interesting. Basically, you get gems and
gold. Killing enemies drops gems. You can use gems to slow down
time. When you destroy an enemy and time is slowed, then all their
bullets become gold. (If you try to slow down time, but don't have
gems, time speeds up. If you kill enemies in this mode, they drop
gold. Also, you are always getting points just for being in this
mode.) Now, time is slower for the bullets, but not the
characters, so by slowing down time you build up many bullets on
the screen and you can cash them all in for gold if you picked a
good time (where good time means you can kill the enemy.) This is
a really neat risk/reward system because you can spend gems to
make it easier to dodge or to get high scores; and, getting high
scores means there needs to be many bullets, and you need to
accurately gauge if you can kill the enemy with the number of gems
you have, otherwise all those bullets will need to be dodged.

While it is very interesting, I don't find the game as enjoyable
as Mushi. It doesn't have the same pace or something. I've played
it every day for about six months and I think I will play it much
less frequently, and spend more time with Mushi.

This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of

The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.

Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it

your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn't use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.

<time datetime="2011-02-14T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>14</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">A few days ago I started playing Darksiders.

I was interested in the game because Vinny on the Giantbomb
cast was really into it and it sounded neat. I liked the idea of a
non-Nintendo Zelda game that focused a bit more on combat.

However, I didn't finish the game and I'm selling it because it
really didn't take me and I disliked it quite a bit.

On the first day, I was really struck by how bad the voice
acting was and how lame the story is. I think the core problem is
that it takes itself so incredibly seriously that it is so
laughable to hear gravely voices and faux "darkness". Another
thing I noticed was that, unlike Zelda, it does a poor job at
hiding its linearity. This was a little bit aggravating and made
the world feel a lot smaller than Hyrule. The biggest problem that
I noticed the first day, though, was how weak the brawler combat
was. It was a strange mixture between to easy (X X X X X B X X X Y
Y Y repeat) and to hard (the defense capabilities are almost
totally inadequate because of the input lag and weird hitboxes.)
Now, Zelda doesn't have very good combat either, but at least it
is a small part of the game. In contrast, Darksiders puts a lot of
emphasis on combat but doesn't have an adequate system. I think I
have been forever spoiled by Bayonetta.

On the second day, I continued to notice the combat and
actually began to think it was properly boring. The enemies take
way too long to kill and becomes pure tedium. I did one of the
first proper dungeons and was impressed with how big it was. But
when it wasn't clear that I hadn't finished and area and had to
backtrack A LOT, it was annoying. I ended that day at the first
big boss battle.

On the third day, I finished that boss battle. Man, that was
bad. The wild camera and huge hitboxes were maximally frustrating
and I almost considered stopping then, but I wanted to get through
the boss to ensure that I was uninterested in the game and not
just frustrated by a boss.  Well, I beat it and continued with the
quest. Here's a note I wrote: "This game is soooo tedious." There
is this weird genre-mixing segment shortly after that boss battle
that really didn't work.

I decided to sell the game after stopping for the night. I was
originally going to just use Amazon sales, but then I noticed I
could trade it in. Wow! Amazon Trade-In is cool!

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/31/Game--Lost-Odyssey--X360--2008--0/">Game: Lost Odyssey (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-31T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.

My completed game save reads: "43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50". During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.

As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.

The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
"Miss" appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of "time is frozen" style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.

The most amazing part of this game were the "Thousand Years of
Dreams" segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and "watch" these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those "dreams" are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby's cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim's character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim's loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here's what it said:

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey's "Thousand Years of Dreams" were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game's producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim's backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game's main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as "adding to the world's supply of<br/>senseless violence," he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being "shocked" at its pacifist message and "vivid<br/>imagery".</p></blockquote>

I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.

On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the "chocobo" music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.

The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven't played anything with better
looking environments.

There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying "mini-games": escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the "losing"
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.

The character models aren't very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good---especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that's
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It's really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to "perfect" male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming's body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)

On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.

On the subject of Ming's outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare [pictures of Ming](http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&biw=1050&bih=803) and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&biw=1050&bih=803&tbs=isch:1&sa=1&q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a "wispy" and "tendrily" style about them.

Another graphical thing: The "liquid" in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.

I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.

I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I'd ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn't run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn't look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.

Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details---like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.

In a word, I'd call the game "meaningful". There's a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.

One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn't be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren't really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.

<div class="entry-content">I picked up Deathsmiles on the release date, and I've been playing
it every day since. Today, I've decided I will be putting it on my
"play once a month" rotation, rather than my "play once a day"
rotation. The occasion: 1CCs.

I cleared Xbox 360 mode with Rosa a while back finishing with
67,814,085 points. At the time, I was #54 out of the other Rosa
players in the same mode.

For a while, I worked on clearing with Casper, but only managed
to get to the second castle stage (not to the final boss) with
45,286,742 points and #29 out of Casper players. After hitting a
wall, I decided I didn't need to clear with every character right
now and I'd rather try another mode.

This morning, I cleared Mega Black Label Xbox 360 mode with
Rosa with 249,250,914 points. I was #7 out of Rosa players and #26
out of all players. Yum!

Deathsmiles is a very cool game. I really enjoyed the last few
months of intense play and I'm sure I'll enjoy picking it up every
once in a while.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/13/Game--Bayonetta--X360--2010--0/">Game: Bayonetta (X360, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Bayonetta for the Xbox 360.

This game is insane. The craziness of the situations Bayonetta
is in is truly ridiculous. One of my favourite parts is when you
are falling out of an airplane's cargo bay, so you stop time and
jump up the falling crates. Awesome. The fights are insane. The
climax finishes are equally ridiculous. The attention to detail is
really stellar too. The gameplay is intense. Oh man. This game is
great.

I really enjoy the soundtrack, especially the theme song and
the rendition of "Fly Me to the Moon".

I played through on Normal, then Very Easy, then Easy, then
Hard (finished in under 3 hours), then Non-Stop Infinite Climax
(the hardest difficulty, crazy name huh?) (finished in 3 hours, 4
minutes.) I ended up playing the game for a total of 33 hours, 50
minutes, and 45 seconds. I unlocked everything (except Sai-Fon),
got almost all the achievements, tried out the extra characters,
etc. I didn't like playing with the extra characters or the extra
costumes as much because the detail just wasn't there.

The main thing I disliked about the game was the
"mini-games". For example, there is a shooting gallery game, a
racing level, and a Space Harrier-like level. These introduce
totally new control schemes and don't have the polish of the
overall game. Unlike Treasure, who takes the same mechanics and
control and puts them in a different genre, Platinum Games just
implemented a whole other game and put it inside Bayonetta. I
especially dislike the Space Harrier level.

Here's someone else's [description of Bayonetta](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/09/09/10-video-games-that-should-be-comics/):
<blockquote><p>For those of you who haven't played it, Bayonetta is the story of<br/>a bespectacled witch who straps guns to her feet so that she can<br/>kick people in the face while she's shooting them in the face at<br/>the same time, and the better she fights, the more naked she<br/>gets. Oh, and also, she kills angels with a zeal that makes her a<br/>pretty close equivalent to a sexy female version of Ronnie James<br/>Dio. In other words, she's exactly what you'd get if you went back<br/>in time and told fourteen year-old me to imagine best thing<br/>ever.</p></blockquote>

Finally, a little comment on the M rating. I generally don't
play M rated games because I don't want to see extreme violence,
hear nasty language, or see pornography. The violence in Bayonetta
doesn't bother me because the enemies are so inhuman (and the
humans, including Bayonetta herself, bleed e.g. rose petals); for
the large grotesque monsters the blood and gore doesn't even feel
like gore. It looks like they're spewing lava or something. I
thought the language in Bayonetta was bad, especially one
particular character (the Italian stooge.) I was initially
impressed that Bayonetta herself never used bad language, but she
once says the F word. It sounds really out of character because
she's normally so sophisticated. I didn't like that and it's one
reason I never watched cut-scenes after the first
play-through. Finally, the pornography side. In my opinion,
Bayonetta is actually quite tame compared to many modern
games. Bayonetta replaces titillating graphic nudity with a
general sexual tone and flashes of partial nudity. This playful
PG-13-ness makes me grin and laugh at the craziness, rather than
be offended. I'm sure others would disagree, but that's how I
feel. It definitely doesn't pass the "Would I want my 13 year old
son to play it?" test, but I wouldn't be ashamed if my college age
child did.

Anyways, I was really impressed by this game. I recommend
it. Play with the volume low in the cutscenes or just skip (the
story is only good for its insanity) if your ears are like
mine.

<div class="entry-content">I've had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I'd comment on it more than my original post.

I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it's a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.

It's hard to express what I like about it. There's so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.

So far I've been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC

I'm now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I've been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I'll get better though.

<div class="entry-content">I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?

So far, I've really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn't mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.

The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an "arranged" soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an "Arrange" version. This seems to me "edited" or
"variant", although in most cases the "Arrange" version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don't really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.

However, I definitely don't like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles' music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.

As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I've gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I'm starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.

<div class="entry-content">Since my last post about Ikaruga, I've continued my daily
training. I've made a few new accomplishments:
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.* I've been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.

Here's (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here's a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I've had a 12 chain
stretch and I'm on a 14 chain stretch. If I'm imbalanced because
I didn't have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I've been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I'll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it's time for the boss and I've got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.

I'm not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it's that important, but I'd like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.

- *Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.* This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn't say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I'm a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn't get hit once (which is good
because I didn't have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk)

I still love this game.

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I've managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I've beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I've begun to appreciate them less. I
don't find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I'd rather just play the game itself. Since I don't plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.

It was fun C. Viper. I'll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P

<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Ikaruga back in August, I've *still* been playing
every day. I've played for 38 hours, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds
according to the game clock. I've recently made a nice
achievement, so I thought I would make a progress report.

My accomplishments to date:
- *Credit-feeding through the game on Easy, Normal, and Hard.*
This was the first thing I did by October. (It's not totally
brain-dead because you have to beat the bosses within the time
limit.) I was able to get through Easy before unlocking
free-play.
- *Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 1.* I did this by the end of
November. It was really hard to get to that point, but now I get
an A without even thinking about it.
- *Easy - Chapter 1 - Dot Eater.* This only took a few tries and
was relatively easy. Done in November.
- *Easy - Chapter 2 - Dot Eater.* This was very hard, because it
requires pixel-perfect control to get through the blocks at the
beginning of the level. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIDc04e79M) But it
only took about two months, maybe a little less. Done in
December.
- *Easy - Chapter 3 - Dot Eater.* This was /very hard/. I've been
working on this since December, but I just did it tonight. For
comparison, there are over a thousand people who've done Chapter
1 - Dot Eater, 103 who've done Chapter 2, and only 44 who've
done Chapter 3. (FWIW, 24 for Chapter 4 and 25 for the Final
Chapter.) There are four main challenges to this: first, getting
through the moving block lasers that push you into obstacles,
then getting through rows of enemies and moving spears, then
getting chased by/dealing with Shigi, then dealing with the
spinning boss Uzura. Yikes. [Here's a video of someone else.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5iefdDhvs)
- *Easy and Normal - One credit to Chapter 3's Boss.* Not much to
say here, except that doing these levels Dot Eater helps train
for the normal mode well.

<div class="entry-content">I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)

I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc'd the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the [shmups forum](http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=23025)
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.

So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.

Here's a YouTube link to some [videos of the game](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&search_type=&aq=0&oq=mushih). It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.

*Edit:* I played the next day and one life'd it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/11/Game--Overlord--X360--2007--0/">Game: Overlord (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-11T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>11</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.

I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don't remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you're supposed to stop the music but
you can't hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.

Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that's what the
rest of the game will be like, I'm not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn't seem that way and it didn't seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn't imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.

I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I'm quite picky, but because I'm so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?

I don't recommend it. But I didn't finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.

Frustrating, boring mechanic

<div class="entry-content">Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I'd played
it a few times about my brother-in-law's house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren't adjustable and the defaults don't work
as well on the stick. Bummer.

I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay... like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.

Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.

Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/09/Game--Fallout-3--X360--2008--0/">Game: Fallout 3 (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Over the past month I've been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I've ever played.

I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.

I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn't use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.

That's a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don't want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don't want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don't regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.

There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.

Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.

I don't think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.

<div class="entry-content">I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips...)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:

/metaphor/

The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:

"I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets."

Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against "The Power of the Gods"; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?

Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
"only" lasts 29 minutes, I've played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.

Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.

By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.

I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.

  <h2>2009</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/20/Game--Assassin-s-Creed--X360--2007--0/">Game: Assassin's Creed (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-20T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren't that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn't even in the game, but mentioned
and [explained elsewhere](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552).

The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn't resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something "stealthily" or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn't make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn't even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It's not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the "real" way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin's mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.

An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn't fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren't necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.

The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn't angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would've liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!

Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin's Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don't they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous "gamey" thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!

One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin's Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can't follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don't control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can't have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, "Well, you're in the simulation anyways,
so it's already decided." That's true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
"ride", but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.

I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.

Repetitive, boring slog.

<div class="entry-content">When I was growing up, I really liked fighting games like /Street
Fighter/, but I was horrible at them, whether I played the
computer or another person. I decided earlier this year that I
would learn how to be good, so I bought Street Fighter IV and I
practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz
Street Fighter 4 FightStick Tournament Edition Arcade
stick. Heaven! It is so sweet to use for this game and some many
others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!

<div class="entry-content">I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can't believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.

The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I'm really impressed by
this game and can't wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.

There are some amazing videos of it online: [level 3 (perfect)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y) and
[1 player 2 player](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk). And [here's a description of the story](http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml).

<div class="entry-content">/Best game ever!/

I can't believe how good this game is. Seriously. I'm in
shock. Play it; stop reading and play it now. I bought an Xbox 360
for the sole purpose of this game and don't regret it at all.

I was worried that it would be too easy and I would get annoyed
('cause I only like hard old-school games), so I played it on
Insane (the hardest difficulty) from the start. This mode was
clearly intended to be played after you had done a few
play-throughs and unlocked the golden weapons and gotten high
levels. Until the very end of the game when you get the Inertia
Element and the Fusion Helmet and you reach around level 40, the
game is basically a stealth game. Even with full health upgrades,
you can die almost instantaneously in most rooms. I loved this
though. The very next day after beating it at 100% map and 100%
items, I immediately started again. I love it.
