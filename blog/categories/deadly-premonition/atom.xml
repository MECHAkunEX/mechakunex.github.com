    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been watching more episodes and are now up to number 13,
when he introduced the L.P. Bot. The narrator is so funny. I can't
imagine "playing" this game any other way. It's such an efficient
way to see everything in the game, and he does a great job doing
things in an interesting order.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The wife and I watched two more episodes. The game continues to be
really funny. A little thing I really liked that we noticed today
was that the voice of York is different when he is hearing himself
talk than when the camera is from a third-person perspective. Very
subtle, but neat. Something I enjoy about the narrator guy is that
he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It's strange
that everyone talks about York's scar.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched the first two episodes of the 100% playthrough. I really
like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn't yet done
what I did in the game, but he's done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided based on some consultation with forum posts, etc, that I
will watch a long play of the game, rather than play through it
myself. The gameplay is so bad and I want to see everything, but
don't want to play with a walkthrough. It's more efficient to just
watch it. I found two playthroughs: <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D3368004">a 100% playthrough</a> and [[http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/deadly-premonition/5058/endurance-run-download-urls/417644/][a
GiantBomb Endurance Run]]. I'm not sure which one will be better, so
I'll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We'll see how that goes...</p>
