    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend's commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too... like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning... it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the best moments was when he finds the card of York's
father, Brian Xander Morgan, and nonchalantly says "But you can
call him Xander, that's what everyone calls him." My wife and I
burst out laughing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The episode we watched tonight was amazing because he said that he
played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It's amazing that he's
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been watching more episodes and are now up to number 13,
when he introduced the L.P. Bot. The narrator is so funny. I can't
imagine "playing" this game any other way. It's such an efficient
way to see everything in the game, and he does a great job doing
things in an interesting order.</p>
