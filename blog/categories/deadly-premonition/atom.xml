    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The episode we watched tonight was amazing because he said that he
played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It's amazing that he's
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been watching more episodes and are now up to number 13,
when he introduced the L.P. Bot. The narrator is so funny. I can't
imagine "playing" this game any other way. It's such an efficient
way to see everything in the game, and he does a great job doing
things in an interesting order.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The wife and I watched two more episodes. The game continues to be
really funny. A little thing I really liked that we noticed today
was that the voice of York is different when he is hearing himself
talk than when the camera is from a third-person perspective. Very
subtle, but neat. Something I enjoy about the narrator guy is that
he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It's strange
that everyone talks about York's scar.</p>
