<div class="entry-content">Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.

I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.

In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.

The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.

The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don't feel
like it was a cop-out.

The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.

Great game!

<div class="entry-content">I watched the Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. It isn't a
game, but it is on the PSP. It's a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn't give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.

I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis' abilities to
the form, because you can't really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.

I'm interested in watching the second graphic novel.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/06/16/Game--Metal-Gear-Acid-2--PSP--2006--0/">Game: Metal Gear Acid 2 (PSP, 2006)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-06-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">After loving Metal Gear Acid so much, I played Metal Gear
Acid 2.

The opening movie of this was amazing.

The gameplay makes the last game feel like the first Dragon Quest:
there are so many ways the new interface is cleaner, easier, more
fluid, etc. I really like the improvements. The new gameplay
mechanics (like linkages and cover fire) where interesting, but
didn't really make it different. But I'm fine with that, because I
just wanted more game. (The blinding mechanic was definitely new,
but very annoying.)

The game gives you cards in a different order from the last game
and I generally felt the weapon power-level was higher initially,
although the support cards had the same path.

I really liked the cell-shaded style of the 3D graphics.

The game does an absurd jiggling animation with the female
characters. It is ridiculous.

This game seems even more combat focused than the last
game. Whereas in the last game, there were many traversal levels
where combat was the best approach, in this game there are many
straight-out combat missions. This game also feels like it has a
lot less time in between boss encounters. I also noticed that
there weren't really any "puzzle" levels, like before.

One thing that was close to a puzzle was the train level. It was
really cool to coax enemies into the path of the train and get
them squashed. Woo!

I did a little bit of grinding to get good cards, but I also made
some really stupid decks to get through some levels with a
challenge; both were fun.

The ending was very neat in its cinematic-ness, but the game in
general (and the bosses in particular) was a lot easier.

This game probably has more replay value because of the special
missions, but I didn't do any.

Here are my final stats:

Difficulty: Normal
Play Time: 14:24:20
Cost: 4395
Found: 45
Kills: 73
Total Damage: 15035
Clear Count: 1
Cards Collected: 41 (I don't know what this means... maybe in the stages?)

I hope there will be an Acid 3.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/30/Game--New-Super-Mario-Brothers--DS--2006--0/">Game: New Super Mario Brothers (DS, 2006)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">On the plane ride back from New England for Thanksgiving, I beat
New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS.

I started playing the game in August 2009 on a trip to Oregon
for a wedding, but I hit a wall in my progress after the second
tower in World 6. It was very frustrating, so I only played it
occasionally (less than monthly), basically whenever I was bored
and had a few moments. On the ride out to Boston this year, I did
exactly that. And again as I was sitting around with my family one
night. Then. I beat the level! I played regularly the rest of the
trip and by the flight home, I'd beaten it.

Most of my opinion of the game revolve around the last World
and my painful experience with the progress wall. Obviously it is
very frustrating not to make any progress. I think the biggest
problem was that even when I could beat a level, you are
restricted from saving until after a tower or castle, so you had
to have a successful string and a long time to play to make
progress. NSMBW solved this problem with the Quick Save system,
although I see no reason to not have Save anywhere unlocked from
the beginning. The final level's maze was really frustrating---I
made it there over 10 times and tried different patterns over and
over again, running out of time and then lives each time, before
looking it up online (which was a miracle, because I was on a
plane.)

I thought the physics in the game after more off than NSMBW. I
thought that the additional power-ups were mostly all dumb.

But, I love platformers and Mario in particular, so it was
really fun, especially when you're on a roll.

<div class="entry-content">As I mentioned, I've been playing Radilgy on my Dreamcast. In my
last post, I wrote about how I wasn't sure how much longer I would
play it. Well, I think I'm pretty satisfied now.

I know that I /could/ get better, but I think I would rather move
on. In the past week, since my first win, I've beaten it three
more times. My first win was on Easy with 5 lives per continue. My
second was on Normal with 5 lives per continue. My third was on
Normal with 4 lives per continue. And my fourth (completed about 5
minutes ago) was on Normal with 3 lives per continue (the default
setting.)

final2, 2-3:5 final2, 1-1:5 final2, 1-2:5 final2, WIN!

I started recording just wins with the configuration. Then I added
when I died. Then I tracked when I spent each /i/th
continue. (I switched to when I spent continue number /i/,
because it was easier to eye-ball.) I recorded particularly
depressing losses when the final form of the final boss was almost
dead. Finally today, I kept track of when I lost each life. Also
today I switched from using the Wide shot to using the 123
Laser. My impression is that one weapon isn't more powerful than
another, but that they represent different play styles. I realized
today that I was focusing my shots at a single enemy typically, so
I might as well use the weapon that corresponds to that style. The
main difference I observed was being able to take care of the boss
a little faster.

This process I've just gone through---training and recording
performance---makes me think about features I would like in a
shooter. Here's a few:
- *Data!* I wish the game would keep track of all the data I was
tracking by hand so I could find out where I was dying a lot and
where I needed to practice. It would even be nicer if the
granularity of this data was very fine; for example, I'd like to
know that I always die on the third attack of the fourth
mini-boss.
- *Progress-based Scoreboard* I'd like to be able to sort my
scoreboard (+ the public one in modern games) by how far in the
game/level the score was completed at. For example, I'm
currently working on 1cc-ing Ikaruga and doing chapter 3
Dot-Eater style. I'm not playing for score, so I'd like to be
able to (at a glance) see if I've gotten further than I have
before.
- *Practice modes* Most games are pretty good about allowing you
to practice chapters you've unlocked and some (Ikaruga on
Gamecube, for example) allow you to practice individual chapter
stages. I'd like this to be more common and with finer
granularity.
- *Trainer* Even better than a practice mode would be a mode where
the game planned your practice regime based on your previous
game performance. It would be rad also if you could loop bosses
or bullet patterns until you got through them without having to
go through all of the surrounding game.

Nevertheless, there's something very satisfying about playing the
beginning of a game so many times you can destroy it without
mercy.

<div class="entry-content">I recently bought a Dreamcast. The very first game I played was
The Typing of the Dead, but I only played it for a few minutes to
show to Wifey. The very first game I played in depth is <a
Radilgy, a shmup.

The art style is really unique and good looking. The controllers
are quite tight. The weapons are fun. (I really like the lasers
and the bubbles. I play most of the time with the lasers though.)
The shield, sword, and force field are nice touches.

The fourth and fifth levels have these segments that require
spamming the force field over and over and over. (At least, that's
how I do it!) It is pretty insane. Each of the end bosses is
really fun. The mid-level bosses are a little repetitive, because
they have the same core attacks, but they fit well and create a
nice feel for the game. (As I understand from the Wikipedia story,
those are the terrorists and the end bosses are warped
robots.)

My one complaint with the game is that the graphics are so
bright and there is so much flashing that it becomes hard to look
at after a while. I've been playing in 20-ish minute chunks then
doing something else.

I just beat it on Easy with 6 credits and 5 life credits using the
laser. I've been working on a number of different
configurations. I don't like it when shmups have so many options,
because I don't have a good grasp of what the "right" options
are. There is also a big temptation to make it easier, etc. I
wonder, should I try to 1cc it on Easy, then Normal, then Hard? Or
just got right to a different difficulty, etc? I can use 1 credit
to get to the middle of stage 3 (the mini-boss) on Normal. I've
gotten through stages 1 and 2 without ever dying as well. How
should I go about it? I plan on definitely playing for a little
while, but I don't want to make it a permanent pursuit like
/Ikaruga/.

<div class="entry-content">During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The "vibe" system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn't proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn't about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn't finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you're in for some frustration and annoyance.

too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I'm really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don't think I will for a while.

My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn't beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn't finish the game.

<div class="entry-content">One of my favourite games ever is /Earthbound/ for the Super
Nintendo. A few years ago I heard about a sequel coming out for
the Gameboy Advance. I obsessively checked video game news sites
until it was clear that it was not going to come out in
America. Luckily, in the middle of October of this year, Mother 3
was translated by fans and a patch released for the GBA ROM.</p>

I just finished playing and, man, it is awesome. It recreates the
feel of the original and pushes it up a few notches and adds a
whole bunch of unique stuff. I was very impressed and
satisfied.

<h1><a href="/blog/2007/10/08/Game--Final-Fantasy-12--PS2--2006--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 12 (PS2, 2006)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2007-10-08T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2007</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I bought a PS2 (after not having one for years) just to play
this. It was awesome.

What an amazing game. The story is very deep and compelling. The
characters really grow on you. It is perhaps the only instance of
good voice acting in a game that I can think of. The game play is
very fun and removes some of the annoying parts of most RPGs. The
music is great and either touching or exciting, whatever is
appropriate for the context. The graphics are beautiful,
particularly in the final boss battle. And then ending is truly
satisfying.
