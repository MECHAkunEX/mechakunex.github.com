powerful and heart-breaking. The first half of the film has so
many super high energy exciting parts... like the opening and the
airport. The film has lots of great lines and funny parts... like
at the country club and between Bond and Vesper. This is really great.

<div class="entry-content">I thought that I hadn't seen this movie, but actually I have. Given
when it came out, I think I saw it in the theatres during grad
school. I would often go to the movie theater by myself on boring
nights/afternoons.

I think the production quality on the movie is significantly higher
and the fights are a lot more interesting. They did a good job
introducing new characters that were different. I like the
development of the mythology. Kate Beckinsale continues to look
amazing and she seems to be wearing a slightly different cat-suit.
The monsters look a little less like Buffy villains, but still a
little bit cheesy.

The plot feels a lot simpler, more like a roller-coaster ride where
the characters are chased from one place to the next without much
time for mystery or real plot development. It's a bit more of a
standard action movie in that regard, and I think it suffers
compared to the last for it. The cast of meaning characters is a
lot smaller with most (such as Corvinus and Tanis) really only have
one scene. The high point of the movie is probably the set of
flashbacks scenes.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the rest of the game... meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.

The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.

Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn't particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn't really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn't anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.

I don't think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn't dislike it enough
to quit.

<div class="entry-content">Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.

The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.

Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.

I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.

<div class="entry-content">The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I'm now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I'll do a few.

The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene's fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight... wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don't think I would have really minded too
much... unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42... which I definitely am not.

As I play this game more, I'm liking Maru more and more. He's so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo *Snow*. Ugh.

In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene's mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He's not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they'll get them
back and save the day... but how?

Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.

<div class="entry-content">I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene's character---and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery---is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.

I got all the skills for a few classes, so I've made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they've dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.

<div class="entry-content">Today I started from the beginning of Disc 2 and went to the
Ancient Prison. There weren't a lot of boss battles today, but
they were a few and a few more mini-bosses (seemingly unique
enemies, but without the boss battle music.) I got a lot of
equipment upgrades, but didn't gain many levels, either overall or
ranks in my classes. I wouldn't say there was anything hard today
either.

The story had a few revelations today. Most interesting was the
idea that the Ancients have not been seen in 10,000 years and that
Nene is one of these ancients... presumably the last one who "won"
the war and therefore is the "king" of the world, but lives so
secretively and without the need to interact with people, he's
effectively a force of nature from their perspective, and only
chooses to interact in so much as to bug them. Yet, he has
recently had some problems with his age, so he needs to use
Ancient technology again, but can't find it. (That's what you get
for killing everyone, I guess.) Although, the above summary is
definitely my surmise and not something the game explains.

This is an interesting concept, but the game doesn't uses its
curiosity as much as I am expanding on it in my head.

There were a few cute more things. I think my favourite was the
Pyre-Rat. The emotion of the machines sacrificing themselves was
very real.

I took a glance at a FAQ's TOC to see how far I was in the game
and it appears that I am near the end of this Disc, which is
strange to me, but maybe one of the final areas takes a long time?

I'm glad I have not needed to grind, because I would probably
quit.

<div class="entry-content">I played tonight a lot and got to the second disc.

Today there were a couple dumb mini-games: the wagon escort
mission and the MechaCat shooting segment. They weren't miserable,
but they weren't fun.

In Mural Town, I learned more about the world, which was kind of
interesting. It used to have magic, then it had robots, then
everything was destroyed. Still no real explanation of what's the
deal with the world though.

In Jibral, there's a really big town but it kind of loses
direction and you wander around aimlessly. I know some people like
stuff like this, because they feel like they can really explore,
etc, but I don't like it. I want focused, tight
experiences. Especially when exploration isn't necessarily fun
(e.g., in Castlevania it is fun to traverse and you fight things
on the way.)

I agree with Maru that Zola is pretty cool.

The final area of the disc was pretty epic. I like it when disc
changes are accompanied by awesomeness and not just running out of
space. There was a good boss rush and I actually died for the
first time against the knife throwing one. (My magic users were
Silenced and two attackers were Paralyzed and she spammed the
"Knife Rain" attack.) The fights were pretty tense tonight, which
was fun.

By today, they've firmly established that the plot is to take out
Nene, but I realized why I think it is weak. It's because the
characters themselves are so empty. They have no personal desires
or hurdles they need to overcome. They are more than totally blank
though: each has an archetype based on their relationship with
their parents. Whatev, I think that's why I'm not as crazy about
the motivation.

My class ranks are about 26 now. I looked in the instruction book
and it says that most classes top out at level 36 in terms of what
skills they get. I wonder what I'll choose for my number twos?

I wonder if my 14-hour through disc 1 should just be multiplied by
3 to get the today time? That would be about 40
hours. HowLongToBeat.com lists as having about 37 hours average
for normal playthroughs. I can't imagine doing a lot of bonus
content, so I expect I'm on track.

<time datetime="2012-04-01T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>01</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks... about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I'm not totally
positive that the game didn't keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I'm pretty sure that accounting is accurate.

I've begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.

For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you'll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to "over charge" an attack so that you
go past some other character's turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person's turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there's a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.

I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.

The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a "base" to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.

Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It's not totally mindless. But I wouldn't
say I love it.

The story is pretty meh. I've been playing for 10 hours and I
don't really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.

The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named "Acornivores"
- The Devee dance party
- Maru's dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.

<div class="entry-content">I started this game tonight.

Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law's house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.

But, I never bought the game until this January---almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.

Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I've grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.

I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.

I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, "Anime!" It's a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.

In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l'Cie. Then they escape.

Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don't really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than "Get Home". I presume they'll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?

The battle system is very traditional. There's no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can't act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you'll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don't want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn't really explained.

I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.

Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don't get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.

The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That's a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there's isn't a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.

The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven't really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can't heal him
over it and I'm nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I'm spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.

I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won't give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little "Poo Piles" that say "(squish)
(squish)" when you search them. Nice!

<div class="entry-content">Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.

I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.

In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.

The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.

The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don't feel
like it was a cop-out.

The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.

Great game!

<div class="entry-content">I watched the Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. It isn't a
game, but it is on the PSP. It's a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn't give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.

I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis' abilities to
the form, because you can't really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.

I'm interested in watching the second graphic novel.

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/30/Game--New-Super-Mario-Brothers--DS--2006--0/">Game: New Super Mario Brothers (DS, 2006)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-30T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>30</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">On the plane ride back from New England for Thanksgiving, I beat
New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS.

I started playing the game in August 2009 on a trip to Oregon
for a wedding, but I hit a wall in my progress after the second
tower in World 6. It was very frustrating, so I only played it
occasionally (less than monthly), basically whenever I was bored
and had a few moments. On the ride out to Boston this year, I did
exactly that. And again as I was sitting around with my family one
night. Then. I beat the level! I played regularly the rest of the
trip and by the flight home, I'd beaten it.

Most of my opinion of the game revolve around the last World
and my painful experience with the progress wall. Obviously it is
very frustrating not to make any progress. I think the biggest
problem was that even when I could beat a level, you are
restricted from saving until after a tower or castle, so you had
to have a successful string and a long time to play to make
progress. NSMBW solved this problem with the Quick Save system,
although I see no reason to not have Save anywhere unlocked from
the beginning. The final level's maze was really frustrating---I
made it there over 10 times and tried different patterns over and
over again, running out of time and then lives each time, before
looking it up online (which was a miracle, because I was on a
plane.)

I thought the physics in the game after more off than NSMBW. I
thought that the additional power-ups were mostly all dumb.

But, I love platformers and Mario in particular, so it was
really fun, especially when you're on a roll.

<div class="entry-content">As I mentioned, I've been playing Radilgy on my Dreamcast. In my
last post, I wrote about how I wasn't sure how much longer I would
play it. Well, I think I'm pretty satisfied now.

I know that I /could/ get better, but I think I would rather move
on. In the past week, since my first win, I've beaten it three
more times. My first win was on Easy with 5 lives per continue. My
second was on Normal with 5 lives per continue. My third was on
Normal with 4 lives per continue. And my fourth (completed about 5
minutes ago) was on Normal with 3 lives per continue (the default
setting.)

I started keeping records of each play-through:

final2, 2-3:5 final2, 1-1:5 final2, 1-2:5 final2, WIN!

I started recording just wins with the configuration. Then I added
when I died. Then I tracked when I spent each /i/th
continue. (I switched to when I spent continue number /i/,
because it was easier to eye-ball.) I recorded particularly
depressing losses when the final form of the final boss was almost
dead. Finally today, I kept track of when I lost each life. Also
today I switched from using the Wide shot to using the 123
Laser. My impression is that one weapon isn't more powerful than
another, but that they represent different play styles. I realized
today that I was focusing my shots at a single enemy typically, so
I might as well use the weapon that corresponds to that style. The
main difference I observed was being able to take care of the boss
a little faster.

This process I've just gone through---training and recording
performance---makes me think about features I would like in a
shooter. Here's a few:
- *Data!* I wish the game would keep track of all the data I was
tracking by hand so I could find out where I was dying a lot and
where I needed to practice. It would even be nicer if the
granularity of this data was very fine; for example, I'd like to
know that I always die on the third attack of the fourth
mini-boss.
- *Progress-based Scoreboard* I'd like to be able to sort my
scoreboard (+ the public one in modern games) by how far in the
game/level the score was completed at. For example, I'm
currently working on 1cc-ing Ikaruga and doing chapter 3
Dot-Eater style. I'm not playing for score, so I'd like to be
able to (at a glance) see if I've gotten further than I have
before.
- *Practice modes* Most games are pretty good about allowing you
to practice chapters you've unlocked and some (Ikaruga on
Gamecube, for example) allow you to practice individual chapter
stages. I'd like this to be more common and with finer
granularity.
- *Trainer* Even better than a practice mode would be a mode where
the game planned your practice regime based on your previous
game performance. It would be rad also if you could loop bosses
or bullet patterns until you got through them without having to
go through all of the surrounding game.

Nevertheless, there's something very satisfying about playing the
beginning of a game so many times you can destroy it without
mercy.

<div class="entry-content">I recently bought a Dreamcast. The very first game I played was
The Typing of the Dead, but I only played it for a few minutes to
show to Wifey. The very first game I played in depth is <a
Radilgy, a shmup.

The art style is really unique and good looking. The controllers
are quite tight. The weapons are fun. (I really like the lasers
and the bubbles. I play most of the time with the lasers though.)
The shield, sword, and force field are nice touches.

The fourth and fifth levels have these segments that require
spamming the force field over and over and over. (At least, that's
how I do it!) It is pretty insane. Each of the end bosses is
really fun. The mid-level bosses are a little repetitive, because
they have the same core attacks, but they fit well and create a
nice feel for the game. (As I understand from the Wikipedia story,
those are the terrorists and the end bosses are warped
robots.)

My one complaint with the game is that the graphics are so
bright and there is so much flashing that it becomes hard to look
at after a while. I've been playing in 20-ish minute chunks then
doing something else.

I just beat it on Easy with 6 credits and 5 life credits using the
laser. I've been working on a number of different
configurations. I don't like it when shmups have so many options,
because I don't have a good grasp of what the "right" options
are. There is also a big temptation to make it easier, etc. I
wonder, should I try to 1cc it on Easy, then Normal, then Hard? Or
just got right to a different difficulty, etc? I can use 1 credit
to get to the middle of stage 3 (the mini-boss) on Normal. I've
gotten through stages 1 and 2 without ever dying as well. How
should I go about it? I plan on definitely playing for a little
while, but I don't want to make it a permanent pursuit like
/Ikaruga/.

I felt like I didn't have as much use for *REDACTED*lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I'm really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don't think I will for a while.

My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn't beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn't finish the game.

I just finished playing and, man, it is awesome. It recreates the

whole bunch of unique stuff. I was very impressed and

good voice acting in a game that I can think of. The game play is
very fun and removes some of the annoying parts of most RPGs. The
music is great and either touching or exciting, whatever is
appropriate for the context. The graphics are beautiful,
particularly in the final boss battle. And then ending is truly
satisfying.
