    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was young, I played Baseball Stars a lot with my friend
Jeff, so I remembered it as being a great baseball game.</p>

<p>When I just played it last night, I didn't really understand how
to play it. I suppose I should have read the manual, but it was
very non-intuitive and as I got a few innings in to the first game
and started to understand it better, I realized that I would have
liked it to be more RPG-like if I was going to play it alone. I
imagine that playing with another person would have been a good
experience, but by myself it really didn't catch me.</p>
