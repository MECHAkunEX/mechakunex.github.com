    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.</p>

<p>This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn't get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn't get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
<a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=46&amp;gi=6946&amp;vi=7899">2,122,630</a>, but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)</p>

<p>I used lots of save states and I don't think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn't get to level 10.</p>
