    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls &amp; bats. It was cute.</p>

<p>I think I will play it again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon's
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.</p>

<p>In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.</p>

<p>I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn't love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.</p>
