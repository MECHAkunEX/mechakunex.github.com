  <h2>2012</h2>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/21/Game--Castlevania--NES--1986--4/">Game: Castlevania (NES, 1986) (5)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-10-21T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>21</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I decided to beat this game today. I used a cheat code to give
infinite lines, so I didn't need to worry about continues and
replaying sections over and over (at least, until I got passed
them once, or in the case of the stage before a boss battle, more
times.) However, even with that, I was able to get to
Frankenstein's in 3 lives. I took another three to get to stage
15 (the stage that ends in Death.) I did all that in about 30
minutes. I played the stage before Death for about 25 minutes
before church. Then I had a very NES moment and left the system
running while I was at church.

When I got back, I played Death's sequence over and over again
for an hour and a half. Eventually I decided to focus on not
losing any life at all during the hallway with the two axe
knights and the brutal Medusa heads, by willingly sacrificing
lots of hearts. This turned out to be a good move and I gradually
improved. It took maybe three times of getting to Death with full
health before I defeated him. It was awesome.

It only took about 15 minutes to get to Dracula after that. It
took another hour and a half before I beat Dracula. It got to the
point where I could get passed the first form without taking any
damage pretty reliably, but then I had to work on my moves to
fight the second form. Eventually I decided to try the potion
rather than the cross, because the cross didn't seem to do much
damage. This was an awesome move. The potion doesn't do any
damage, but it stunlocks him so he can't move. Provided I didn't
have the double shot, I was able to lay into him for two hits,
then stun, then repeat. I was triumphant!

Altogether, I beat the game in about four hours. It felt so good
to do it. Even though I used a code, it was a pretty weak code
because I had to do everything. It's a good example about what
I'd like games to do---be like spaced repetition systems (like
Anki), have me do a stage until I can beat it reliably, then move
on, but don't show me something that is now easy (or moderate,
but with random swings all the time.)

I'm very glad I gave this game a chance. Initially, the controls
felt so gross, but now I really love their unique stickiness.

<div class="entry-content">I played two times today. The first time for about 45 minutes and
I got to Stage 9. I found it incredibly difficult to get past the
bone pillars... I just couldn't get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.

I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don't like
that I can't restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.

<div class="entry-content">I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult---basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.

The Frankenstein's Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It's similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you're basically toast.

The part I got to, where there's Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it's super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It's a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.

<div class="entry-content">I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls & bats. It was cute.

I think I will play it again.

<div class="entry-content">I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon's
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.

In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.

I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn't love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.
