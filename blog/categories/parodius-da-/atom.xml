    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got to the boss of stage 2 after playing for about 35
minutes. I've heard about this game many times before and I had
much greater expectations about how crazy and silly it would
be. I thought the bosses I fought were very cool, but overall, it
wasn't too crazy.</p>

<p>The mechanics are very reasonable for its time... it's just
Gradius. My only problem with it is that the NES is not a good
system for it: it has really atrocious and not intentional
slow-down; the sprite flicker is really bad and makes it hard to
see enemy bullets; and, the game lacks the vibrancy that it seems
like it should have. I'm also quite spoiler by CAVE when it comes
to being able to distinguish enemy bullets from mine and seeing
the hit box of the character easily.</p>

<p>I will try the other Parodius games rather than invest any more
time in this.</p>
