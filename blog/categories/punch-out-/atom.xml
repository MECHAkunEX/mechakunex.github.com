    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>

<p>Total time: 4:18</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a few rounds today with the kids. I did pretty well
against Sandman... I'm getting better. But I still didn't beat
him.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played before dinner for like 10 minutes. I brought down the
Sandman three times, once per round, but died each of the two
matches. I'm getting better though!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this morning for a little bit... a couple rounds against
Mr. Sandman. I got a few hits in, but don't have a reliable
pattern down. I really let my kids down who were hoping for an
amazing display by Dad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this afternoon for like an hour. I got up to Bald
Bull. During the fight with Soda Popinski that I won, I was in the
second round and had him down twice and he got me down for the
second time... I considered restarting, but didn't and won. Woot!</p>

<p>Later in the day I played for a bit more and got to
Mr. Sandman. He's really really hard. I've decided to put this as
"Scheduled" game and play it weekly until I beat him, rather than
burning a lot of time all at once.</p>

<p>I'm kind of appalled that I was able to get to the end so
quickly, but I know it will take a while to beat Sandman and
online I read that there is another round of fighting every enemy
during Title Defense. So it will be a fun experience, but not
really something you can binge on too much.</p>
