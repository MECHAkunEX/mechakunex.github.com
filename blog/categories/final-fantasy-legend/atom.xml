    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about a half-hour. I was a Human Female,
Human Male, Mutant Female, and Human Male. I sold my Saber, bought
some armor and went out to fight. It took the whole thirty minutes
to be able to afford one more piece of armor. I went out to fight
again and got into a fight with a Red Bull, during the course of
the fight, all my weapons broke and two of my characters died,
then the monster fled, so I didn't get to kill and didn't get any
gold. Now I don't have the money to replace the weapons or revive
the fallen characters. This game seems like it will be nothing
but Kawazu brutalization and grinding. No thank you.</p>
