<div class="entry-content">Hank's relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men---meaning in the government or "public"
sector---namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn't respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus "pure love". The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there's no need for the concept of "love". In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial "trade" and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.

It makes me think of Hayek's comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.

<div class="entry-content">I read the speech by Francisco at James' wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It's like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.

I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don't know that much more than the characters but it's so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn't occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.

<div class="entry-content">I'm now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven't got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I'm just
impervious to thinking they are too long?

Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love's interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I'm kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.

<div class="entry-content">One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough "he said"/"she said" that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as "usability" problems with books.

For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I'm not
totally sure the speakers are correct:

Dagny: "I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be . . . like this. Growing colder and things stopping."

Hank: "I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute."

Dagny: "You did? Funny, I thought that, too."

<div class="entry-content">Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It's a fascinating book. I don't find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be... it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.

It's hard to not compare the book's story to the story of the
movie. I don't know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.

For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It's not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.

In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.

I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are "the
People's state of such-and-such".

In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.

<div class="entry-content">In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
*REDACTED*ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early *REDACTED*ism.

<time datetime="2012-05-14T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>14</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I've been reading this book for a few weeks. It's just
terrible.

It's about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of *REDACTED* and then a series of questions underneath it
like "What does X mean?" "What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?" "What does Y mean?" etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say "follow the
Prophet" and the questions will be something like "What does it
/really/ mean to follow?" "No, REALLY what does it mean?"

I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn't want to
express them clearly because he's afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.

Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he's implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn't actually say this.

In addition to this frivolous questions, there's saccharine
comments like, "Man this Book of *REDACTED* is pretty important, huh? I
can't believe it's so great" that sound like staged humility.

It's plausible that this guy's other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don't think he can use the commentary format effectively.

<div class="entry-content">My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that *could* happen given the way she's set it up.

Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.

<div class="entry-content">I started reading this because Ayame's class in school was. I
greatly enjoy it. The little poems in the first half are so cute
and clever. I'm now in Act III and I don't like it as much, but I
recognize its necessity for the tragedy of the first two Acts to be
realized. I just read Act III/Scene II and it is curious how
casually Juliet talks about having sex with Romeo that night to
seal their marriage.

<div class="entry-content">I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.

My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.

I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
"action", but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That's
what I like most about it... you feel like you are there and they
are real.

I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else's income and how public it is. I don't think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.
