worth commenting on. It's a very interesting book. The Danish and

things. I'm excited about the transition to the Russian world.

<div class="entry-content">This whole chapter seems to be about Marie Taglioni and she sounds
amazing.

If Vestris designed the steps that became modern ballet, she
figured out how to do them with the style expect of modern
ballerinas. She did everything that Vestris did, but she practiced
so long and hard to achieve the strength necessary to do it in an
"elegant" and "feminine" way. While the early dancers were
"sweaty" and "breathless" when they did them, she was
"angelic". She built this technique over 6 months after a failed
start in Vienna by working for 6 hours a day and holding poses for
100 seconds.

Her shoes are still extant and have been studied. While she
performed full pointe, she mainly held herself at full point and
did not dance on it. We know this because her shoes were not the
boxed and hard style that allows that. Instead, by looking at the
wearing at the shoes, it looks like she danced about half-way
between half-pointe and full-pointe. Her dancing was so powerful
that she used 2 or 3 shoes per performance.

<div class="entry-content">I just read one of the most interesting sections so far. It
discussed how in the 1820s, a ballet master named Vestris
dramatically changed the art.

He took the old three different genres of ballet and combined all
their steps into a new genre---that is modern ballet. This had lots
of big consequences. The old notation systems didn't work any
longer and weren't replaced because of the complexity of the new
dances.

The old style of practice was forgotten and replaced. Before, whole
dances were done continuously for practice, but after individual
steps were repeated dozens of times before going on to more
steps. The various steps were ranked in order of difficulty. For
example, in Vestris' notes it says there were 27 different kinds
of pirouettes. 

In particular, the role of the male dancer changed a lot. Vestris
innovated the male dancer as acrobat doing many jumps and
turns. This was seen as very wild and distasteful. In addition,
the new style he came up with was perfected by women, so part of
his innovation led to male dancers becoming pariahs and not a
major part of ballet. In fact, in the mid 1800s, many male roles
were played by women! This is funny to me because a hundred years
before, the opposite was true.

<div class="entry-content">It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like "plays" but
should be like "paintings", because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can't express detailed, dynamic
stories... everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable... like a painting.

<div class="entry-content">I read most of the first chapter today, although I decided it was
a bit long and I should break my reading into smaller chunks. It
was very interesting to read about the philosophical origins of
the art. The idea that entertainment before was more loud and that
ballet was distinguished by silence is cool. The Feuillet notation
is crazy to read... it looks so meaningless to me. The debate
about whether dance should be considered part of music is curious,
especially given modern university organization. Finally, reading
about all the ways male dance was preferred to female dance is
very strange to a modern, such as myself.

<div class="entry-content">I read the introduction today. I was very interested to learn that
the current ballet canon is very Russian, but made by a French guy,
and very late in the life of ballet. The concept of there being
very little data about the past of ballet is curious. I like the
idea that the story of this book will focus on the steps and forms
themselves. It seems like a style I would be most intrigued by.

book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple

<div class="entry-content">My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)

After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they've been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.

Pointed comments:

- (pg 5) "We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've
uncovered."

This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren't "conscientious" enough and even then
they say "almost any" and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don't make very
large claims.

- (pg 7) One of the "companies" we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a "Great"
company. I should throw the book out right now.

Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.

- (pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a "humble" leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.

Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.

Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.

Snow's conversation with Katniss: very believable.

Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?

Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.

<div class="entry-content">I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.

The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.

The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I'm glad that the characters realize this
too.

It's funny because when she's in the field, it's like she's in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.

The real moment of Katniss' catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.

The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.

I find the term "Mockingjay" used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.

Katniss' impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)

I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.

I'm stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol... tense!

<div class="entry-content">The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.

I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.

I can't imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there's no doubt about
that, but I'm not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.

<div class="entry-content">The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.

The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It's as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn't possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.

I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.

I teared up in the District 11 scene.

Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?

It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.

Haymitch's story is great.

The amount of "food porn" in the books never gets old, strangely.

Katniss' private session with the Gamemakers :)

The pre-Games interviews were amazing.

The end of Part II is waaaay intense.

I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss' body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she'll say she's "naked" or talk about
her "breasts" and most often she mentions her "underwear",
"underclothes", or "undergarment". It's particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we're so often given.

The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.

<div class="entry-content">I'm disappointed the movie didn't use the plot-point about the
"traitor" that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It's a cool
idea.

I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile... I can't imagine the audience really being excited about
it.

Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It's very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn't as touching.

<div class="entry-content">I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.

I find it very strange that if the Capitol is "surrounded" by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia... i.e. very far away... how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.

Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.

<div class="entry-content">I just finished the book. I thought the ending was very exciting
but a little bit disappointing because we don't find out what the
feels are of all the "bad guys" who gave up---like Ferris, etc. The
attitudes of the guards was very interesting. The very ending when
they are planning the rebuilding is cool. However, it's unclear why
they think they'll be able to prevent the same thing from
happening... there's a little bit alluded to with the revision of
the Constitution. I think I would have liked a little bit more of a
vision of Utopia. Overall, it was definitely a masterpiece.

<div class="entry-content">Hank's relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men---meaning in the government or "public"
sector---namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn't respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus "pure love". The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there's no need for the concept of "love". In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial "trade" and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.

It makes me think of Hayek's comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.

<div class="entry-content">I read the speech by Francisco at James' wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It's like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.

I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don't know that much more than the characters but it's so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn't occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.

<div class="entry-content">I'm now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven't got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I'm just
impervious to thinking they are too long?

Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love's interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I'm kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.

<div class="entry-content">One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough "he said"/"she said" that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as "usability" problems with books.

For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I'm not
totally sure the speakers are correct:

Dagny: "I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be . . . like this. Growing colder and things stopping."

Hank: "I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute."

Dagny: "You did? Funny, I thought that, too."

<div class="entry-content">Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It's a fascinating book. I don't find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be... it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.

It's hard to not compare the book's story to the story of the
movie. I don't know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.

For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It's not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.

In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.

I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are "the
People's state of such-and-such".

In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.

<div class="entry-content">In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
*REDACTED*ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early *REDACTED*ism.

<div class="entry-content">I've been reading this book for a few weeks. It's just
terrible.

It's about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of *REDACTED* and then a series of questions underneath it
like "What does X mean?" "What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?" "What does Y mean?" etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say "follow the
Prophet" and the questions will be something like "What does it
/really/ mean to follow?" "No, REALLY what does it mean?"

I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn't want to
express them clearly because he's afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.

Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he's implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn't actually say this.

In addition to this frivolous questions, there's saccharine
comments like, "Man this Book of *REDACTED* is pretty important, huh? I
can't believe it's so great" that sound like staged humility.

It's plausible that this guy's other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don't think he can use the commentary format effectively.

<div class="entry-content">My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that *could* happen given the way she's set it up.

Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.

<div class="entry-content">I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.

My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.

I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
"action", but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That's
what I like most about it... you feel like you are there and they
are real.

I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else's income and how public it is. I don't think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.
