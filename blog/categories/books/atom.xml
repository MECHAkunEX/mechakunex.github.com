    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like "plays" but
should be like "paintings", because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can't express detailed, dynamic
stories... everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable... like a painting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The section I read today had an interesting part about how so many
early French ballerinas became courtesans and changed ballet to be
far more feminine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the first chapter today. It closes in an interesting
way... pointing out that by the end of Louis XIV's reign ballet
was established independently from the king and court but had
retained in its DNA that upbringing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read most of the first chapter today, although I decided it was
a bit long and I should break my reading into smaller chunks. It
was very interesting to read about the philosophical origins of
the art. The idea that entertainment before was more loud and that
ballet was distinguished by silence is cool. The Feuillet notation
is crazy to read... it looks so meaningless to me. The debate
about whether dance should be considered part of music is curious,
especially given modern university organization. Finally, reading
about all the ways male dance was preferred to female dance is
very strange to a modern, such as myself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the introduction today. I was very interested to learn that
the current ballet canon is very Russian, but made by a French guy,
and very late in the life of ballet. The concept of there being
very little data about the past of ballet is curious. I like the
idea that the story of this book will focus on the steps and forms
themselves. It seems like a style I would be most intrigued by.</p>
