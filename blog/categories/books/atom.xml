    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been reading this book for a few weeks. It's just
terrible.</p>

<p>It's about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of <em>REDACTED</em> and then a series of questions underneath it
like "What does X mean?" "What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?" "What does Y mean?" etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say "follow the
Prophet" and the questions will be something like "What does it
/really/ mean to follow?" "No, REALLY what does it mean?"</p>

<p>I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn't want to
express them clearly because he's afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.</p>

<p>Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he's implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn't actually say this.</p>

<p>In addition to this frivolous questions, there's saccharine
comments like, "Man this Book of <em>REDACTED</em> is pretty important, huh? I
can't believe it's so great" that sound like staged humility.</p>

<p>It's plausible that this guy's other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don't think he can use the commentary format effectively.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife read this book for book group (I think that's why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn't
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn't slicey enough because there
aren't even interesting vignettes about the girl's life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen... and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That's pretty bad. It's not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it's
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there's basically
only one thing that <em>could</em> happen given the way she's set it up.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn't
for me.</p>

memorable to me, but the last verse is very beautiful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started reading this because Ayame's class in school was. I
greatly enjoy it. The little poems in the first half are so cute
and clever. I'm now in Act III and I don't like it as much, but I
recognize its necessity for the tragedy of the first two Acts to be
realized. I just read Act III/Scene II and it is curious how
casually Juliet talks about having sex with Romeo that night to
seal their marriage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.</p>

<p>My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.</p>

<p>I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
"action", but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That's
what I like most about it... you feel like you are there and they
are real.</p>

<p>I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else's income and how public it is. I don't think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.</p>
