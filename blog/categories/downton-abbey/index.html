<div class="entry-content">This was an amazing episode. I love that it was so happy and so
many wonderful things happened. I feel like Daisy and Mary really
deserve their happiness. I like the way things happened with each
of them. The grandma was in ripe form this episode too. Classic.

<div class="entry-content">This was an awesome episode. Lots of very exciting things
happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT
episode. Lord Grantham's kiss was ridiculously out of place in my
opinion.

<div class="entry-content">This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.

<div class="entry-content">Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.

Ethel.

<div class="entry-content">This was a fascinating episode. I find Mrs. Crawley to be really
annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I'm proud of
Edith too, she's been very nice.

<div class="entry-content">The drama is on very quickly. I don't like the idea of them using
the house for more to do with the war. I like the way its about
almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I'm appalled by Edith cheating
with a farmer.

<div class="entry-content">I'm kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O'Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary's backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it's more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I'm still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I'm very curious
how the next season will go, because they've been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really intense episode. I really enjoyed the cuteness
between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years... at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.

a crescendo when all these things---Thomas, the Turk, etc---will
all come crashing down. Seven episodes is a very short season.

<div class="entry-content">This episode was appalling! I can't believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?

<div class="entry-content">This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew's distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.

<div class="entry-content">I've been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.

The first episode was very cool. They've laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.
