<div class="entry-content">I'm glad Thomas is okay by the end. I thought the sub-plot of
Rose was really great. I like it because it really sets up a big
contrast between Rose (who is wild) and Edith (who is not) but
both are pursued by married men. In addition, Rose is a bit of a
stand-in for Mary at the beginning of the show, when she did
things that Edith would not approve of. Mary's comment on the
sixth episode was very striking, that she doubts that Edith and
she would get along any better. She's very realist.

It's nice that three men in the show are getting on. It will be
interesting to plot that part of the history of Downton.

<div class="entry-content">Mrs. Patmore says something so funny to the young people:
"You're all in love with wrong people!" I was also very
interested in the idea of Daisy leaving and taking charge. I
like her a lot.

Thomas is a very interesting character: he can be very wicked,
but he's also extremely sympathetic to modern mores that resent
the prejudice he receives.

<div class="entry-content">This was a very interesting episode. I think the issues about the
management of the estate are very interesting, and I'm glad they
will get coverage. It's very sad about Sybil, but I never really
loved her character anyways. The old ways of medicine are funny.

<div class="entry-content">Although technically just a month later, it feels like there is a
big gap between this episode and the last. It is interesting the
way they've driven the family back together, solved a few
problems, and created more. There's a very fluid flow to the
show, where there are many balls in the air that get caught at
regular rates, but just as new ones go up. I'm most curious about
the Matthew and Edith plot lines.

the money will be coming in, they're be saved, but there is
mounting drama downstairs, with Mr. Bates, and with
Ethel. Exciting!

<div class="entry-content">We just noticed that the next season was released in the
UK. This was a fun episode to get back with everyone again. I'm
glad that they've evolved the challenge to be more than just
Mary and Matthew fighting. It seems like the new challenge will
be this money problem and it will last through the whole
season. Obviously I have no clue, but they've actually got a
reliable problem to lean on.

opinion.

<div class="entry-content">This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.

<div class="entry-content">Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.

annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I'm proud of

almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I'm appalled by Edith cheating

<div class="entry-content">I'm kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O'Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary's backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it's more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I'm still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I'm very curious
how the next season will go, because they've been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.

mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the

really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?

<div class="entry-content">I've been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.

The first episode was very cool. They've laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.
