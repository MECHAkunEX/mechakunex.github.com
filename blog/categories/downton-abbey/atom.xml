    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm glad Thomas is okay by the end. I thought the sub-plot of
Rose was really great. I like it because it really sets up a big
contrast between Rose (who is wild) and Edith (who is not) but
both are pursued by married men. In addition, Rose is a bit of a
stand-in for Mary at the beginning of the show, when she did
things that Edith would not approve of. Mary's comment on the
sixth episode was very striking, that she doubts that Edith and
she would get along any better. She's very realist.</p>

<p>It's nice that three men in the show are getting on. It will be
interesting to plot that part of the history of Downton.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mrs. Patmore says something so funny to the young people:
"You're all in love with wrong people!" I was also very
interested in the idea of Daisy leaving and taking charge. I
like her a lot.</p>

<p>Thomas is a very interesting character: he can be very wicked,
but he's also extremely sympathetic to modern mores that resent
the prejudice he receives.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's exciting to see Violet plotting and I like it when she uses
her powers for good. I think Mr. Carson is so funny the way he is
more pompous than the nobles in his observance of tradition.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very interesting episode. I think the issues about the
management of the estate are very interesting, and I'm glad they
will get coverage. It's very sad about Sybil, but I never really
loved her character anyways. The old ways of medicine are funny.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although technically just a month later, it feels like there is a
big gap between this episode and the last. It is interesting the
way they've driven the family back together, solved a few
problems, and created more. There's a very fluid flow to the
show, where there are many balls in the air that get caught at
regular rates, but just as new ones go up. I'm most curious about
the Matthew and Edith plot lines.</p>
