    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O'Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary's backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it's more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I'm still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I'm very curious
how the next season will go, because they've been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really intense episode. I really enjoyed the cuteness
between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years... at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another fascinating episode. I feel like it is really building to
a crescendo when all these things---Thomas, the Turk, etc---will
all come crashing down. Seven episodes is a very short season.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a simple and nice episode that just developed the
interaction between the characters. Some of plot
lines---feminism, the thief, etc---are clearly foreshadowing of
greater events.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode was appalling! I can't believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?</p>
