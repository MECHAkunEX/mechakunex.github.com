    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They've laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>
