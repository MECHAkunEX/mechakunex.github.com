    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a pretty touching episode as we see more of Mary's
feelings for Matthew. It was quite enjoyable. I'm appalled by
Ethel.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fascinating episode. I find Mrs. Crawley to be really
annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I'm proud of
Edith too, she's been very nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The drama is on very quickly. I don't like the idea of them using
the house for more to do with the war. I like the way its about
almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I'm appalled by Edith cheating
with a farmer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very powerful episode and a great start for a new
season. I found the White Feather scene and what went on with
Thomas to be very interesting.</p>
