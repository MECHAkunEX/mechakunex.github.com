    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode was appalling! I can't believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk's death?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew's distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They've laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>
