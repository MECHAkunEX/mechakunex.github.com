    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although technically just a month later, it feels like there is a
big gap between this episode and the last. It is interesting the
way they've driven the family back together, solved a few
problems, and created more. There's a very fluid flow to the
show, where there are many balls in the air that get caught at
regular rates, but just as new ones go up. I'm most curious about
the Matthew and Edith plot lines.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting episode with a lot of drama. Now that
the money will be coming in, they're be saved, but there is
mounting drama downstairs, with Mr. Bates, and with
Ethel. Exciting!</p>

characters really sink in deeply. I like it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just noticed that the next season was released in the
UK. This was a fun episode to get back with everyone again. I'm
glad that they've evolved the challenge to be more than just
Mary and Matthew fighting. It seems like the new challenge will
be this money problem and it will last through the whole
season. Obviously I have no clue, but they've actually got a
reliable problem to lean on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an amazing episode. I love that it was so happy and so
many wonderful things happened. I feel like Daisy and Mary really
deserve their happiness. I like the way things happened with each
of them. The grandma was in ripe form this episode too. Classic.</p>
