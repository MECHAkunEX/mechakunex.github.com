    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just noticed that the next season was released in the
UK. This was a fun episode to get back with everyone again. I'm
glad that they've evolved the challenge to be more than just
Mary and Matthew fighting. It seems like the new challenge will
be this money problem and it will last through the whole
season. Obviously I have no clue, but they've actually got a
reliable problem to lean on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an amazing episode. I love that it was so happy and so
many wonderful things happened. I feel like Daisy and Mary really
deserve their happiness. I like the way things happened with each
of them. The grandma was in ripe form this episode too. Classic.</p>

a few good things in this show.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an awesome episode. Lots of very exciting things
happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT
episode. Lord Grantham's kiss was ridiculously out of place in my
opinion.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.</p>
