    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an awesome episode. Lots of very exciting things
happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT
episode.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O'Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew... more craziness comes along.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary's adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it's now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn't
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a pretty touching episode as we see more of Mary's
feelings for Matthew. It was quite enjoyable. I'm appalled by
Ethel.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fascinating episode. I find Mrs. Crawley to be really
annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I'm proud of
Edith too, she's been very nice.</p>
