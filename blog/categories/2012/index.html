<h1><a href="/blog/2012/08/18/Movie--The-Lorax--by-Dr--Seuss--2012--0/">Movie: The Lorax, by Dr. Seuss (2012)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-08-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn't see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.

The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he's a bad businessman because he doesn't have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O'Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.

I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There's this
text:

David Edelstein: "the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk" -- and
[in the movie] Ted says, "Wow, what does that even mean?" and
Audrey says, "I know, right?" So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss' sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth."

What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don't know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren't making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!

too. It was rad. The funny digs were neat too.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/08/11/Movie--The-Dark-Knight-Rises--directed-by-Christopher-Nolan--2012--0/">Movie: The Dark Knight Rises, directed by Christopher Nolan (2012)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot... it made it more
dramatic. It's also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I'm glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.

My only complaint is that Bane's voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments... it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can't have in a theatre.

Despite Nolan's insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.

<div class="entry-content">This was a fun, fast-paced action movie. I liked how the world of
the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.

<div class="entry-content">This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren't totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren't really
super heroes... more "super spys" and that didn't seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character... the actor played him too "cool" and above-it-all.

There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, "Ma'am, there's only one God, and I don't
think He dresses like that." Not only was it delivered really well,
but it's such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.

Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.

<div class="entry-content">I had heard a little about this movie when it came out, but nothing
really special. My parents wanted to watch a movie together and I
saw this on Amazon and suggested it.

I really enjoyed the movie. It's very much unlike anything else in
its grand scheme. Maybe a little bit like Stargate. It takes a
little while to get started, but once it does, the pay-off is
great. I think what I like most about it is the way it spins a
world so well.

It makes me very interested in reading the series of books.

<div class="entry-content">I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.

I'm not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.

I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren't
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She's got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.

I quite like the development of Pete's understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.

I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter's
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.

I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/06/20/Movie--This-Means-War--starring-Reese-Witherspoon--2012--0/">Movie: This Means War, starring Reese Witherspoon (2012)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-06-20T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This is a totally over the top movie. It's silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.

There are some funny moments and characters---like the way the CIA
teams act on the "case" and Lauren's friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the "super fast" type without much impact.

There a few moments of real romance---when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he's watching Titantic and the look on Tuck's ex-wife's face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there's no meaning
behind their actions.

But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren't really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she's doesn't look at Lauren
enough when they're talking... it's very unnatural.)

Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she's trying too hard to look
sexy... particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other... it's like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.

<div class="entry-content">This was a very cute movie. There were a lot of cute moments. I
felt like the people in it were unrealistically mean to basically
everyone. I read the Wikipedia page and it talked about the real
couple was very religious and credit God for keeping them
together. It would have been nice to acknowledge that it
someway... but the couple in the movie weren't even married in a
church.

I think my favourite parts of the movie were the very subtle signs
of how much they loved each other. Such as rolling up the window
and the cat. Very cute.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/05/04/Movie--Underworld--Awakening--starring-Kate-Beckinsale--2012--0/">Movie: Underworld: Awakening, starring Kate Beckinsale (2012)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-05-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It's
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It's spectacular.

The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don't really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.

The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don't mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn't receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.

I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don't
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.

The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn't get
from the movie. For example, the daughter's name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.

<div class="entry-content">I saw this on opening day, because my wife was going with some
friends and someone fell through, so I took the last ticket. I have
never read the books, so I don't really have opinions or
predilections about it. I thought the world was neat. They did a
good job showing the opulence of the people in the capitol, but I
don't think they really made the oppression disgusting enough. The
action was fun and she was pretty heroic---I found myself tearing
up a few times. I find the world to be pretty unbelievable
though. I don't understand how the people in the capitol could be
supportive of the oppression, when they don't seem to be kept in
the dark or otherwise "brainwashed" into thinking that they are
doing great things for the districts. Similarly, I don't understand
why they would not take better care of the districts or why the
districts would not have already gone on strike. The idea that this
could go on for 74 years strains credulity. I don't think Katniss
is a very consistent character. The movie communicated to me that
she was all about doing the right thing and would rather die than
not do that; yet, she doesn't do a whole lot against "the man". For
example, when she talks to Peter at night before the games start,
he says he wants to show that he is not "owned" and she agrees, but
says she'd like to go home. The way this scene plays out and how
she is so non-aggressive during the games said to me that she
really agreed with him. Yet, she never actually does anything to go
against them. Dying together at the end is a little bit like that,
but you get the impression that she knew they wouldn't let her do
it, and therefore it was an empty calculation rather than a
confident objection. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I
felt like it could be more. My wife says that it is part one of a
trilogy and my wishes will come true in some way in the
future. That's fine... but... it's annoying when you need to know
something about the real world to appreciate a movie... when it
can't satisfy you on its own.

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml) - I like the review.

satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won't get
you that.

[Christian Nutt in Gamasutra](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php) - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn't need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?

[2D-X Diaries](http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/) - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks
like Samus (and has ridiculous hot pants.)

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/02/27/Game--Final-Fantasy-13-2--PS3--2012--23/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 2 (PS3, 2012) - Review/Summary</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-02-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Now that I've beat the game and 100%'d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect---there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor---a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.

FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem---the UI is much better in ways you wouldn't
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun & diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
"mechanics", much better, in fact.

There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the "drive" of the
characters---escape---consumes all story bandwidth.

But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn't even re-use every environment and there didn't seem to
be very much from the "whole game of content" that was cut
from 13.

However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don't think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn't feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.

This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn't pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content---the super hard bosses, like FF13's missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.

In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13's 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.

Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.

Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope---other than To Be Continued---that would've
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.

Overall, I'm glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I'm not sure I'd
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I'd hope for a bit more
improvements.

I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.

<div class="entry-content">I play this a bit pretty much every time I got to the
bathroom. I'm stuck at a pretty standard score---I can get to the
first few red enemies. I still feel like the game's control would
be so much better with real buttons, etc. I've noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. [This interesting review](http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/) has some

<div class="entry-content">Today I am looking for more monsters... on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I'll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy---I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I'm kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don't want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I'll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It's weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn't see any extra scene... will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits... that's it... so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there's no harder monsters to challenge, so it's like it isn't
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn't acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]

the Long Gui on the second try with 2 staggers and 5 stars. Beat
Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the "last time on
FF13-2", it shows Lightning saying "It's up to you to keep hope
alive". It was "It's up to you to keep Hope alive", then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn't on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content">Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There's a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool---especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the "real/good" ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. "The Future
is Hope" ending is strange because it seems like the "true"
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good---but it's very anti-climatic... although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: "A new adventure was just beginning---the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!" Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough... it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn't feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn't been any explanation given of why Snow is a l'Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower--The A.Z Files---reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
that can be done in the game still. [050:43:10 Frags 157/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content">I found another random fragment in New Bodhum 700 AF. I find it
very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem
totally hidden... like I can't really find them until something in
the game changes... like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don't like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh's appearance is pretty funny. Hope's
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn't get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can't make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) -- bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can't just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah's earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending... Lightning on
the goddess Etro's throne looked wicked cool though. "To Be
Continued"? FF13-3? Or just one of the other endings? I don't
understand what the Paradox Scope will do... should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each
gate that has free fragments. [036:33:45 Frags 102/160 Lvl 418]

<div class="entry-content">Exploring 100 AF Bresha Ruins. This has been like one of two so
far missions where you have to travel to the
past/future. Actually, I've got to jump around quite a
bit. Something I'm not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I've been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM... the hover doesn't seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting... Mog is so funny in his
opinions about humans. :) I'm running the slot machines on auto
and got three ochu! But I then lost everything in Super Victory
Mode, so I didn't keep the save. [033:45:14 Frags 99/160 Lvl 369]

<div class="entry-content">It is kind of crazy to go through the same areas like 4 times. The
fact that there is kind of a "hidden object" game inside this game
is strange when you reflect on it. I love my clock solver. The
dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine---would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn't;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius' life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I've been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They've firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn't win him as a monster? I tried Lightning & Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight's stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I'll be put into the
end game. [030:49:01 Frags 83/160 Lvl 337]

<div class="entry-content">They do a really good job communicating Serah's changing feelings
about her task... from meeting Lightning to saving the future. It
is getting hard to keep track of what episode I am in. I think I
found the Casino (mini games!) and a place that will lead to
Lightning at the end of the game. Some of these assets are clearly
re-used, because they are places from FF13, but they look so
different, I don't see how this is any cheaper to make than a new
game. The Moogle Toss system is funny. It has just hit me that the
Preemptive Strike bonus is a lot weaker in this game: just about
half staggered and Haste. I got to Serendipity for the first
time... Chocobo races!!! The Proto fal'Cie in Academia are
crazy. The Academia part is really annoying because you are
overwhelmed with monsters, but they don't give any gil or CP. I
just noticed you can get 6 digits of HP. I intend to go to the
fragment reward place every day. I decided to keep track of my
levels differently, by adding them up because I won't go past 60
for a while. That also means that I won't need to keep two
numbers, since they will be the same. I made a mistake when I
expanded Serah's Crystarium. I maxed out my two main roles and
should have gotten another role, but instead expanded my
accessories. Oh well. It is so tempting to not read about some of
the mechanical details... like how many levels you can get
(presumably 99 in each?) what the fragment skills are,
etc. [014:06:26 Frags 21/160 Lvl 168]

<div class="entry-content">I've been using a lot of Phoenix Downs since I got to the Yassaf
Machif (?). Seems like a bad thing. It's pretty crazy to see Hope
as an older dude. I accidentally closed the Bresha gate and had to
redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It's pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won't do that good thing and you'll
drastically change what they did---probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]

<div class="entry-content">Omega wrecked me. The video opening sequence is pretty cool. The
time anomalies are cute little puzzles. My strategy is to have
Serah be primarily Ravager and Noel primarily Commando. Their
primary role is N, their secondary is N/2, and their others is
N/4. All the monsters are at level N/4 as well. I don't know if
this is a very good strategy. I am slightly worried that it won't
be possible to max out every level, but then I realized that the
level on the status screen is just the maximum level of any
role... I think at least. [004:56:03 (31/28) (8/160)]

<div class="entry-content">The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there's
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different... a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control... like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you'll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I'm glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can't tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03
