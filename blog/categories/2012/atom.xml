    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My mom recommended this movie to us, as she has been reading the
series it is based on for a long time. I found the movie charming
and cute. It was a nice light mystery with some subtle romantic and
funny moments. It makes me interested in the books.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.</p>

<p>I'm not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.</p>

<p>I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren't
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She's got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.</p>

<p>I quite like the development of Pete's understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.</p>

<p>I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter's
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a totally over the top movie. It's silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some funny moments and characters---like the way the CIA
teams act on the "case" and Lauren's friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the "super fast" type without much impact.</p>

<p>There a few moments of real romance---when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he's watching Titantic and the look on Tuck's ex-wife's face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there's no meaning
behind their actions.</p>

<p>But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren't really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she's doesn't look at Lauren
enough when they're talking... it's very unnatural.)</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she's trying too hard to look
sexy... particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other... it's like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very cute movie. There were a lot of cute moments. I
felt like the people in it were unrealistically mean to basically
everyone. I read the Wikipedia page and it talked about the real
couple was very religious and credit God for keeping them
together. It would have been nice to acknowledge that it
someway... but the couple in the movie weren't even married in a
church.</p>

<p>I think my favourite parts of the movie were the very subtle signs
of how much they loved each other. Such as rolling up the window
and the cat. Very cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It's
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It's spectacular.</p>

<p>The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don't really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.</p>

<p>The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don't mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn't receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don't
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn't get
from the movie. For example, the daughter's name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.</p>
