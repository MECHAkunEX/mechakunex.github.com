    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a brilliant movie. All the cameos, references, and jokes
related to video games were lots of fun. The story was pretty cute
too. I saw it with my two kids and they enjoyed it a lot. I liked
the music a lot, especially the AKB48 song.</p>

<p>The short at the beginning of the movie was beautiful and made me
cry. =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I played this for about ten minutes today. It's a
very cute and kind of brilliant concept. I thought the names of
the stuff were great. We gave up after eight sectors because our
kids were getting upset at us yelling at each other. :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw this movie advertised at the beginning of another and it
seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren't even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn't utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.</p>
