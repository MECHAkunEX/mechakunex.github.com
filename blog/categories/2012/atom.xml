    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and half this morning. I got stars in every
beginner event. I did 1-5 as Chang and I beat Isabella in Sudden
Death on the third hole. It was very intense. Also, in 1-5 I got
a crown. I haven't figured out how to find out what will give you
a crown though. Everything seemed a lot easier with Change
because he had so much power, but it also seems like the
characters aren't really supposed to be better than one-another,
but just represent different play styles. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played all night while chatting and burping my
new baby. I got stars up to 3-4 and did the Pro VS match twice. In
the first one, I lost after just a few holes and in the second I
had her tied until the second to last hole, then lost by one
stroke in the last. Ouch. It's a very fun game. But I might be
playing too much :/</p>

<p>Total time: 9:01</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for two and three quarter hours. I got stars in
1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. The game is very fun and I like the abstract
way it presents golf. I feel like I know nothing about golf, but
that I can do the game pretty well and have fun. One thing I
don't like though is that golf punishes mistakes soooo
heavily. Basically one mistake can cause you to get two or three
strokes behind and then you'll never get back. I went from being
1st in 1-4 to 13th in one hole and then ended in 19th because I
made another single mistake. It is brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like two hours tonight. The "gameplay loop" of this
game is very repetitive. I feel like my use of the fighting system
is so boring, but so effective too that it doesn't matter. I still
like the feeling of flying through the air though. I feel like
that game is too long and I've already played it for so long. I
had a lot of frustrating times tonight when I needed to swing the
camera fast and couldn't.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really cute movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing. Taylor
Schilling is super beautiful. Zac was great in the movie, but I
think he looks too young for the part, even with
scruffiness. Something neat about Sparks is that his movies always
work, but as movies, there's nothing really special about
them. Interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad... my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>
