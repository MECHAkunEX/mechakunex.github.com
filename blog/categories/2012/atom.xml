    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw this movie advertised at the beginning of another and it
seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren't even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn't utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I used Amy exclusively and
beat the third challenge. I did really good on the third full
course tournament... until the 13th hole when I went from first to
last place by the end. Ouch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I saw this tonight [which is why I wanted to write down
my thoughts about the other ones.] I found a lot about this movie a
lot better than QoS. I thought the movie was paced a lot better and
the new characters were quite interesting. On the other hand, there
wasn't really an deep connections. Even the deepest connection
(between M and 007) wasn't developed much. In addition, the goal of
the villain wasn't at a very big scale. He was almost Bane or
Joker-ish in his abilities, but had a trivial revenge scheme
planned. There were lots of holes and missed opportunities---why
not just blow up MI6 when M was there if he wanted to kill her so
bad? Why was Severine with the guy getting killed? Why would
Patrice be necessarily working for the same guy twice? Severine's
death was totally ignored and Bond doesn't even acknowledge it
happens. The island is a wasted set. The best parts are the
committee hearing and the showdown at Skyfall.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about half an hour and did 3-5. I ended in 4th place
on Easy. The game is getting hard. I wonder if Pancho is just not
a good character because of his bad control?</p>
