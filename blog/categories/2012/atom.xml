    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad... my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really cool movie. The effects were awesome and the
embellishments of the story, particularly the relationship of the
Evil Queen and her brother, were really cool. Kristen Stewart was
beautiful in it and played the part very well. I thought she was
awkward fighting, but feel like it was purposeful. Definitely a
fun movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn't do
any of the combat ones. I'm really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I'm moving it away from myself. It's
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the "stealth" mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the "recharging" missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying... I feel like I'm Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don't feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I'm pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren't precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I'll probably get used to it as I play. It's a fun little
game... definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn't have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the game tonight in about an hour. I did the Miasma
Cave, the last Arena season, and the fight against Therius. It was
a very sweet ending. Overall, I think this is one of the strongest
stories out of an RPG I've played. The ending is a little bit
tropey, but not incredibly and it really justifies the things that
are tropes. I was really affected by the relationship between Zael
and Calista. It felt as real as a movie. I really loved this
game. The combat system was really fun and challenging. I think
the next time I play I'll try not to get too powerful so the game
is a bit more challenging... but it was still good
anyways. Mistwalker keeps getting better and better.</p>
