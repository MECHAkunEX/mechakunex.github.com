    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours tonight. I have a few thoughts
about my experiences tonight...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The controls are really annoying. It is very weird that A is
the confirm button on the Wii Pro controller, because it is in
the cancel spot. There should have been a way to change.</p></li>
<li><p>The user interface is really painful. There's a big loading
time to do everything. The equipment management system is
really annoying---you can't equip from a shop and when you
change equipment, the gems don't automatically get unequipped
and I haven't found a way to remove them other than putting the
thing back on and removing it from there. It's really
painful. The quick travel system is really slow too because you
have to go so deep in the menus.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm amazed that the killed off what seemed like a main
character after giving you the opportunity to spend /a lot/ of
money on her to give a special bikini outfit. I didn't realize
it would be a wasted expense.</p></li>
<li><p>The graphics are quite good for some Wii games, but feel really
bad in other ways. I think this is most noticeable when they
show faces, because they are totally flat. The environments are
really beautifully constructed and I love how open they are.</p></li>
<li><p>The combat system is pretty interesting. I still don't feel
like I totally understand all my choices, but I have a bit of a
technique worked out that is being useful so far.</p></li>
<li><p>The story is pretty compelling and the world is very bizarre
and fascinating for it.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had this game on my "Queue" since I bought it, but I've had
to admit to myself that I just hate playing games on the iPhone
so much, I'm definitely not going to sit down and play
this. Sometimes I play it when I'm waiting for something, but I
have other things that feel more productive that I could be doing
on my phone.</p>

<p>I like the game and I think it is the best iPhone game I've
played, but I really dislike the iPhone interface and this game
in particular feels like it would work just as well with
buttons. I feel like the only way for me to appreciate this game
will be for me to re-implement it myself and give it buttons.</p>

<p>So, I'm retiring it from my queue, with a bit of a sad face.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started this game tonight. The opening sequence is really cool,
especially after the battle when it pulls out and shows you how
people live on the two giant titans. It's such a cool concept.</p>

<p>The battle system I experienced during the walk to the first
village was incredibly reminiscent of FF12, but with a bit more
action on the part of the player. When I got to the town, it was
incredibly tempting to go and find all the glowing blue things
and get all the quests, etc. I can tell that it will be hard to
not make this game a giant collect-a-thon for myself.</p>

<p>I'm finding the mechanics a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of
different options about how to equip characters, so many quests,
so many different ways to buy things. It's very intimidating. I
think I will do the obvious thing until it hurts me rather than
trying to compute what the best solution will be.</p>

<p>I was amazed at how many different quests I unlocked so early,
though.</p>

<p>The voice acting in this game is actually really good. I almost
never like non-Japanese voice acting, because it is normally just
so horrendous. (Actually, now that I think about, Asura's Wrath
was pretty good.) Since the actors in this game are British,
there's something really fun and exotic about them. I like it.</p>

<p>I'm pretty excited to be playing this game. (One annoyance: I'm
using the Wii Pro controller. I hate having to have it plugged in
to the Wiimote that sits stupidly next to me on the couch.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours this afternoon. I beat the normal
game, but I got a message about a hidden episode that requires a
certain score to play through. I'm interested in the story and I
feel duty bound to get this score myself, rather than just watch
it online. (Whereas I will watch the "True" Ending that is DLC
because that's ridiculous.) I'll probably get the chance to do it
later today.</p>

<p>The normal ending is crazy. The "Tarantula" earth is ridiculous. I
love that there is a title screen on the last episode of the
game. I love the crazy million exploding arms thing. The battle
with the Vlitra Core was horrific. It is incredibly hard to dodge
in this game because the frame rate will get really choppy and
then things start teleporting around. The worst thing about the
fight was that the two QTE counter-attacks would change the
prompt seemingly randomly so you couldn't really be prepared for
what it would be. Argh.</p>

<p>I thought that Yasha's voice actor sounded like York from Deadly
Premonition, but my wife disagreed... and she was right. As usual.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Later in the day I tried to starting doing the S Ranks to get the
true ending. I redid level 13, did really well, but didn't get an
S. This made me decide it wasn't worth it to play the game
continuously to earn the S. Instead, I watched it on YouTube and
then started watching the DLC.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>In the extended ending DLC, the Demigods-are-Robots hypothesis
got a lot of strength, because Asura's chest is opened and a new
"reactor" is put inside.</p>

<p>The space fight with the True Boss is ridiculous. Asura grows
larger than the Earth, but it is still huge. At one point, it
seems to be launching stars at Asura.</p>

<p>The ending comic sequence is nuts too. Chun-Li was in it! I love
the ridiculous time lengths... 670 million years later.</p>

<p>The Street Fighter DLC was pretty crazy too. I liked how meta it
was... Asura entering Ryu's game and then Ryu entering Asura's
game. And I loved that Akuma and Asura fought for 500 years
straight. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Overall, I'd say Asura's Wrath was a fun experience. The anime
aspect of it was really great and I think the QTEs do a good job
at making that experience more tense because you're at the edge
of your seat. I never failed during a QTE sequence, but I did
fail quite a few times at the big boss battles during the action
sequences. I felt like they were pretty bad because they were
just sloppy (which I mentioned above.) But, given the anime
package, they were pretty fun. I'd say that they should've been a
bit easier or shorter so that they didn't take away from the
roller coaster. In a lot of those action sequences there was real
bad frame-rate problems and on the version I played there was
some screen tearing near the end of the game. But other than
that, things looked really good.</p>

<p>I can recommend Asura's Wrath in the same way I'd recommend a good
movie or TV show. It's 8 hours worth of over-the-top insanity for
a reasonable price. I doubt it would be very replayable (even
replaying the one level for a score was really unexciting) and
this speaks ill of it /as a game/. But as a unique form of new
interactive entertainment... it's pretty good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I think I'm basically at
the end of the game. It was cool to play as Yasha at first,
although I was kind of disappointed I didn't get to play as
Berserker Asura. This game is totally nuts. Today I decided that
Deus looks like Ganon from Twilight Princess. Also, I think that
something I enjoy about this is how it is a lot like Bayonetta in
terms of its style and craziness. If only the action were as good
as Bayonetta, that would be awesome. But as it stands, the style
of the game is a really great substitute.</p>
