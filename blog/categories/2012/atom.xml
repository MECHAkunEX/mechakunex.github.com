    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn't do
any of the combat ones. I'm really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I'm moving it away from myself. It's
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the "stealth" mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the "recharging" missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying... I feel like I'm Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don't feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I'm pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren't precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I'll probably get used to it as I play. It's a fun little
game... definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn't have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the game tonight in about an hour. I did the Miasma
Cave, the last Arena season, and the fight against Therius. It was
a very sweet ending. Overall, I think this is one of the strongest
stories out of an RPG I've played. The ending is a little bit
tropey, but not incredibly and it really justifies the things that
are tropes. I was really affected by the relationship between Zael
and Calista. It felt as real as a movie. I really loved this
game. The combat system was really fun and challenging. I think
the next time I play I'll try not to get too powerful so the game
is a bit more challenging... but it was still good
anyways. Mistwalker keeps getting better and better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard of this game online as a weird Japanese rail-shooter. I
like rail-shooters, but I find the zombie aesthetic to be pretty
boring. I thought it would be cute to have the girls/Cupid/love
thing going on in the game. I wasn't let down in that regard, but
I found the gameplay to be very easy. I was able to clear one of
the girls in a very short period of time. I only had a hard time
with the "boss fights" because they all had different mechanics. I
really didn't get what was going on with the book shelf
situation. I got a pretty good score on my first run, it said I
got 82% of the maximum or something and I got the "Good End". But
it wasn't really the sort of thing with a lot of interesting depth
to it... like Sin &amp; Punishment. This is kind of disappointing, but
I didn't pay too much for the game.</p>

<p>I was slightly nervous that the game would be too scandalous but
it's not bad at all. The girls are all normal anime girls and
there's no cleavage or anything like that at all. The most racy it
gets is that the girl's skirts rustle and sometimes it flash their
underwear for a moment. I was pleased that the girls in swimsuits
were wearing sports one-pieces, like they were properly on a swim
team.</p>

<p>I think my favourite part of the game were the animations and
sounds... particularly how when the girls get close, they give
the character an invitation or if they "attack" from far away
they shout something like "Love" or "Really Like You" and the
words are coming at you.</p>

<p>It's a totally bizarre game, but not very deep. I'm not sure how
its depth compares to something like Resident Evil: Umbrella
Chronicles, which is structurally identical but with a zombie
skin. But, Gal*Gun isn't interesting enough for me to want to
play more than a few times.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I played for about an hour. I was surprised at how
quickly the new Jirall plot line was resolved. I was also very
sad that Calista was kidnapped. The game does a really good job
of making you feel really connected to and protective of
her. During the Jirall fight, I realized that I hadn't seen
Dagran in a long time... where is he?</p>

<p>After we got home from the day, I played again, all night (about
four hours, with some breaks for snacks, etc.) I basically beat
the game and got to the epilogue. The final sequences had some
really tough fights. I fought the final boss three times before
winning. The final reveal of the big bad was pretty intense. I
really liked the epilogue sequence with Calista's parents. It
seemed so appropriate for the couple to go on a little adventure
together before getting married. It's adorable. Calista's dress
was great too. I wish you could have her wear it during normal
gameplay. I feel like there's still a lot of stuff to do in the
game... people to talk to, weapons to continue upgrading,
etc. It's very strange. It's like the final sequence of Earthbound
or Dragon Warrior but amped to the max because there's so much to
do. It's exciting.</p>
