    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a much better movie than the last one. I think my
favourite part of it was how it is basically the story of Catholic
theology: God enters the Void and creates Angels to assist Him in
creating perfection, but later finds (or creates) Humans, who are
imperfect, but have agency and can therefore grow and experience
love, but this upsets His chief Angel who fights against Him out of
jealousy. This particular story takes an approach very similar to
His Dark Materials, where God loses and someone has to come and
save him. The film is very cool throughout.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote in my calendar to check on the DLC about six months after
I beat the game, when presumably it would all have been
released. It has. I looked for information about it and almost
none of it seems interesting, except Lightning's episode. But, I
found that it only takes about 25 minutes (including cut-scenes)
and that's not worth 5 bucks, so I just watched it. The new ending
is neat. I'm excited for 13-3. I love this battle system so much
and I find the world to be really cool too. I hope it can be
efficient for them to produce, make them lots of money, and make
FF15 amazing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn't see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.</p>

<p>The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he's a bad businessman because he doesn't have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O'Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.</p>

<p>I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There's this
text:</p>

<p>David Edelstein: "the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk" -- and
[in the movie] Ted says, "Wow, what does that even mean?" and
Audrey says, "I know, right?" So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss' sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth."</p>

<p>What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don't know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren't making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really awesome movie. The costumes and visuals were
amazing. The re-writing of the Snow White story was really
cool. Collins looked stunning. I loved the dance scene at the end
too. It was rad. The funny digs were neat too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot... it made it more
dramatic. It's also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I'm glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane's voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments... it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can't have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan's insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>
