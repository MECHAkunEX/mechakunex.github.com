    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I'm glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he'll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn't notice anything wrong with Allison's dancing. I'm
one of the "80% who don't know anything about ballet". It's kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it's all beautiful and can't notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family... she
don't seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a stressful episode, because it makes you feel so bad
for Allison. She seems really great, but in a lot of pain and
Rex isn't being the best for her.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There were some fun moments here. I loved when they were talking
about what they ate. I thought the "rivalry" between Beckanne
and Allison seemed edited out of proportion, especially
Beckanne's dinner with the girls.</p>

wouldn't actually leave the ballet.</p>
