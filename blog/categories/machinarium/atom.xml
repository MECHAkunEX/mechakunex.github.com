    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week or so, I've played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms---I played on the Mac.</p>

<p>It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven't played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end---it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.</p>

<p>I got the game <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html">for free</a>, so it was totally worth it. It costs <a href="http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287">$20</a>
and I'd say it is worth closer to $15.</p>
