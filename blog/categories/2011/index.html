<div class="entry-content">This was a big budget popcorn summer movie, but a pretty good one
of that category. It starts off, and sounds like, it will be just
like all the other movies, with practically the same setup; but it
quickly acknowledges that and goes in a different direction. They
didn't over use the faces, like they've done before, and they there
was only one real bad scene of Tom Cruise fawning over himself. I
think my major disappointments were its lack of a romantic sub-plot
and the lack of real consequences to not being able to use IMF
resources---even though they explicitly mention how that is
standing in their way at a few points, they solve the problem too
easily.

<div class="entry-content">I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn't read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn't select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I'd never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time... which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn't.

<div class="entry-content">This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren't totally showing, it gets a little real and that's
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.

<div class="entry-content">I've decided to be basically done with these games. Both are not
nearly as good as Deathsmiles, ESPgaluda II, or Mushihime-sama
Futari. Pink Sweets isn't even really good at all for me. Both
lack the insane music and really popping/flowing feel of the other
games. I think I might play MMP every once in a while to
experience it a little bit, but it's not something I love at
all. Overall, a bit of a bad purchase, seeing as I brought it back
from Japan myself.

<div class="entry-content">I really loved this movie. The plot is great. The story is very
subtle. For example, in an early scene George pressures Yukari into
a love hotel, seemingly to rape her, but I found it to be
incredibly clear that his real intentions were to force her to
stand up for herself by ensuring that inaction would lead to
something she definitely couldn't accept. It's got all the elements
of a great movie: fun, cute people, drama, love, beautiful
costumes, etc. At many times in the movie, I thought it was going
to go one way, but was wrong. For example, at one point their
consignment clothes are returned and they give up working together;
I assumed that Yukari---with her school skills---would create some
sort of advertising campaign and make their business work. Nope. I
like being surprised though. =) The music was also awesome.

<div class="entry-content">This was a neat movie. It reminds me a lot of Amelie---both in its
Frenchness and that there are slightly fantastical things going on
in an otherwise mundane plot. There was some pretty bad CG
work---the people on the platform in the opening sequence. The
characters were very funny and memorable. It was neat to learn
about Meilies---I read his Wikipedia page afterward. Nevertheless,
it seemed pretty shameless in its appeal to the Academy for awards:
it's a movie about how awesome movies are.

  <h2>2011</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/26/Game--Battlefield-3--PS3--2011--0/">Game: Battlefield 3 (PS3, 2011)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I played through the Battlefield 3 campaign.

A friend of mine lent me the game because he had played through it
and enjoyed it.

A little background before I discussed the game. I played through
all the original id FPS games: Wolf, Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2,
and then Quake 3. I got really into deathmatch around Quake 2 time
and played very competitively. The only console FPS games I have
ever played were Modern Warfare 1 and this. I basically had a 10
year gap of playing FPS games and have never played one on the
computer since then.

The first thing I noticed about this game was that the language
was very poor in attempt to be realistic, although they seem to
almost exclusively use the F swear word. This is most prominent in
the very beginning of the game when you are with a group of
people.

The graphics are quite good, although nothing really
spectacular. In some places, there are really bad glitches. For
example when you a driving a tank quickly there are fields of
shrubs popping into existence in front of you as you drive. The
degree to which they go to duplicate film is almost
embarrassing. There are many fake film grains and "dust in the
air" effects. One character model looks exactly like the voice
actor (who is a relatively famous actor). Why not just be a movie
if you really want to be a movie? While playing the game, the most
impressive thing is the lighting.

Another thing I noticed quickly about the game is how slow it
is. You feel like you are crawling all the time or that there is a
run button that you can't find and thus are in stealth mode or
something. This sluggishness extends to the aiming controls as
well. I found that the sensitively just increased the size of the
"jumps" rather than their frequency. This is definitely a place
where old games were vastly superior. I assume the change is to
support the inferior console controls and/or inferior mass player
population.

I assumed that it would be fun to be part of a squad and run
around with other dudes. But most of the time you are just
following one guy (with a giant "Follow" marker on his head) and
then you get somewhere and they give you something important to
do. (Inexplicably you are the best at everything, yet need to
always be told exactly what to do.) An annoying necessity to give
the player something exciting to do.

The squad mechanics are related to my least favourite thing about
the game: you feel like you never accomplished anything. There
were many times where I was with my squad trying to advance or
defend some position and there seem to be an infinite number of
attackers (both at that instant and because more would come) but
then I kill one guy and suddenly all the opponents are suddenly
dead and it is time to move forward. I feel like the abstraction
inside the game is that X enemies must be killed before you can
advance or one from each of the 12 positions, which otherwise
refill shortly. It's very strange and gives you the impression
that you are randomly shooting until the roller coaster moves on.

The shooting itself is very infantile. The aim assist system is so
strong that it seems like you can just alternately tap the left
and right shoulder buttons to bring up the sights... auto
aim... shoot... do it again. It is easily the most effective way
to play and it has basically no skill, yet it is also visually
jarring and makes me a little dizzy.

Dodging is just as easy because you don't need to. It's like an
action movie where every enemy always misses and the hero never
misses. You feel like there are always bullets flying but they
never hit you unless you are totally out in the open (i.e. not in
the right place... behind the guy you are following.) If you ever
do get hit, just duck for a few seconds and go back.

Since you don't have to really plan where to go (follow the guy),
or what to shoot (everything), or try very hard to shoot (auto
aim), or dodge, you rarely feel like you have any impact on
the game or any real challenge. It's just like a ride.

Roller coaster ride is normally a good thing to describe something
as, but in this case it has one of the bad aspects of a roller
coaster. You have no idea where you are going and don't feel like
you have control over it. There is literally never any reason to
go backwards or on a different path.

The only times I ever died was before I learned to always follow
the guy, during cutscenes (more below), and when I didn't realize
it wasn't time to advance (related to not following the guy.) I
never felt like any death was due to lack of skill, but was due to
the game's weird rules. (For example, you kill all the guys you
can see in front of you, but you haven't killed enough on the
other side, so when you get beyond them you instantly die from
advancing to far or everyone inexplicably turns to you because now
they can see you.... and you're the player.)

The ride has little breaks where you pilot vehicles. These seemed
like a preview for the multiplayer, because they weren't very fun
or challenging, but they were just a little break. The best part
was actually the pre-flight checks on the jet mission. Not because
it was particularly fun, but because it felt really realistic and
cute. I was kind of surprised at how boring the flying was. The
tank drive was just frustrating because it controlled so poorly. I
guess that's realistic. =)

Easily the worst thing about the game were the quick-time events
and the pseudo-cutscene where you need to do something. The QTEs
are so dumb because you have a split second to make a button
press, but there's no reason why that should be the button you
have to press and it is up so far. Basically this means that you
have to die three or four times and memorize the button sequence
at do it. This would not be so horrific it didn't take so long to
get back to where you were before. At the last QTE, the whole
sequence maybe took 40 seconds, but every time you died, it would
take about 160 seconds to reload. It was excruciating. Another
occasion was like that because you weren't really in a normal
cutscene, but control was taken away from you, but then suddenly
you need to shoot... but the rules of shooting were broken because
you can't aim. The first time I did I died because I tried to aim
and then shoot rather than just shoot. Argh.

The way they deal with failure in the game is really weird. If you
get shot at and died, you fall down dead. That's great. If you do
something incorrectly, like you don't get to the vehicle fast
enough, the game screen just turns black and you do it again. They
don't depict the consequence in any way. It's very weird and
jarring.

The height of the game for me was the sniper mission, because it
felt very cool and had great graphics.

The story of the game was fine. It was like a Tom Clancy book, but
with this strange interrogation/flash-back/flash-forward motif. I
thought it was really neat that you played the end first and then
went back, and the second time you did it, it seemed to be
harder... i.e. not actually harder, but with more enemies. Some
story segments were very meh. For instance, the HALO jump that the
soliders do is so lame compared to Metal Gear Solid 3.

A few tiny annoyances: You can't pause cutscenes and when I tried
I accidentally skipped on. They give you hints to do things even
if you are already doing them... like crouching, so you think you
must not really be crouching, so you stand up, and then you
die. Thanks game.

The game didn't give me any play statistics, but I started at
7:15pm (that was the earliest achievement at least, so it must
have been a bit before that) and the last achievement was at
1:38am, but I took a break to have a big snack, talk to the wife,
get ready for bed, etc. I'd reckon the game took about 5 hours.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/09/04/Game--El-Shaddai--Ascension-of-the-Metatron--PS3--2011--0/">Game: El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron (PS3, 2011)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-09-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I've been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I've been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.

I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.

Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don't like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it's pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn't have anywhere near the depth I'd like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.

The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It's simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there's no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn't play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn't totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.

Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don't
need it.

The most appropriate word for this game is "fantastic" in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.

The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you've
seen or thought of before and doesn't really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels' tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you're walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It's
really quite amazing.

What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It's very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.

The story is baffling. I can't tell if that's because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it's baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There's something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.

When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don't think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don't feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it's nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.

Overall, I'd say this is a must player.

Best Reader: YOU

I like [JC Fletcher's review](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/): "It's not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet." and "If
