<div class="entry-content">I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn't make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn't get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I'm doing terribly, but
it doesn't communicate to me in any way what I'm doing wrong. In
addition, I'm now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games... even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can't. Argh.

<div class="entry-content">This was a cute movie with a pretty unique plot. The main girl was
cute and wholesome. I feel like the ending was a bit empty though,
because other than going to AA there was no explanation of how
Arthur changed. Th end of the movie suggested that Arthur's only
problem was that he drank a lot (and perhaps having so many
resources exacerbated the impact of that), but didn't deal at all
with his lack of knowledge, etc.

<div class="entry-content">This is a crazy movie. It is very disturbing, but in a way that is
always beneath the surface in a hidden way. The double layered
fantasy world that the girls live in is terrible, but what's most
disturbing is that it is hiding a worse world. The fantasy within
that is really insane and feels very Japanese in its absurdity. I
liked that about it a lot. The visual effects and photography were
really interesting and different---particularly the beginning
sequence was crazy.

when there are amazing games I haven't played enough. So I'm
stopping. I did everything possible in the first world and
everything possible in the first half of the second world. The
horrible controls are not worth the adorable setting of the

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There's so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It's like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I'm a masochist and can't resist. I'll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.

<div class="entry-content">I finished the game tonight in about an hour. I did the Miasma
Cave, the last Arena season, and the fight against Therius. It was
a very sweet ending. Overall, I think this is one of the strongest
stories out of an RPG I've played. The ending is a little bit
tropey, but not incredibly and it really justifies the things that
are tropes. I was really affected by the relationship between Zael
and Calista. It felt as real as a movie. I really loved this
game. The combat system was really fun and challenging. I think
the next time I play I'll try not to get too powerful so the game
is a bit more challenging... but it was still good
anyways. Mistwalker keeps getting better and better.

<div class="entry-content">This morning I played for about an hour. I was surprised at how
quickly the new Jirall plot line was resolved. I was also very
sad that Calista was kidnapped. The game does a really good job
of making you feel really connected to and protective of
her. During the Jirall fight, I realized that I hadn't seen
Dagran in a long time... where is he?

After we got home from the day, I played again, all night (about
four hours, with some breaks for snacks, etc.) I basically beat
the game and got to the epilogue. The final sequences had some
really tough fights. I fought the final boss three times before
winning. The final reveal of the big bad was pretty intense. I
really liked the epilogue sequence with Calista's parents. It
seemed so appropriate for the couple to go on a little adventure
together before getting married. It's adorable. Calista's dress
was great too. I wish you could have her wear it during normal
gameplay. I feel like there's still a lot of stuff to do in the
game... people to talk to, weapons to continue upgrading,
etc. It's very strange. It's like the final sequence of Earthbound
or Dragon Warrior but amped to the max because there's so much to
do. It's exciting.

<div class="entry-content">I advanced the story quite a bit. I feel like I'm in the closing
stages: I'm going to fight Zangurak, then send the Outsider back,
and live happily ever after with Calista. I thought her wedding
dress was very cute and I liked the resolution of the wedding
plot. In the game play, there's been a bit of a boss rush of sorts
where boss encounters similar to ones from earlier in the game
keep coming back. It's fun though. The fight next to the Outside
was pretty exciting and difficult. That whole sequence going down
the tunnel was very difficult---I think I died three times.

I accidentally used the Auto-Equip feature and all my outfits
changed. It was very painful to go back to dressing all the girls
how I like.

where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.

<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I played for a lot. A new arena season was opened, so I
had a lot of fun playing it over and over so I could max out all
my currently available items, etc. I did it like seven times. In
addition to that, I did some story missions, including the
haunted mansion. The best part of that was Horace's ridiculous
comment about his wife afterwards. The stealth section escaping
from the castle was kind of odd, but worked as much as it needed
to. It was much better with Callista than with Zael alone. I'm
weirded out by Dagran being a sketch ball. I wonder where the
story is going. I presume that the Count is really the big bad in
some way, but maybe also I'll fight "The Outsider".

<div class="entry-content">I played for a lot today as I rested from being sick. There some
pretty memorable moments: I loved the joke about why one family
had been in charge of guarding the forbidden gate for so long. I
was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to say "No" to the
Count or console Callista... the romantic comedy structure is
really being forced on me. I find the establishment of Mirania as
this character with a weird "food" quirk to be pretty
hilarious. I'm still really enjoying this game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about two and half hours and got back to the town. I
find it very charming how much this story is like Aladdin or a
romantic comedy. It was also neat how there was a monster
summoning spot right before a boss fight, almost like if you were
having trouble you could grind there, because the game is
normally very closed and linear. It's a neat structure.

<div class="entry-content">I played again for about four hours. I got to the island and did
the two side quests there and then went to the Gurak base. I'm
really enjoying the flow of the story and the development of
Zael's & Callista's relationship. I changed the combat controls
to Manual and I find it quite a bit more fun, even though I liked
it before. It is understandable, but I don't like that I can't go
to the arena right now... I am really strapped for cash and I
have a lot of upgrades I'd like to do. I think the narrator is a
really fun, cute little touch.

<div class="entry-content">I started this game today. I pre-ordered it and have been excited
about it since I heard that it would come out. I don't think I've
ever really been an extremely "Sakaguchi" Final Fantasy fan... I
feel like I've responded more to Kitase's direction, but
nevertheless, I enjoyed Blue Dragon and LOOOVED Lost Odyssey, so
I had high expectations for this game. But, after being let down
so bad so recently by Xenoblade, I was a little skeptical.

When I first turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that the
language is surprisingly crass. I think the very first sentence
has a swear. It's not the worst curses, but it's there and it was
a little jarring.

After that, I really enjoyed how the game started "in media
res". You have a really immediate connection to the action and the
characters and they reveal themselves in a pretty nice and subdued
way. I think the voice acting is really good... especially
Syrene's voice actress. She sounds very, very cool. In general,
all the characters strike me as really interesting and cool. The
"sweet" girl seems very sweet too, which I like.

At this point in the story (after chapter 6), I really like how
"low-key" the story is. Coming from Xenoblade where you fight
God, it's nice to have a story that is much more low level and
intimate (at least at the beginning, who knows what will happen
in the end?)

When I first got to the tavern, I was kind of amazed by the unique
voice acting and animated interactions with the group. I was
worried that I had accidentally advanced the story when I was
trying to just wander around and talk to people.

I feel like the sub-quest system isn't very good, because there's
no list of who wants what from you. This is a place where
Xenoblade was clearly superior in the interface department, but
Last Story seems to be keeping you more connected with the
characters, at the expense of forgetting about them all together.

The equipment system is interesting. It seems like armor isn't
really that important because they were all equal for me, but
they seem to have different status effects after they've been
upgraded. There seems to be an assumption that you will be
upgrading every item, rather than reserving upgrading for the end
(as many games, in fact, assume.)

I bought all the weapons and armor that I could in the first town
and maxed them all out (up to getting some sort of rare item that
would be required to progress them.)

The concept of "local goods" seems strange. I get the inkling
that you can do arbitrage to make money... sounds tedious. I hope
it isn't necessary.

The clothing dying system is difficult for me to imagine how to
use effectively. I feel like I want to look online for a gallery
of cool colourings. The "invisible" option is very intriguing.

When I was exploring, I found the arena. Syrene's dialogue about
it was awesome... so funny. I had a really hard time the first
time in the arena, because I had yet grasped the combat system. I
originally felt like I needed to be up next to enemies all the
time, but now I feel like it is more important to manage the
battlefield and setup sneak attacks, etc. I think I may also want
to turn on the "Manual" attack mode, because I think it will feel
better.

After I died and retried in the arena, I then played through the
first Season of the arena six more times. The combat system
is *really* *really* fun. I like it a lot and it was cool to just
go at it and feel the excitement of the mechanics. What an
awesome change from Xenoblade.

I moved on with the story after that and met Lisa... accidentally
tried to walk in on them in the bath and got some really funny
text. Then moved on to the next area. The boss in that area was
difficult to do properly, because I didn't realize I could do a
Slash over the railing. I was trying to get the auto-attack to
happen and it never did before I got hosed. Once I realized that
I could Slash, it was cake and I learned more about the game.

From this experience, I can say that I really love this game play
so far and I've very excited to see where the story goes too.

sloppily. The character just swishes around all the time, it is
incredibly obnoxious and hard to deal with.

<div class="entry-content">My son picked this game out because of its box art and it is in
my "new game queue". I'd been planning on playing it co-op with
my wife, but I couldn't dissuade him from wanting to check it
out. I've never played a Rayman game before, so I didn't know
what to expect other than that it is a platformer.

I found the world to be really cute and the art to be awesome.

I think the controls are really floaty and delayed (especially
the punches). The running doesn't feel quite right either. But
I'd say it is still on par with DKCR, and not totally terrible.

We played two levels. The first I played twice so I could get all
the stuff and the second I was one shiny thing away from the
second bonus. The collectathon in this game seems more fun that
the collectathons in DKCR and I'm not sure if I like them more or
less than NSMBW.

I couldn't figure out how to play multiplayer... maybe I just
needed to have two active controllers. Nor could I understand
what the difference between the characters were. I hope to play
it with my wife eventually, but I probably won't play again for a
while unless the kids request it.

each other and said: "This movie is like the Goonies, but
AMAZING!" It starts so chill and then gets crazy. The young actors
are awesome and Elle Fanning is really cute with the kid. The
story was pretty neat... a kind of myth of the pure native, but in
a different way. The concept of the ship was really cool. The
meta-arc of the kids making the film was really neat too. Overall,
it was very cool and nostalgic. I liked all the ironic references
to what was exciting in technology during the early 80s.

none of it seems interesting, except Lightning's episode. But, I
found that it only takes about 25 minutes (including cut-scenes)
and that's not worth 5 bucks, so I just watched it. The new ending
is neat. I'm excited for 13-3. I love this battle system so much
and I find the world to be really cool too. I hope it can be
efficient for them to produce, make them lots of money, and make
FF15 amazing.

Downey to do his thing. It's funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There's lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.

worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance

-- Review --

This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It's exactly like Demon's Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon's Souls.

I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could've been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren't a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.

The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I'm undead, there's a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don't really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon's Souls story was very
coherent.

The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it's all interconnected. It's very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly "level"-y.

I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon's. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don't
think it really evolved that much.

The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn't even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last... maybe I
just found a better farming spot.

The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon's, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don't really find the
game that difficult... just a good challenge... like Mega Man.

I'm a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon's. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks---about the same
amount of total days, I think.

Overall, I loved the game. But, I won't be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I'd really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.

Duke's Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good... still hard because you've got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up...
it's all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow... just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.

I "love" seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel's Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I'd
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn't kill him...). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave... which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain... and a major mistake to go down there. I think I'll
grind for souls and just buy them.

Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me

insane, because there are two of them, I can't really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.

<div class="entry-content">Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well... not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.

<div class="entry-content">This was a pretty cheesy comic book movie. The story was quite
different than others, with its god-like characters and its vast
universe.

On one hand, I liked that it didn't really dwell on the fact that
aliens exist, etc. But on the hand, that was the most interesting
part of the movie, but it was also totally unfulfilled.

The characters all play totally to type and lots of character
development consists of almost a single scene to establish the type
and then the movie moves on. (Most of the scenes with Blake
Lively.)

My other favourite scene was the opening dog fight with the
experimental planes. It was interesting how it foreshadowed the
ending. It was unfortunate that an otherwise heroic moment was
shattered by a cliche character reveal.

And one more... when Blake saw through the disguise. Brilliant.

But despite a few high moments, it's a pretty vapid movie.

plummeted to my death. Nice.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours tonight. I explored the rest of
Sen's Fortress (or at least, I got to the boss) and then I
unlocked a shortcut to the boss, and then I tried to fight the
boss many many times. I could generally avoid almost every single
attack... occasionally I would get grabbed, but I could generally
heal myself. The main problem was that I kept getting knocked off
the tower by him. I probably fought him about 20 times. I explored
a number of different weapon options. Probably the best was
putting a Lightning enhancement on my Iaito, but I didn't have
enough to keep using it. Eventually I used the Drake Sword
(because Iaito's bleed didn't effect the Golem.) I won and it felt
real good. I explored the next area a tiny bit. I killed all the
Sentinels and got a level from that. I'm excited to be making
steady progress.

near Sen's Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I'm supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.

<div class="entry-content">I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.

I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She's a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That's important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said "Amazing chest ahead". It's so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.

After failing utterly fighting her *and* realizing I hadn't
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn't buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.

I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn't
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.

So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I'd get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.) 

After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.

I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.

With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds---first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit *real* hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.

So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I'll have to
perfect it later.

<div class="entry-content">I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie and the other ones were
pretty bad. I think their biggest failure was being too fantasy and
with too many monsters, etc. This movie doesn't have that problem,
but it is definitely not as good as previous ones.

There are some fun moments of *REDACTED* Sparrow being *REDACTED* Sparrow. A
few absurd fights and chases. It's a fairly fun and crazy movie.
The mermaids are totally beautiful and the mermaid who serves as
the love interest has a very sweet and innocent feel to her.

If you stop to think about a lot of the movie, it is pretty absurd
and silly, but I'm not sure I should really expect anything
different. It's a solid B+. I think with a few more exciting fights
and a bit more plot coherence it could have been an A-.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I spent the time
working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I
would get repeatedly pummeled by the huge ghouls and then I kept
falling off and getting swarmed closer to the swamp. It was pretty
rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.

Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls... about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.

It's very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon's Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can't get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It's kind of frustrating.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn't recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn't skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.

I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.

I'm still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I'm getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That'll be nice to experiment with.

<div class="entry-content">I played today for a little over an hour. I got through the next
part of the Undead Parish. The Rhino was pretty tough and got me
once. Then I weaved my way around and accidentally stumbled into
the Bell Gargoyle fight. I died the first three times and then
accidentally died on the way. So I lost about 6k souls. Ouch. This
game is definitely great.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about four hours today and got used to the game. I
spent a long time planning my character based on remembering what
was a good strategy in Demon's Souls. I'll be taking the same
approach: really fast, huge shield, melee focus, but with a good
bow.

The tutorial phase of the game was much shorter and so far the
game seems incredibly linear, which I thought wasn't the case, but
maybe I'm just still in the beginning. Last time I took a very
linear approach through the game, but this time I intend to
explore a bit more.

The mechanics of the game are basically identical. The graphics
seem a little bit better... primarily in the lightning department,
but I don't know if I can really tell or I just have a bad
memory. It seems like this simply *is* Demon's Souls with a little
bit of a different structure---no hub, Humanity, etc.

That makes it sound like I don't like the idea of that, but I'm
actually very excited about playing it.

During my time tonight, I died twice. Each time against a boss on
my first fight with them. The game seems just as hard as before,
but I'm getting used to the controls again and learning how the
bosses behave. Overall, it's a pretty awesome game.

Here are my current stats (where ! indicates that the stat is at
the level I intend to leave it at for the foreseeable future):

<div class="entry-content">I played tonight for about an hour and beat the last two levels on
my first try (tonight, the second to last level took me about four
or five tries total.) The final level was basically a boss rush
plus a new boss at the end. It was pretty rad.

I concurred with everything I said yesterday. This game is worth
everything I paid for it. ;) I would've probably been happy if I
paid $15 for it. I intend to gradually play through the levels
again on Hard and through the Challenge mode. Probably once a week
on Sunday. I enjoyed the game and it will be in the back of my
mind for a while, but it's not a revelation.

I wonder how it is with Kinect or Move?

<div class="entry-content">I got this game as a prize from Call of Podcast for writing about
my game management system. It was on my to-buy list before that,
although I was planning on buying the PS3 version. The game looked
really beautiful and I really like Genki Rockets. I played Rez for
the Dreamcast and wasn't really blown away, but I thought that it
might be more interesting in a more modern form.

The game opens up with a really intriguing video and quickly shows
off its unique, beautiful world.

I played it for about an hour and half tonight. I beat the
first three levels on the first try, although I had to do each
twice to unlock the next level. I played the fourth level about
four times, but kept dying at the final form of the boss, because
it shoots so many tracer rounds.

I find the gameplay to be enjoyable and challenging, at least when
you get totally overwhelmed by bullets. I suppose I should get
better at using the screen clearing bombs. The addition of the
tracer rounds seems like it would be an insignificant change, but
it makes a huge difference compared to Rez.

I love the music, although I wish that there were more vocals,
like the actual Genki Rockets song. It may be that I'm not playing
well enough to unlock them though... on that note, I dislike how
it seems like I am doing the levels perfect (not getting hit,
getting mostly perfect octo-locks) but I'm only get three stars a
pop. It's weird.

I love that every level is totally different visually and aurally
from the others. This game is the perfect of a game that seems
like it was made on a totally different planet. I've played plenty
of Japanese games that do this, but most Western games lack that
kind of creativity.

I intend to keep trucking at it and beat. I haven't yet decided if
I will play through the hard mode or if I will just periodically
play through the whole game when I want to chill out to some rad
music, or show someone the game.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really rad movie. It had a similar amazing look as 300,
but was much more fantasy oriented. The actions of the Gods in the
movie are awesome and not quite like anything I'd ever seen
before. The actions are the humans are exciting and down to Earth
in a neat contrasting way. Mickey Rourke does an amazing job as a
crazy warlord. The movie is a really great spectacle piece and is
totally worth it just for the way the Greek Gods are presented.

<div class="entry-content">This is a cool spy-action movie. I like how it emphasizes the
"soft" part of spy work (but not as much as something like
/Spygame/.) And, I think the fight scenes are really cool because
they are so slow and feel realistic. In a strange way, her
controlled fighting makes it almost less exciting, because she
seems so confident and in control all the time. There was lots of
neat camera work---mainly during the chase sequences. And, the
structuring of the story telling (in the beginning, she's narrating
to someone else) is interesting. The one thing I think could have
been a lot better about the movie was the final reveal: the reason
for the betrayal could have been more meaningful and cooler. But,
overall, it was a pretty rad movie. I can imagine watching more
movies with Gina Carano starring.

<div class="entry-content">Another stupid, crazy, spectacle movie. The plot is pretty
incomprehensible, but who cares, or expects better? The visuals
were really amazing. I was kind of annoyed that Megan Fox wasn't in
it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn't work for what they had the girl do, but I don't
see why that was a necessary plot point. Either way, the whole
movie was some good stupid fun.

<div class="entry-content">This was a really fascinating movie. It's a totally unique dystopia
for me (maybe Wikipedia will tell me about things that are like
it?) and that is always fascinating. The plot is basically Bonnie &
Clyde after an initial glance at the prejudice and hardship in the
system.

The imagery is really cool and there are lots of interesting and
bizarre situations, like the way Wies introduces his female
relatives.

I think the movie lost some good opportunities for character
development. For example, Will gets 30 minutes for lunch at the
beginning but she dies by seconds when she can't take the bus, and
was just 20 minutes short of being able to pay for the bus
ride. Yet, he doesn't acknowledge this for the sake of the audience
or to show his great remorse, etc.

Overall, I found the movie to be very intriguing. This, however, is
also its biggest problem because it begs you to think about it
deeply and the world isn't explained well enough.

For example, there's a strong suggestion that the mantra "For few to
be immortal, many must die" has some sort of quasi-mystical and
dreadful significance. Like there is some sort of Big Brother type
that is keeping people down. However, this isn't followed through.

The purpose of the Time Keepers is not explained adequately. On one
level, they are simply cops and since money is time, they are
connected to time. However, in the end, when they're talking about
how "that much money can't leave that zone" and many other
situations, you get the impression that there is some deeper
purpose to their actions.

Similarly, the movie has poor economics. For example, what effect
does birth have, given that it introduces a year of time? If the
time is a real commodity---i.e. an abstraction of some sort of
energy their bodies need, rather than a fiat system (i.e. they are
like nanomachines that keep track of the time and just kill you
when it is zero.)---then where does the new year come from? How
could there be such price controls?

I think the movie could have resolved this better by coming up with
some sort of origin story and pseudo-science to explain why people
would choose to live like this (and everyone!) at some point
voluntarily and how it works. I think the fiat system would have
been interesting, because it makes it so there's actually a
solution that they could possibly reach. But, as it is, we can't
imagine that Will and Sylvia will ever actually fix
anything... other than what communists and Robin Hoods try to do
and fail to do in the real world.

The movie is very confused, therefore, with what its message (and
the message of its heroes) really is. Philippe spouts
pseudo-Capitalism, so perhaps the movie is anti-Capitalism? Yet,
the corruption of the Time Keepers vis a vis Fortis is reminiscent
of the relationship between the US and e.g. African dictators. So,
is it an anti "Globalization" or "Imperialist" politic?

I think because they don't foreshadow a solution or great evil
through technology or metaphysics, the world must be a "natural"
world and so the villain must be natural, and they rhetoric of the
movie leaves nothing left but a political agenda. Yet, it doesn't
articulate what the agenda is.

The movie is good for making it possible to think of it like this,
but it is bad because by not answering these questions, it is
incoherent and vapid.

<div class="entry-content">This movie was really different than I thought it would be. I
expected that the end of the movie would be closer to ape dominance
and I expected that the character of Caesar would be more of a hero
for humans---kind of the only smart ape that loved humans, whereas
the other ones (like Koba) would just hate them. The movie was
pretty cool and Caesar was a great epic leader. There were lots of
really cool "A-hah!" moments of his progression that were super
satisfying. I'd like to see sequels to this made.

<div class="entry-content">This was a big budget popcorn summer movie, but a pretty good one
of that category. It starts off, and sounds like, it will be just
like all the other movies, with practically the same setup; but it
quickly acknowledges that and goes in a different direction. They
didn't over use the faces, like they've done before, and they there
was only one real bad scene of Tom Cruise fawning over himself. I
think my major disappointments were its lack of a romantic sub-plot
and the lack of real consequences to not being able to use IMF
resources---even though they explicitly mention how that is
standing in their way at a few points, they solve the problem too
easily.

inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren't totally showing, it gets a little real and that's
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.

<div class="entry-content">I really loved this movie. The plot is great. The story is very
subtle. For example, in an early scene George pressures Yukari into
a love hotel, seemingly to rape her, but I found it to be
incredibly clear that his real intentions were to force her to
stand up for herself by ensuring that inaction would lead to
something she definitely couldn't accept. It's got all the elements
of a great movie: fun, cute people, drama, love, beautiful
costumes, etc. At many times in the movie, I thought it was going
to go one way, but was wrong. For example, at one point their
consignment clothes are returned and they give up working together;
I assumed that Yukari---with her school skills---would create some
sort of advertising campaign and make their business work. Nope. I
like being surprised though. =) The music was also awesome.

<div class="entry-content">This was a neat movie. It reminds me a lot of Amelie---both in its
Frenchness and that there are slightly fantastical things going on
in an otherwise mundane plot. There was some pretty bad CG
work---the people on the platform in the opening sequence. The
characters were very funny and memorable. It was neat to learn
about Meilies---I read his Wikipedia page afterward. Nevertheless,
it seemed pretty shameless in its appeal to the Academy for awards:
it's a movie about how awesome movies are.

<div class="entry-content">[Joystiq](http://feeds.joystiq.com/~r/weblogsinc/joystiq/~3/J72px2lMtpU/) - He mentions some appalling music tracks: agree. He
doesn't like Chocobolina: I agree, but I also don't care. He
thought it was hard: I disagree. I don't think his review is very
deep.

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml) - I like the review.

[Kotaku](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/excerpts/~3/2gL3kyCtDGw/final-fantasy-xiii%2B2-the-kotaku-review) - Also like it

[Edge](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/) - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won't get
you that.

[Christian Nutt in Gamasutra](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php) - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn't need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?

[2D-X Diaries](http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/) - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks
like Samus (and has ridiculous hot pants.)

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/02/27/Game--Final-Fantasy-13-2--PS3--2011--23/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 2 (PS3, 2011) - Review/Summary</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-02-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Now that I've beat the game and 100%'d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect---there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor---a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.

FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem---the UI is much better in ways you wouldn't
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun & diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
"mechanics", much better, in fact.

There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the "drive" of the
characters---escape---consumes all story bandwidth.

But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn't even re-use every environment and there didn't seem to
be very much from the "whole game of content" that was cut
from 13.

However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don't think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn't feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.

This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn't pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content---the super hard bosses, like FF13's missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.

In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13's 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.

Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.

Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope---other than To Be Continued---that would've
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.

Overall, I'm glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I'm not sure I'd
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I'd hope for a bit more
improvements.

I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.

<div class="entry-content">Today I am looking for more monsters... on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I'll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy---I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I'm kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don't want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I'll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It's weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn't see any extra scene... will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits... that's it... so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there's no harder monsters to challenge, so it's like it isn't
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn't acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]

<div class="entry-content">Today's plan is to try and kill the Long Gui and the Yomi. Killed
the Long Gui on the second try with 2 staggers and 5 stars. Beat
Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the "last time on
FF13-2", it shows Lightning saying "It's up to you to keep hope
alive". It was "It's up to you to keep Hope alive", then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn't on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content">Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There's a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool---especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the "real/good" ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. "The Future
is Hope" ending is strange because it seems like the "true"
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good---but it's very anti-climatic... although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: "A new adventure was just beginning---the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!" Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough... it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn't feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn't been any explanation given of why Snow is a l'Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower--The A.Z Files---reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
that can be done in the game still. [050:43:10 Frags 157/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content">I found another random fragment in New Bodhum 700 AF. I find it
very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem
totally hidden... like I can't really find them until something in
the game changes... like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don't like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh's appearance is pretty funny. Hope's
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn't get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can't make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) -- bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can't just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah's earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending... Lightning on
the goddess Etro's throne looked wicked cool though. "To Be
Continued"? FF13-3? Or just one of the other endings? I don't
understand what the Paradox Scope will do... should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each
gate that has free fragments. [036:33:45 Frags 102/160 Lvl 418]

<div class="entry-content">Exploring 100 AF Bresha Ruins. This has been like one of two so
far missions where you have to travel to the
past/future. Actually, I've got to jump around quite a
bit. Something I'm not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I've been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM... the hover doesn't seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting... Mog is so funny in his
opinions about humans. :) I'm running the slot machines on auto
and got three ochu! But I then lost everything in Super Victory
Mode, so I didn't keep the save. [033:45:14 Frags 99/160 Lvl 369]

<div class="entry-content">It is kind of crazy to go through the same areas like 4 times. The
fact that there is kind of a "hidden object" game inside this game
is strange when you reflect on it. I love my clock solver. The
dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine---would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn't;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius' life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I've been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They've firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn't win him as a monster? I tried Lightning & Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight's stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I'll be put into the
end game. [030:49:01 Frags 83/160 Lvl 337]

<div class="entry-content">They do a really good job communicating Serah's changing feelings
about her task... from meeting Lightning to saving the future. It
is getting hard to keep track of what episode I am in. I think I
found the Casino (mini games!) and a place that will lead to
Lightning at the end of the game. Some of these assets are clearly
re-used, because they are places from FF13, but they look so
different, I don't see how this is any cheaper to make than a new
game. The Moogle Toss system is funny. It has just hit me that the
Preemptive Strike bonus is a lot weaker in this game: just about
half staggered and Haste. I got to Serendipity for the first
time... Chocobo races!!! The Proto fal'Cie in Academia are
crazy. The Academia part is really annoying because you are
overwhelmed with monsters, but they don't give any gil or CP. I
just noticed you can get 6 digits of HP. I intend to go to the
fragment reward place every day. I decided to keep track of my
levels differently, by adding them up because I won't go past 60
for a while. That also means that I won't need to keep two
numbers, since they will be the same. I made a mistake when I
expanded Serah's Crystarium. I maxed out my two main roles and
should have gotten another role, but instead expanded my
accessories. Oh well. It is so tempting to not read about some of
the mechanical details... like how many levels you can get
(presumably 99 in each?) what the fragment skills are,
etc. [014:06:26 Frags 21/160 Lvl 168]

<div class="entry-content">I've been using a lot of Phoenix Downs since I got to the Yassaf
Machif (?). Seems like a bad thing. It's pretty crazy to see Hope
as an older dude. I accidentally closed the Bresha gate and had to
redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It's pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won't do that good thing and you'll
drastically change what they did---probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]

Serah be primarily Ravager and Noel primarily Commando. Their
primary role is N, their secondary is N/2, and their others is
N/4. All the monsters are at level N/4 as well. I don't know if
this is a very good strategy. I am slightly worried that it won't

role... I think at least. [004:56:03 (31/28) (8/160)]

<div class="entry-content">The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there's
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different... a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control... like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you'll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I'm glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can't tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/26/Game--Battlefield-3--PS3--2011--0/">Game: Battlefield 3 (PS3, 2011)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Yesterday I played through the Battlefield 3 campaign.

A friend of mine lent me the game because he had played through it
and enjoyed it.

A little background before I discussed the game. I played through
all the original id FPS games: Wolf, Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2,
and then Quake 3. I got really into deathmatch around Quake 2 time
and played very competitively. The only console FPS games I have
ever played were Modern Warfare 1 and this. I basically had a 10
year gap of playing FPS games and have never played one on the
computer since then.

The first thing I noticed about this game was that the language
was very poor in attempt to be realistic, although they seem to
almost exclusively use the F swear word. This is most prominent in
the very beginning of the game when you are with a group of
people.

The graphics are quite good, although nothing really
spectacular. In some places, there are really bad glitches. For
example when you a driving a tank quickly there are fields of
shrubs popping into existence in front of you as you drive. The
degree to which they go to duplicate film is almost
embarrassing. There are many fake film grains and "dust in the
air" effects. One character model looks exactly like the voice
actor (who is a relatively famous actor). Why not just be a movie
if you really want to be a movie? While playing the game, the most
impressive thing is the lighting.

Another thing I noticed quickly about the game is how slow it
is. You feel like you are crawling all the time or that there is a
run button that you can't find and thus are in stealth mode or
something. This sluggishness extends to the aiming controls as
well. I found that the sensitively just increased the size of the
"jumps" rather than their frequency. This is definitely a place
where old games were vastly superior. I assume the change is to
support the inferior console controls and/or inferior mass player
population.

I assumed that it would be fun to be part of a squad and run
around with other dudes. But most of the time you are just
following one guy (with a giant "Follow" marker on his head) and
then you get somewhere and they give you something important to
do. (Inexplicably you are the best at everything, yet need to
always be told exactly what to do.) An annoying necessity to give
the player something exciting to do.

The squad mechanics are related to my least favourite thing about
the game: you feel like you never accomplished anything. There
were many times where I was with my squad trying to advance or
defend some position and there seem to be an infinite number of
attackers (both at that instant and because more would come) but
then I kill one guy and suddenly all the opponents are suddenly
dead and it is time to move forward. I feel like the abstraction
inside the game is that X enemies must be killed before you can
advance or one from each of the 12 positions, which otherwise
refill shortly. It's very strange and gives you the impression
that you are randomly shooting until the roller coaster moves on.

The shooting itself is very infantile. The aim assist system is so
strong that it seems like you can just alternately tap the left
and right shoulder buttons to bring up the sights... auto
aim... shoot... do it again. It is easily the most effective way
to play and it has basically no skill, yet it is also visually
jarring and makes me a little dizzy.

Dodging is just as easy because you don't need to. It's like an
action movie where every enemy always misses and the hero never
misses. You feel like there are always bullets flying but they
never hit you unless you are totally out in the open (i.e. not in
the right place... behind the guy you are following.) If you ever
do get hit, just duck for a few seconds and go back.

Since you don't have to really plan where to go (follow the guy),
or what to shoot (everything), or try very hard to shoot (auto
aim), or dodge, you rarely feel like you have any impact on
the game or any real challenge. It's just like a ride.

Roller coaster ride is normally a good thing to describe something
as, but in this case it has one of the bad aspects of a roller
coaster. You have no idea where you are going and don't feel like
you have control over it. There is literally never any reason to
go backwards or on a different path.

The only times I ever died was before I learned to always follow
the guy, during cutscenes (more below), and when I didn't realize
it wasn't time to advance (related to not following the guy.) I
never felt like any death was due to lack of skill, but was due to
the game's weird rules. (For example, you kill all the guys you
can see in front of you, but you haven't killed enough on the
other side, so when you get beyond them you instantly die from
advancing to far or everyone inexplicably turns to you because now
they can see you.... and you're the player.)

The ride has little breaks where you pilot vehicles. These seemed
like a preview for the multiplayer, because they weren't very fun
or challenging, but they were just a little break. The best part
was actually the pre-flight checks on the jet mission. Not because
it was particularly fun, but because it felt really realistic and
cute. I was kind of surprised at how boring the flying was. The
tank drive was just frustrating because it controlled so poorly. I
guess that's realistic. =)

Easily the worst thing about the game were the quick-time events
and the pseudo-cutscene where you need to do something. The QTEs
are so dumb because you have a split second to make a button
press, but there's no reason why that should be the button you
have to press and it is up so far. Basically this means that you
have to die three or four times and memorize the button sequence
at do it. This would not be so horrific it didn't take so long to
get back to where you were before. At the last QTE, the whole
sequence maybe took 40 seconds, but every time you died, it would
take about 160 seconds to reload. It was excruciating. Another
occasion was like that because you weren't really in a normal
cutscene, but control was taken away from you, but then suddenly
you need to shoot... but the rules of shooting were broken because
you can't aim. The first time I did I died because I tried to aim
and then shoot rather than just shoot. Argh.

The way they deal with failure in the game is really weird. If you
get shot at and died, you fall down dead. That's great. If you do
something incorrectly, like you don't get to the vehicle fast
enough, the game screen just turns black and you do it again. They
don't depict the consequence in any way. It's very weird and
jarring.

The height of the game for me was the sniper mission, because it
felt very cool and had great graphics.

The story of the game was fine. It was like a Tom Clancy book, but
with this strange interrogation/flash-back/flash-forward motif. I
thought it was really neat that you played the end first and then
went back, and the second time you did it, it seemed to be
harder... i.e. not actually harder, but with more enemies. Some
story segments were very meh. For instance, the HALO jump that the
soliders do is so lame compared to Metal Gear Solid 3.

A few tiny annoyances: You can't pause cutscenes and when I tried
I accidentally skipped on. They give you hints to do things even
if you are already doing them... like crouching, so you think you
must not really be crouching, so you stand up, and then you
die. Thanks game.

The game didn't give me any play statistics, but I started at
7:15pm (that was the earliest achievement at least, so it must
have been a bit before that) and the last achievement was at
1:38am, but I took a break to have a big snack, talk to the wife,
get ready for bed, etc. I'd reckon the game took about 5 hours.

<time datetime="2011-09-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I've been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I've been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.

I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.

Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don't like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it's pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn't have anywhere near the depth I'd like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.

The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It's simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there's no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn't play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn't totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.

Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don't
need it.

The most appropriate word for this game is "fantastic" in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.

The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you've
seen or thought of before and doesn't really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels' tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you're walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It's
really quite amazing.

What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It's very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.

The story is baffling. I can't tell if that's because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it's baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There's something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.

When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don't think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don't feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it's nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.

Overall, I'd say this is a must player.

Best Reader: YOU

I like [JC Fletcher's review](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/): "It's not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet." and "If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing ... your dream has been
fulfilled."

<div class="entry-content">I've been playing Desktop Dungeons every few days for about two
months. I was able to get through the normal mode easily with the
Fighter and the advanced version of the Fighter, but I haven't
been able to with any other classes---I've tried the next Fighter
and the Thief, mainly the Thief. I feel like the game's random
creation engine is flawed and creates un-beatable dungeons. For
example, in the last one I did, I beat every enemy and was only
level 8, but the boss is always level 10 and indestructible. I've
decided to stop playing because of this... I gave it many chances,
but every play session is becoming too rote. Initially, I thought
it was very cool because it flet like a roguelike, but was very
bite-sized. I think the idea is still good, but needs to be
refined.
