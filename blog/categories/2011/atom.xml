    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched this on recommendation from some friends. I had never
heard of it, so I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know it was
a comedy. It was funny, but a lot of it was pretty low brow. I'm
not even sure I'd give it a three, despite the funny moments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son requested this again and I got all the awards on the second
level then got all the things on the third, except the medal and
the speed trophy. I found it un-intuitive to figure out how to do
the time course. I also find this game to control incredibly
sloppily. The character just swishes around all the time, it is
incredibly obnoxious and hard to deal with.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son picked this game out because of its box art and it is in
my "new game queue". I'd been planning on playing it co-op with
my wife, but I couldn't dissuade him from wanting to check it
out. I've never played a Rayman game before, so I didn't know
what to expect other than that it is a platformer.</p>

<p>I found the world to be really cute and the art to be awesome.</p>

<p>I think the controls are really floaty and delayed (especially
the punches). The running doesn't feel quite right either. But
I'd say it is still on par with DKCR, and not totally terrible.</p>

<p>We played two levels. The first I played twice so I could get all
the stuff and the second I was one shiny thing away from the
second bonus. The collectathon in this game seems more fun that
the collectathons in DKCR and I'm not sure if I like them more or
less than NSMBW.</p>

<p>I couldn't figure out how to play multiplayer... maybe I just
needed to have two active controllers. Nor could I understand
what the difference between the characters were. I hope to play
it with my wife eventually, but I probably won't play again for a
while unless the kids request it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an /awesome/ movie. At one moment, my wife and I looked at
each other and said: "This movie is like the Goonies, but
AMAZING!" It starts so chill and then gets crazy. The young actors
are awesome and Elle Fanning is really cute with the kid. The
story was pretty neat... a kind of myth of the pure native, but in
a different way. The concept of the ship was really cool. The
meta-arc of the kids making the film was really neat too. Overall,
it was very cool and nostalgic. I liked all the ironic references
to what was exciting in technology during the early 80s.</p>
