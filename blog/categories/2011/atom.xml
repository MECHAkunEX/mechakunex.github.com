    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There's so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It's like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I'm a masochist and can't resist. I'll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really nice movie. I felt like crying before the title
screen was even up. I cried a lot during the movie and found it
very uplifting. There were some problems with it... mainly that I
think a lot of assumes too much pre-existing knowledge about what
happened, rather than explaining it in the movie; particularly
with regard to the rescue. But it was an awesome movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played another level and got all the stuff in it, although I
was one second from getting the time flag. It was just because I
thought I would land on the flag, but actually had to move to the
right. Urgh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched this on recommendation from some friends. I had never
heard of it, so I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know it was
a comedy. It was funny, but a lot of it was pretty low brow. I'm
not even sure I'd give it a three, despite the funny moments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son requested this again and I got all the awards on the second
level then got all the things on the third, except the medal and
the speed trophy. I found it un-intuitive to figure out how to do
the time course. I also find this game to control incredibly
sloppily. The character just swishes around all the time, it is
incredibly obnoxious and hard to deal with.</p>
