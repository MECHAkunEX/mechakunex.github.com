    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided that life is too short to play games like Rayman Origins
when there are amazing games I haven't played enough. So I'm
stopping. I did everything possible in the first world and
everything possible in the first half of the second world. The
horrible controls are not worth the adorable setting of the
game... unfortunately.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There's so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It's like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I'm a masochist and can't resist. I'll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really nice movie. I felt like crying before the title
screen was even up. I cried a lot during the movie and found it
very uplifting. There were some problems with it... mainly that I
think a lot of assumes too much pre-existing knowledge about what
happened, rather than explaining it in the movie; particularly
with regard to the rescue. But it was an awesome movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played another level and got all the stuff in it, although I
was one second from getting the time flag. It was just because I
thought I would land on the flag, but actually had to move to the
right. Urgh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched this on recommendation from some friends. I had never
heard of it, so I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know it was
a comedy. It was funny, but a lot of it was pretty low brow. I'm
not even sure I'd give it a three, despite the funny moments.</p>
