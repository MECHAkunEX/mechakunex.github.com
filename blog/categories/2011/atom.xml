    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the last week I've been playing more than one puzzle a day
because I want to empty my queue. Tonight I played for a little
more two hours while watching YouTube videos. I did one of the
marble jump puzzles on my first try, it was awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It's funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There's lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a hilarious movie with lots of really subtle and clever
moments. It's really amazing and hard to express all the crazy,
funny things in it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd never read Jane Eyre before, but didn't have very big
expectations for this movie. It was very well done and pretty
fascinating. I found the story to go very slowly and have a really
unpredictable structure. I expected to learn more about the
boarding school, but did not. I expected to learn more about her
job after meeting the Rivers, but did not. It seemed like it was
going to be a horror story before the old wife is revealed. After
getting through my expectations, it was very enjoyable.</p>
