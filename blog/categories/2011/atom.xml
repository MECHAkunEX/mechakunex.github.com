    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an /awesome/ movie. At one moment, my wife and I looked at
each other and said: "This movie is like the Goonies, but
AMAZING!" It starts so chill and then gets crazy. The young actors
are awesome and Elle Fanning is really cute with the kid. The
story was pretty neat... a kind of myth of the pure native, but in
a different way. The concept of the ship was really cool. The
meta-arc of the kids making the film was really neat too. Overall,
it was very cool and nostalgic. I liked all the ironic references
to what was exciting in technology during the early 80s.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a whole bunch of puzzles today. I did all the ones in the
main game, plus the train, fish tank, and puppet mini-games. I am
still going to watch the "Episodes" and then do the bonus
puzzle challenges. (So I have like 15 puzzles left.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the game, although of course I still have extra puzzles
to do. It was a very cute ending. I'd say it wasn't the best
story, but it was very cute and probably the second best. I also
like how it explains how Luke and Layton meet. You do wonder where
Emmy and Decole went though.</p>

way, but kind of totally different. It's wild.</p>
