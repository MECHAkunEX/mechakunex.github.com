    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for almost an hour tonight. It is brilliant in
its simple setup, but complex puzzles. The controls are
horrible---you can't turn in mid-step, you can't stop on stairs,
and you don't always use a special attack when you think you
will. The graphics are horrific. The music is about 4 notes
repeated. But nevertheless, it's a really addicting and satisfying
game. It's neat that you can watch replays of your last
attempt. This game is very similar to Lolo-style games, but
different enough that it feels unique. I was very impressed.</p>

<p>On the Game Boy, apparently it has 80 levels, and I did 31. I
think I burnt myself out on it in the one sitting I did. I will
definitely play this again, and probably pick up where I was
before, but I'll mark it as done because I think I understand the
game pretty thoroughly and (like the Crush games) I can't really
binge on it.</p>

<p>Stage 31: XPAZ</p>

<p>Total time: 0:48</p>
