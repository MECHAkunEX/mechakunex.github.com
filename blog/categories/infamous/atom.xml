    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played inFAMOUS last night. I'm glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the "So, sorry, Sony" program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.</p>

<p>At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.</p>

<p>The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.</p>

<p>I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.</p>

<p>Ba-leted!</p>
