    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this today for a little more than half and hour. I sped
through up to Soda Popinski, although Bald Bull got me once and
Piston Honda got me another time. This game is so fun. I also
played it with my new XRGB Framemeister... so beautiful!</p>

<p>Total time: 0:37</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing this regularly for so long and I've never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried again. I lost against Honda the first try and then won in
the first round with my first knock down (it was interrupting his
special move.) I got a few hits on Soda Popinski, but then lost.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to show the wife this game and have her try it out. She
beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me
show her how it was done. She lost on the next fight but I took
the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:</p>
