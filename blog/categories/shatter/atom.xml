    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished Shatter.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a "bullet hall" influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It's really a blast to
play.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.</p>

<p>I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.</p>

<p>The only thing I didn't like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball's movement on them.</p>
