beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me
show her how it was done. She lost on the next fight but I took
the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:

<div class="entry-content">The first Mega Man game I think I owned and played a lot was Mega
Man 2. But I remember trying to play Mega Man 1 quite a few times,
I don't know if I bought it or if I rented it from
Blockbuster. Regardless, I wasn't very good at it and can't really
ever remember getting to Wily's Castle at all. I think the biggest
problem was the lack of continues or passwords.

Today that 20 year battle was finished and I played through all of
Mega Man.

I'm amazed at how good this game is. I had always kind of thought
that the sequel was drastically better. It definitely has lots of
improvements, but this game is definitely amazing too.

I used an Infinite Lives Game Genie code so I didn't have to
Continue, etc. The spacing of checkpoints is pretty wide in this
game though, so it was nowhere near a walk in the park.

I'm very proud of myself for defeating some of the really
difficult segments. For example, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NDK1tIaNwU&amp;feature=related][beginning of Guts Man's
stage]]; the [disappearing blocks section of Ice Man's stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ8cTlCMiE4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s); and
[Yellow Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahAKcUX5PW0).

This game makes you feel like a super hero. It's awesome.

<div class="entry-content">Played through Cut Man, Guts Man, and Ice Man. Guts Man's dropping
platform section was really rough, but nothing compared to Ice
Man's two screens of disappearing blocks followed by awful
circling death platforms.

After dinner, I played through the rest of the game. Wily's Castle
was insane. The hardest parts were the Wily Fortress 4 and Yellow
Devil. I did Yellow Devil sooo many times and I didn't use the
Thunder Beam or the pause trick. I have to admit that used the pause
trick on the final four robot masters and Wily.

the NES and SNES. In particular, I have very fond memories of
baseball games. I got the Japanese version of this game with my

definitely a very weak and primitive game. I will try the later
versions though, because maybe it got tighter and faster.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.

Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn't have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn't
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.

This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest... some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.

I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can't comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.

This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I'm glad I
played it.

Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles

<div class="entry-content">I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell... a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/10/16/Game--Zelda-II--The-Adventures-of-Link--NES--1987--0/">Game: Zelda II: The Adventures of Link (NES, 1987)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Zelda II: The Adventure of Link over a few
nights. The first night I got familiar with the game and leveled a
bit. The next night I beat the first palace and explored up to the
second palace. I didn't play for a while and then I played again
tonight. I played through to the sixth palace and got to the
boss. I died in my first fight with the boss and decided to put
the game down for the night. However, when I reset the cart so
that I could save the SRAM on my PowerPak it said that there was a
fatal error and I couldn't backup the SRAM. When I turned it back
on, I had lost my save data.

I had one boss and the last dungeon between me and the end of the
game. I declare it a draw. Maybe I'll try again some day, but it
is so debilitating to have to redo so much.

I don't remember playing this game as much as the first Zelda when
I was younger. I remember the first palace and the general style
of the game very much, but I don't remember making a lot of
progress or being very attached to it. When I played through this
time, I thought it was fun.

It has a reputation for being very difficult. I thought it was
about the same difficulty, but there were some things that were
different enough to feel harder. For example, after losing all
your lives, you don't continue at the place where you are, you go
back to the start of the whole game and it may be a long walk
back. This feels quite frustrating. Another thing is that a lot of
the enemies are cheap NES mobs that soak up a lot of damage and
seem impossible to every really connect with (the many shield
enemies are like this.) Finally, there are
Castlevania-Medusea-esque floating heads that knock you off a jump
when you are going over lava pits. Arrggh. There are some things
that seem easier, like the opportunity to level and cast spells
and that you can easily get all your health/magic back outside a
dungeon.

I definitely enjoyed the game and it will be on my long-run
rotation.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Bubble Bobble on the NES. It took about four
days: the first three days I did about 30 levels each and then I
did the rest and the boss on the last day. I had my wife help me for
the boss, so I could get a good 2-player ending.

I love this game. I remember playing it sooo many times with my
brother as a kid. It's really great. I don't remember some of the
levels being so hard and I don't remember ever beating the boss,
although I get the impression that I did.

It felt very good to conquer this game. I highly recommend it to
everyone. I'm looking forward to playing it with the *REDACTED* and the
Peach when they are older.

<div class="entry-content">I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that
comes with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. I remember playing
Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young... it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don't remember doing very well at
it.

I played through this game on the new "Easy" setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:

Mission record:
Difficulty: Easy
Play time: 3:03:07
Save: 37
Continue: 23
Alert Mode: 122
Humans Killed: 292
Ration Used: 33
Special Item: Not used
Code Name: Deer    

I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.

I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.
