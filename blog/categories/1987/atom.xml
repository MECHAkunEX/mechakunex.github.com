    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through this game today using a walkthrough, maps, and
an infinite lives/hearts code. I feel like the hearts code was
essential so I didn't have to grind. The lives code didn't seem
to make much of a difference, because the game is pretty easy
(re: Egoraptor's dissection of its layout problems.) The
walkthrough and maps were definitely essential because it is so
confusing and backwards. I feel like there wasn't really anything
valuable in this game, although the mechanics felt good, but it
just wasn't anywhere near as challenging as Castlevania 1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this today for a little more than half and hour. I sped
through up to Soda Popinski, although Bald Bull got me once and
Piston Honda got me another time. This game is so fun. I also
played it with my new XRGB Framemeister... so beautiful!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wasn't sure what to think of this movie before seeing it, but
I'd heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very
bad for the guy... it must have been hard to grow up like that and
to be used to so badly your whole life...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing this regularly for so long and I've never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried again. I lost against Honda the first try and then won in
the first round with my first knock down (it was interrupting his
special move.) I got a few hits on Soda Popinski, but then lost.</p>
