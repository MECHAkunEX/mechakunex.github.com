    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I've played
this many many times with other people... like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I've never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you're traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it's really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I'll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don't think it's strong enough to last on its own... but then
again, it's has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.</p>
