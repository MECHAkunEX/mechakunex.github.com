    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn't find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn't effectively do the "hit yourself" trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn't do that because I
didn't have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don't feel like you're getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I'm
curious about the story, but I'll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>
