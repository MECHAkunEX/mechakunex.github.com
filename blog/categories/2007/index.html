<div class="entry-content">This was an amazing movie. The visual were out of this world. The
story is so inspiring. Although it is pretty bloody, for some
reason there's really only like two gross parts. The grossest thing
was the disfigured people, but that's weird, mainly because it's
actually real.

Looking at the guys in the movie makes you feel tiny, puny, and
weak. It's super intense.

<div class="entry-content">I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and "camera" changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.

Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.

I can't tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don't feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.

I don't think I'd play it again, because I'm willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark... which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would've only last one
hit... and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.

After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an "accurate" polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &
their speed.) That would be funny.

Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)

learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There's a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to "fetch questy", but when you actually have
to remember what's going on, it feels more real and fun. It's an
interesting thing.

Here's my list: 
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff

strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I

weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn't go to before. I like it when things like that work out.

some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.

quest. So far it is intriguing. It is a little bit annoying to
take another group from level 1, especially when they don't have
new attributes (they're just a healer and a mage, like the
companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.

<div class="entry-content">I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.

Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the rest of the game... meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.

The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.

Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn't particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn't really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn't anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.

I don't think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn't dislike it enough
to quit.

<div class="entry-content">Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.

The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.

Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.

I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.

<div class="entry-content">The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I'm now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I'll do a few.

The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene's fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight... wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don't think I would have really minded too
much... unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42... which I definitely am not.

As I play this game more, I'm liking Maru more and more. He's so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo *Snow*. Ugh.

In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene's mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He's not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they'll get them
back and save the day... but how?

Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.

<div class="entry-content">I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene's character---and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery---is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.

I got all the skills for a few classes, so I've made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they've dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.

<div class="entry-content">Today I started from the beginning of Disc 2 and went to the
Ancient Prison. There weren't a lot of boss battles today, but
they were a few and a few more mini-bosses (seemingly unique
enemies, but without the boss battle music.) I got a lot of
equipment upgrades, but didn't gain many levels, either overall or
ranks in my classes. I wouldn't say there was anything hard today
either.

The story had a few revelations today. Most interesting was the
idea that the Ancients have not been seen in 10,000 years and that
Nene is one of these ancients... presumably the last one who "won"
the war and therefore is the "king" of the world, but lives so
secretively and without the need to interact with people, he's
effectively a force of nature from their perspective, and only
chooses to interact in so much as to bug them. Yet, he has
recently had some problems with his age, so he needs to use
Ancient technology again, but can't find it. (That's what you get
for killing everyone, I guess.) Although, the above summary is
definitely my surmise and not something the game explains.

This is an interesting concept, but the game doesn't uses its
curiosity as much as I am expanding on it in my head.

There were a few cute more things. I think my favourite was the
Pyre-Rat. The emotion of the machines sacrificing themselves was
very real.

I took a glance at a FAQ's TOC to see how far I was in the game
and it appears that I am near the end of this Disc, which is
strange to me, but maybe one of the final areas takes a long time?

I'm glad I have not needed to grind, because I would probably
quit.

<div class="entry-content">I played tonight a lot and got to the second disc.

Today there were a couple dumb mini-games: the wagon escort
mission and the MechaCat shooting segment. They weren't miserable,
but they weren't fun.

In Mural Town, I learned more about the world, which was kind of
interesting. It used to have magic, then it had robots, then
everything was destroyed. Still no real explanation of what's the
deal with the world though.

In Jibral, there's a really big town but it kind of loses
direction and you wander around aimlessly. I know some people like
stuff like this, because they feel like they can really explore,
etc, but I don't like it. I want focused, tight
experiences. Especially when exploration isn't necessarily fun
(e.g., in Castlevania it is fun to traverse and you fight things
on the way.)

I agree with Maru that Zola is pretty cool.

The final area of the disc was pretty epic. I like it when disc
changes are accompanied by awesomeness and not just running out of
space. There was a good boss rush and I actually died for the
first time against the knife throwing one. (My magic users were
Silenced and two attackers were Paralyzed and she spammed the
"Knife Rain" attack.) The fights were pretty tense tonight, which
was fun.

By today, they've firmly established that the plot is to take out
Nene, but I realized why I think it is weak. It's because the
characters themselves are so empty. They have no personal desires
or hurdles they need to overcome. They are more than totally blank
though: each has an archetype based on their relationship with
their parents. Whatev, I think that's why I'm not as crazy about
the motivation.

My class ranks are about 26 now. I looked in the instruction book
and it says that most classes top out at level 36 in terms of what
skills they get. I wonder what I'll choose for my number twos?

I wonder if my 14-hour through disc 1 should just be multiplied by
3 to get the today time? That would be about 40
hours. HowLongToBeat.com lists as having about 37 hours average
for normal playthroughs. I can't imagine doing a lot of bonus
content, so I expect I'm on track.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/01/Game--Blue-Dragon--X360--2007--1/">Game: Blue Dragon (X360, 2007) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-04-01T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>01</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks... about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I'm not totally
positive that the game didn't keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I'm pretty sure that accounting is accurate.

I've begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.

For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you'll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to "over charge" an attack so that you
go past some other character's turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person's turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there's a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.

I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.

The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a "base" to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.

Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It's not totally mindless. But I wouldn't
say I love it.

The story is pretty meh. I've been playing for 10 hours and I
don't really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.

The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named "Acornivores"
- The Devee dance party
- Maru's dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/03/31/Game--Blue-Dragon--X360--2007--0/">Game: Blue Dragon (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-03-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started this game tonight.

Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law's house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.

But, I never bought the game until this January---almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.

Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I've grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.

I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.

I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, "Anime!" It's a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.

In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l'Cie. Then they escape.

Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don't really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than "Get Home". I presume they'll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?

The battle system is very traditional. There's no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can't act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you'll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don't want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn't really explained.

I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.

Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don't get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.

The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That's a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there's isn't a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.

The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven't really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can't heal him
over it and I'm nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I'm spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.

I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won't give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little "Poo Piles" that say "(squish)
(squish)" when you search them. Nice!

<div class="entry-content">This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It's basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn't really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We've gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine---again
there's basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it's fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the "domesticated" zombie acts. It's really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.

On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe... inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.

  <h2>2011</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/10/Game--Eternal-Sonata--X360--2007--0/">Game: Eternal Sonata (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Eternal Sonata on the Xbox from October 17th to
last night. I remember downloading the PS3 demo when I was sick
one day when the *REDACTED* was very very young. It seemed pretty cool,
and I like Tri- games, so I've had on my list since then. I saw a
Craigslist posting about it and grabbed it for ten bucks. I
finished the game with 23:59:46 on the game clock and my A-team
was around level 53 (significantly lower than a FAQ I glanced at
recommended) and the other characters on the bench were around the
low 40s.

The story and setting of this game is really bizarre. It takes
place inside the mind of Chopin, the composer, on his death bed
and is about a group of people kinda fighting the big bad empire,
but at the end it takes an even more bizarre turn and loses all
comprehensibility. But it doesn't really matter. The end was even
worse for me because I used Japanese language with English
subtitles during the game and the ending had no subtitles. (Really
weird actually.) I don't regret it though because the few times I
heard the English voices was horrific.

The graphics are beautiful and cartoony. There are many tiny
details in the background which really give flair to the world. In
a word, the graphics are "lush"... in colour, in detail, in
scope... it's great. However it is incredibly unrealistic, unlike
say FF13 which is fantastic in a realistic way. One thing strange
about the art is how the characters look mostly like action
figures, but then there is uncanny shading on a nose, or under
eyes, or on cleavage, or even on the edge of their hair. I think
the worst part of most characters is how "stuck on" their hair
looks. In particular, Allegretto looks like a bald man wearing a
wig.

When I started I assumed that the music would have been amazing,
but it was just good. Nothing really special about it, but
definitely serviceable and a solid "good".

Now, let me comment on the mechanics.

It has a really weak meta-game, outside the combat. There is very
little constraint on your resources. Well, if you rely on battles
to give you money, you'll be struggling. However, Beat can take
pictures and sell even bad pictures for about 10k, where the best
weapons and items cost far less than even 3k. Since you can store
12 photos, this means that every time you visit a shop you can get
over 100k. This basically means you have infinite money. The real
constraint on your resources is that you always need to back-track
(the game is a straight line) to get to a shop, so you need to
make sure you stock up beforehand.

Other parts of the meta-game are a little annoying. For example,
you have an incredibly large party and balancing their levels
becomes very frustrating and I gave up around 15 hours in and just
stuck with one group. The exploration of dungeons can be very
annoying too. One of the prices of the lushness is that almost
every area of a big dungeon looks identical and every one is
either a literal maze or puzzle. These are fine in moderation, but
this game does it too much and rewards the exploration too
little. (There are very useful items in chests, for example.)

The largest part of the game is the battle system.

They do a good job unfolding the battle system with the Party
Level system that advances at fixed story parts and gives you new
challenges and options. In a nutshell, it works like this: each
character has their own turn that lasts a fixed amount of time,
they have some amount of Tactical Time before their clock ticks,
and movement/attacks take certain amounts of time. Time is
essentially your MP-like resource that controls what you
do. Special attacks are divided into dark and light categories
which you can only join when you are in light or dark
areas. Enemies are affect by the light too. It's a neat little
thing. As your party level goes up, some of these get more
complicated. For example, at the beginning tactical time is
infinite and at the end it is zero. At the end, the speed of your
characters just goes up a lot so you can get things done faster. I
would said it is almost too fast at the end... I accidentally ran
past enemies a lot.

Overall, the battle system was satisfying, but it has a lot of
flaws. First, there are things that are too cumbersome to actually
use, like switching special attack sets in battle. I'm amazed they
didn't bind that to the triggers. Second, the layout of the
characters, enemies, and arena are few in number in each area of
the game... on the order of two or three. This means once you
discover how to beat that enemy configuration, you can do the
exact same thing again. It gets old and makes you want to just run
past the enemies so you don't have to fight them. Third, there is
a single strategy that works for all random encounters and one
that is almost the same that works for all bosses. For normal
enemies, just do lots of little combos and take them out one by
one. For bosses, build up Harmony Chains (big combos) with two
characters and have the other one on healing duty. This makes lots
of fights incredibly rote and frankly a little
boring. Nevertheless, each session of playing had a significant
section where I enjoyed the smashing of buttons and increasing of
numbers.

I actually fell asleep during this game more than once. One time I
was even in battle and fell asleep briefly, then woke up and
survived the battle with the one character that wasn't dead yet. I
think in that case it says more about me than the game.

I thought about quitting the game a few times, but ultimately
decided to continue. I'd say it was worth it, but would have been
better if the game were shorter (or just better, of course.) I
doubt I will play this again. And so, I can't recommend it very
highly, despite being a reasonable game.

<div class="entry-content">I was very curious about this game because I'm fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.

Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There's no continuous spray of bullets and doesn't even
seem to be a normal "fire" weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn't play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.

I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don't think it's for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I'm too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.

<div class="entry-content">Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game... how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.

There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It's pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting---objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.

I'm at a point in my life where it's not worth it to read books
I'm not interested in, finish movies that I don't love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren't rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I'd like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I'll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Portal over
the last little bit. The game is really clever and unique. The
puzzles were nothing quite like I've experienced before and the
story is clever. I love the idea that you break out of a puzzle
game and use your skills "against" the game in the "real
world".

Definitely a great and memorable game.

  <h2>2010</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/26/Game--Etrian-Odyssey--DS--2007--0/">Game: Etrian Odyssey (DS, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.

I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).

# Things I liked

I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.

I like the art style.

I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: "There is a dungeon
outside the town."), it's natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn't often that I could "phone it in" and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.

I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you're
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can't defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)

I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)

# Things I didn't like

The mapping system isn't advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something---like the link between a
portal's entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way---where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn't be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.

The character customization didn't have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn't upgrade everything (there just aren't enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn't exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.

I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn't bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst
enemy and I wasn't making enough improvement after a few weeks of
sporadic play.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/11/Game--Overlord--X360--2007--0/">Game: Overlord (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-11T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>11</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.

I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don't remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you're supposed to stop the music but
you can't hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.

Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that's what the
rest of the game will be like, I'm not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn't seem that way and it didn't seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn't imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.

I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I'm quite picky, but because I'm so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?

I don't recommend it. But I didn't finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.

Frustrating, boring mechanic

  <h2>2009</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/20/Game--Assassin-s-Creed--X360--2007--0/">Game: Assassin's Creed (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-20T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren't that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn't even in the game, but mentioned
and [explained elsewhere](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552).

The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn't resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something "stealthily" or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn't make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn't even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It's not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the "real" way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin's mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.

An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn't fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren't necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.

The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn't angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would've liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!

Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin's Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don't they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous "gamey" thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!

One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin's Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can't follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don't control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can't have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, "Well, you're in the simulation anyways,
so it's already decided." That's true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
"ride", but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.

I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.

Repetitive, boring slog.
