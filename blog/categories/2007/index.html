<div class="entry-content">This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn't continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them "famous" or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.

<div class="entry-content">This was an amazing movie. The visual were out of this world. The
story is so inspiring. Although it is pretty bloody, for some
reason there's really only like two gross parts. The grossest thing
was the disfigured people, but that's weird, mainly because it's
actually real.

Looking at the guys in the movie makes you feel tiny, puny, and
weak. It's super intense.

<div class="entry-content">I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and "camera" changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.

Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.

I can't tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don't feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.

I don't think I'd play it again, because I'm willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark... which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would've only last one
hit... and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.

After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an "accurate" polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &
their speed.) That would be funny.

Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)

remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to "fetch questy", but when you actually have
to remember what's going on, it feels more real and fun. It's an
interesting thing.

weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went

companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.

<div class="entry-content">I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.

Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.

<div class="entry-content">This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It's basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn't really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We've gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine---again
there's basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it's fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the "domesticated" zombie acts. It's really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.

On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe... inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.

  <h2>2011</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/10/Game--Eternal-Sonata--X360--2007--0/">Game: Eternal Sonata (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Eternal Sonata on the Xbox from October 17th to
last night. I remember downloading the PS3 demo when I was sick
one day when the *REDACTED* was very very young. It seemed pretty cool,
and I like Tri- games, so I've had on my list since then. I saw a
Craigslist posting about it and grabbed it for ten bucks. I
finished the game with 23:59:46 on the game clock and my A-team
was around level 53 (significantly lower than a FAQ I glanced at
recommended) and the other characters on the bench were around the
low 40s.

The story and setting of this game is really bizarre. It takes
place inside the mind of Chopin, the composer, on his death bed
and is about a group of people kinda fighting the big bad empire,
but at the end it takes an even more bizarre turn and loses all
comprehensibility. But it doesn't really matter. The end was even
worse for me because I used Japanese language with English
subtitles during the game and the ending had no subtitles. (Really
weird actually.) I don't regret it though because the few times I
heard the English voices was horrific.

The graphics are beautiful and cartoony. There are many tiny
details in the background which really give flair to the world. In
a word, the graphics are "lush"... in colour, in detail, in
scope... it's great. However it is incredibly unrealistic, unlike
say FF13 which is fantastic in a realistic way. One thing strange
about the art is how the characters look mostly like action
figures, but then there is uncanny shading on a nose, or under
eyes, or on cleavage, or even on the edge of their hair. I think
the worst part of most characters is how "stuck on" their hair
looks. In particular, Allegretto looks like a bald man wearing a
wig.

When I started I assumed that the music would have been amazing,
but it was just good. Nothing really special about it, but
definitely serviceable and a solid "good".

Now, let me comment on the mechanics.

It has a really weak meta-game, outside the combat. There is very
little constraint on your resources. Well, if you rely on battles
to give you money, you'll be struggling. However, Beat can take
pictures and sell even bad pictures for about 10k, where the best
weapons and items cost far less than even 3k. Since you can store
12 photos, this means that every time you visit a shop you can get
over 100k. This basically means you have infinite money. The real
constraint on your resources is that you always need to back-track
(the game is a straight line) to get to a shop, so you need to
make sure you stock up beforehand.

Other parts of the meta-game are a little annoying. For example,
you have an incredibly large party and balancing their levels
becomes very frustrating and I gave up around 15 hours in and just
stuck with one group. The exploration of dungeons can be very
annoying too. One of the prices of the lushness is that almost
every area of a big dungeon looks identical and every one is
either a literal maze or puzzle. These are fine in moderation, but
this game does it too much and rewards the exploration too
little. (There are very useful items in chests, for example.)

The largest part of the game is the battle system.

They do a good job unfolding the battle system with the Party
Level system that advances at fixed story parts and gives you new
challenges and options. In a nutshell, it works like this: each
character has their own turn that lasts a fixed amount of time,
they have some amount of Tactical Time before their clock ticks,
and movement/attacks take certain amounts of time. Time is
essentially your MP-like resource that controls what you
do. Special attacks are divided into dark and light categories
which you can only join when you are in light or dark
areas. Enemies are affect by the light too. It's a neat little
thing. As your party level goes up, some of these get more
complicated. For example, at the beginning tactical time is
infinite and at the end it is zero. At the end, the speed of your
characters just goes up a lot so you can get things done faster. I
would said it is almost too fast at the end... I accidentally ran
past enemies a lot.

Overall, the battle system was satisfying, but it has a lot of
flaws. First, there are things that are too cumbersome to actually
use, like switching special attack sets in battle. I'm amazed they
didn't bind that to the triggers. Second, the layout of the
characters, enemies, and arena are few in number in each area of
the game... on the order of two or three. This means once you
discover how to beat that enemy configuration, you can do the
exact same thing again. It gets old and makes you want to just run
past the enemies so you don't have to fight them. Third, there is
a single strategy that works for all random encounters and one
that is almost the same that works for all bosses. For normal
enemies, just do lots of little combos and take them out one by
one. For bosses, build up Harmony Chains (big combos) with two
characters and have the other one on healing duty. This makes lots
of fights incredibly rote and frankly a little
boring. Nevertheless, each session of playing had a significant
section where I enjoyed the smashing of buttons and increasing of
numbers.

I actually fell asleep during this game more than once. One time I
was even in battle and fell asleep briefly, then woke up and
survived the battle with the one character that wasn't dead yet. I
think in that case it says more about me than the game.

I thought about quitting the game a few times, but ultimately
decided to continue. I'd say it was worth it, but would have been
better if the game were shorter (or just better, of course.) I
doubt I will play this again. And so, I can't recommend it very
highly, despite being a reasonable game.

<div class="entry-content">I was very curious about this game because I'm fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.

Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There's no continuous spray of bullets and doesn't even
seem to be a normal "fire" weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn't play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.

I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don't think it's for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I'm too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.

<div class="entry-content">Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game... how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.

There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It's pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting---objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.

I'm at a point in my life where it's not worth it to read books
I'm not interested in, finish movies that I don't love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren't rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I'd like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I'll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.

<div class="entry-content">I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.

It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.

There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn't check who you needed to
still visit.

All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.

Definitely a great and memorable game.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/31/Game--Lost-Odyssey--X360--2007--0/">Game: Lost Odyssey (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-31T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.

My completed game save reads: "43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50". During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.

As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.

The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
"Miss" appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of "time is frozen" style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.

The most amazing part of this game were the "Thousand Years of
Dreams" segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and "watch" these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those "dreams" are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby's cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim's character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim's loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here's what it said:

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey's "Thousand Years of Dreams" were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game's producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim's backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game's main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as "adding to the world's supply of<br/>senseless violence," he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being "shocked" at its pacifist message and "vivid<br/>imagery".</p></blockquote>

I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.

On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the "chocobo" music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.

The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven't played anything with better
looking environments.

There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying "mini-games": escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the "losing"
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.

The character models aren't very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good---especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that's
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It's really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to "perfect" male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming's body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)

On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.

On the subject of Ming's outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare [pictures of Ming](http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&biw=1050&bih=803) and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&biw=1050&bih=803&tbs=isch:1&sa=1&q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a "wispy" and "tendrily" style about them.

Another graphical thing: The "liquid" in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.

I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.

I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I'd ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn't run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn't look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.

Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details---like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.

In a word, I'd call the game "meaningful". There's a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.

One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn't be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren't really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/26/Game--Etrian-Odyssey--DS--2007--0/">Game: Etrian Odyssey (DS, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.

I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).

# Things I liked

I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.

I like the art style.

I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: "There is a dungeon
outside the town."), it's natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn't often that I could "phone it in" and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.

I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you're
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can't defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)

I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)

# Things I didn't like

The mapping system isn't advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something---like the link between a
portal's entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way---where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn't be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.

The character customization didn't have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn't upgrade everything (there just aren't enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn't exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.

I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn't bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst
enemy and I wasn't making enough improvement after a few weeks of
sporadic play.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/22/Game--Retro-Game-Challenge--DS--2007--0/">Game: Retro Game Challenge (DS, 2007)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">While I was on my tour, I played through most of Retro Game
Challenge and just completed the last challenge (beat all the
games) tonight. This game is incredibly brilliant.

The premise is that a demon version of a Japanese video game
playing TV star has sent you back into the 80s to challenge you
with old Famicom-style video games. You are presented with a game
and four challenges, when you complete most challenges you get a
new issue of a game magazine and when you complete all of them you
get another game and more challenges. Each game has an illustrated
manual. The game magazines are hilarious, because they will
preview games that you'll be unlocking soon, they'll report that a
game has been delayed, and they have a top 5 chart with hilarious
parody titles. When you play a game, it runs in to the top screen
of the DS, while on the bottom you see two kids sitting in front
of a TV playing. I love that the friend makes comments about how
you're playing as you do. It is hilarious.

The games are great too:
- *Cosmic Gate* - This is a Galaga-like fixed-screen shooter. It
is simple, but fun.
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man* - This is a single screen platformer,
like Bubble Bobble, although you throw ninja stars to stun
things. The main mechanic is going in "doors" that hurt the
enemies and protect you from damage. This isn't my favourite
game, but it is enjoyable.
- *Rally King* - A racing game like RC Pro Am. The cool part is
the drift mechanic. I'm not a huge fan of racers, so when I beat
this game for the final challenge I used invincibility.
- *Star Prince* - A straight-forward vertically scrolling
shooter. The weapon selection is great and the hidden bonus
items are fun to find. You get a special controller to play this
game which turns your Y button into a rapid-fire. One of my
favourite subtleties is that you fire faster the closer you are
to the top of the screen (which is dangerous.)
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2* - This game plays just like its
predecessor, although it is considerably more difficult and the
final boss is very interesting.
- *Rally King SP* - The same game as its predecessor but with new
graphics. The levels are the same, etc. This is a promotional
game for the game magazine and a soup company. Very funny.
- *Guadia Quest* - A Dragon Quest-style JRPG. A fun mechanic is
that you can capture strong enemies and they will fight for
you. It was very fun to play this old school RPG.
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3* - This is a reboot of the Robot Ninja
Haggle Man series with new graphics and gameplay. The gameplay
and graphics are incredibly reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden,
although the colors pop a lot more than the original NES Ninja
Gaidens. In addition to that core gameplay, there is a
customization system reminiscent of Super Metroid. This is a
little bit of exploration as well, but the levels are mostly
linear.

My favourite games were Star Prince, Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3, and
Guadia Quest.

I /highly/ recommend this one.

<div class="entry-content">In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn't start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.

I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.

It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that's how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction "mysteries" are simply crazy
things you can't possible know until they come out of left
field. I'm glad this game wasn't like that.

I'm definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.

<time datetime="2010-02-11T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>11</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.

I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don't remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you're supposed to stop the music but
you can't hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.

Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that's what the
rest of the game will be like, I'm not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn't seem that way and it didn't seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn't imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.

I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I'm quite picky, but because I'm so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?

I don't recommend it. But I didn't finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.

Frustrating, boring mechanic

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/20/Game--Assassin-s-Creed--X360--2007--0/">Game: Assassin's Creed (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-20T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren't that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn't even in the game, but mentioned
and [explained elsewhere](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552).

The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn't resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something "stealthily" or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn't make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn't even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It's not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the "real" way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin's mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.

An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn't fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren't necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.

The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn't angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would've liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!

Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin's Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don't they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous "gamey" thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!

One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin's Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can't follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don't control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can't have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, "Well, you're in the simulation anyways,
so it's already decided." That's true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
"ride", but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.

I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.

Repetitive, boring slog.
