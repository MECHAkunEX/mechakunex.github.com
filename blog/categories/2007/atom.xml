    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.</p>

<p>Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.</p>

<p>Total time: 6:40</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the game... meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn't particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn't really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn't anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don't think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn't dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I did two side quests and I tried to do a third but was
totally destroyed. I hope it isn't too much longer, because it is
getting a little tired. Nothing really to say else about the
game play today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I'm now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I'll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>
