    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn't continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them "famous" or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an amazing movie. The visual were out of this world. The
story is so inspiring. Although it is pretty bloody, for some
reason there's really only like two gross parts. The grossest thing
was the disfigured people, but that's weird, mainly because it's
actually real.</p>

<p>Looking at the guys in the movie makes you feel tiny, puny, and
weak. It's super intense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and "camera" changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.</p>

<p>I can't tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don't feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.</p>

<p>I don't think I'd play it again, because I'm willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.</p>

<p>Total time: 23:58</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark... which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would've only last one
hit... and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.</p>

<p>After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an "accurate" polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &amp;
their speed.) That would be funny.</p>

<p>Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)</p>

<p>Total time: 19:30</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There's a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to "fetch questy", but when you actually have
to remember what's going on, it feels more real and fun. It's an
interesting thing.</p>

<p>Here's my list:
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff</p>

<p>Total time: 16:51</p>
