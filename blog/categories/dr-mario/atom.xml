    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for about 45 minutes. I'd never really played it
before and I just assumed it was exactly the same as Tetris. But
it's much more complex and incredibly challenging.</p>

<p>I got to Level 8 with a score of 30,600.</p>

<p>During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense
pressure. The game board is so claustrophobic and you feel like
no decision is the right one. It's so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.</p>

<p>My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She's amazing!</p>

<p>Total time: 0:45</p>
