  <h2>2012</h2>

<article>
  
<h1><a href="/blog/2012/03/18/Movie--Resident-Evil--Apocalypse--starring-Milla-Jovovich--2004--0/">Movie: Resident Evil: Apocalypse, starring Milla Jovovich (2004)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-03-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements--for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I'm glad they didn't kill any kids.)

There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to "Kill all
STARS" and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis' display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.

Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements---something that is actually kind of rare---I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel... a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.

Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.

I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.

Overall, I can't say I like this. [Roger Ebert's review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023) is funny;
"The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children."

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/05/12/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid--The-Twin-Snakes--GC--2004--0/">Game: Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (GC, 2004)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-05-12T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>12</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes over the course
of about a week. This is a remake of Metal Gear Solid with a bit
of new gameplay, new cinematics, and generally improved graphics.

I had never played this remake, but I played the original many
times when it came out. I really enjoyed playing it again. It was
very nostalgic for me.

I noticed a lot of homages to the first two games. For example,
you meet Meryl in a bathroom; you fist fight with Gray Fox; there
is a key that changes with the temperature; and you fight in an
elevator against an assassination squad. All these happened in
Metal Gear: Solid Snake. Naturally, the themes are the
same---especially the idea that everyone betrays Snake.

The one annoying thing in the game was the tortue scene. They
don't tell you in the dialogue which button resists and which
button gives up. As soon as it started, I tried to call someone on
the Codec to find that out. Of course, the give up button was the
call button. Doh! I hadn't saved in hours, so I couldn't do it
again. What a bummer. Meryl died because of it.

<div class="entry-content">Over the past few days, I've played through Cave Story on the
PC. (It has recently been re-released in an updated form for
WiiWare.)

It has a very unique and fun mix of Mega Man, Metroid, and
Adventure-style game play. I played through the "Hard" version of
the game where you get Booster 2.0 and I played through the "Hell"
final area as well.

I highly recommend it. It is free to download and it's very
fun. It inspires me to work more often on my game ideas.

<div class="entry-content">After Final Fantasy 13, I wanted to play something really
light. Katamari Damacy was a good choice. It's crazy, bizarre, and
really fun. I've heard a lot about it over the past few years and
I was glad to be able to try it out.

I really like the way you collect countries in the ending
sequence. It's funny.

<div class="entry-content">Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... is an incredibly adorable romantic comedy. It
stars Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, with a supporting role for
Amitabh Bachchan. The songs were cute, but I was a bit let down by
the absence of traditional-style dances and costumes. The story was
great and I was on the edge of my seat, about to write the most
depressing LiveJournal entry ever, had the last plot twist not
happened.

Recommended.

<div class="entry-content">Raincoat, staring Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai, is straight drama,
something that I have not seen to date in a Bollywood (technically
``Tollywood'', that is, Bengali) movie. I enjoyed the acting and
the story, but Amanda didn't think it was /that/ good.

A review on IMDB writes that it is an ``art-house movie
obviously not for commercial consumption.'' I can recommend it if
you don't expect a cutesy movie.

<div class="entry-content">Chameli is a much shorter Bollywood movie than is typical. It is
has a different style -- a couple that doesn't quite connect and is
made of a prostitute and businessman, but nothing like the cuteness
of /Pretty Woman/. The story is surprising, but Amanda didn't like
it very much, although I enjoyed it.

It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose.

A note on the songs -- the one Kareena dances is good, but most of
the others are not so good. But, the dancing in the club is great,
although a bit too provocative for my tastes.

<div class="entry-content">Fida stars Kareena Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, and Jai Malhotra. Kareen
was amazing acting as a cold, heartless woman and was dressed very
well throughout the movie. Fardeen looked liked he was trying a bit
to hard to be "suave." And, Jai portrayed a man crumbling and going
mad very well, through his transition from being cutesy in love, to
crazy with pain.

The story was interesting, but seemed to happen a bit too
quickly.
