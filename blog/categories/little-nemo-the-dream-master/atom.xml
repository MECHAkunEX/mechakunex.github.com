    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about 30 minutes. It took me 5 minutes to
get passed level 1, then I spent the rest of the time in the next
level. I got no keys at all and could barely make any progress.</p>

<p>This game is so brutal. Nemo can't really jump over enemies, even
if he has stunned them with candy. Most of the animals have no
ability to hurt the enemies. It's so hard but you have no ways to
deal with it. It's not fun, despite the concept being great and
the general premise of turning into lots of different animals
sounds like it would be great. But, it doesn't follow through
enough.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have this cartridge and my son thinks the box art is cool. We
played today for a little and I beat the first level... which I
haven't done any of the last four or five times he's wanted to
see the game. I feel like it's a pretty brutal game, because most
animals (and Nemo) have no offense abilities.</p>
