    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few nights, I've played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren't done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I'm stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren't displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I'm not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I've seen, it isn't Treasure's best work, but I'm glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>
