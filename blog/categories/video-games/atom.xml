    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool "abilitease". I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I've
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn't realize it. But
now, it's quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It's cute so far though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for about an hour and a half. I beat three of the
Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can't dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a "bullet" is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn't get
passed the title screen... it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>
