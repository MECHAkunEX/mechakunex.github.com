    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the game... meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn't particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn't really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn't anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don't think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn't dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There's one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can't survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I did two side quests and I tried to do a third but was
totally destroyed. I hope it isn't too much longer, because it is
getting a little tired. Nothing really to say else about the
game play today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I finished getting As or above on every event in Pac-Man CE
DX. My ranking across the whole game is 5,100/245,281 or in the
top 2.07%. It's a really fun game. I think I like the normal mode
the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it's too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this for the first time tonight and my wife got a medal
on her first try at "Hole in One" (although she did watch me be
terrible at it for about 5 minutes.) Very fun.</p>
