    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror's
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.</p>

<p>The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can't believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I'm glad I'd at least run into her
before.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't been doing puzzles for about two months, so I decided to
start again today. So far, the story is very intriguing and the
Emmy character is funny. Normally these games take a while to get
to interesting puzzles, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I'm in an area
now with just one person in my group and it's quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I'm
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It's not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.</p>

<p>I'm finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven't
died since I restarted.</p>

<p>I made it through a bunch more areas (I'm about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don't know.) It's almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don't see
the global path so you don't get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn't find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
"side" quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places... kind
of a hole... that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting... the concept of remnants is neat. They're basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I'm just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don't understand how to optimize it,
so I'm just getting by.</p>
