    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and half this morning. I got stars in every
beginner event. I did 1-5 as Chang and I beat Isabella in Sudden
Death on the third hole. It was very intense. Also, in 1-5 I got
a crown. I haven't figured out how to find out what will give you
a crown though. Everything seemed a lot easier with Change
because he had so much power, but it also seems like the
characters aren't really supposed to be better than one-another,
but just represent different play styles. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played all night while chatting and burping my
new baby. I got stars up to 3-4 and did the Pro VS match twice. In
the first one, I lost after just a few holes and in the second I
had her tied until the second to last hole, then lost by one
stroke in the last. Ouch. It's a very fun game. But I might be
playing too much :/</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning we played for a bit more than an hour and beat the
game. I played through all of Wily's Fortress three times. The
first time I got stuck on the level before the triplicator
because I ran out of energy for the Rush Jet. The second time I
got to Wily but after continuing I didn't have any E-tanks or any
of the weapons I needed to kill him. The third time I won. It was
a brutal fight and I got really good at getting through the
fortress. I think this is a great game. Mega Man 2 is awesome,
but this is great too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for two and three quarter hours. I got stars in
1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. The game is very fun and I like the abstract
way it presents golf. I feel like I know nothing about golf, but
that I can do the game pretty well and have fun. One thing I
don't like though is that golf punishes mistakes soooo
heavily. Basically one mistake can cause you to get two or three
strokes behind and then you'll never get back. I went from being
1st in 1-4 to 13th in one hole and then ended in 19th because I
made another single mistake. It is brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I noticed today that I could download this for my Vita, since I
already bought it for the PS3 back in 2008, so I downloaded it
and showed it to my wife. I love the opening... fighting with
Richter and then the abilitease. It's great.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for a little more than thirty minutes. We got to
the final boss rush, but I didn't have enough skill to beat them,
and then when I got to the continue screen I accidentally
selected "Stage Select" rather than "Continue" so was put back at
the beginning of Wily's Castle. In frustration, I quit. I
understand why this option is there---so you can gave E
tanks. But I was very annoyed that it was default and it took so
long to restart the game back to where I was.</p>
