    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a lot today as I rested from being sick. There some
pretty memorable moments: I loved the joke about why one family
had been in charge of guarding the forbidden gate for so long. I
was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to say "No" to the
Count or console Callista... the romantic comedy structure is
really being forced on me. I find the establishment of Mirania as
this character with a weird "food" quirk to be pretty
hilarious. I'm still really enjoying this game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I showed this game to my son and got to block 3-2 on one
continue. I died once on Medusa, because I had been sloppy
earlier in the level and then the rest of the deaths came from
bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got past Vile, but had a heck of a time getting up the wall with
the flying platformers... it was so painful. I feel like I'm
really letting my kids down when they watch me and expect
awesomeness.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two and half hours and got back to the town. I
find it very charming how much this story is like Aladdin or a
romantic comedy. It was also neat how there was a monster
summoning spot right before a boss fight, almost like if you were
having trouble you could grind there, because the game is
normally very closed and linear. It's a neat structure.</p>

<p>TODO Go back to the mysterious island and go behind the entrance
where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again for about four hours. I got to the island and did
the two side quests there and then went to the Gurak base. I'm
really enjoying the flow of the story and the development of
Zael's &amp; Callista's relationship. I changed the combat controls
to Manual and I find it quite a bit more fun, even though I liked
it before. It is understandable, but I don't like that I can't go
to the arena right now... I am really strapped for cash and I
have a lot of upgrades I'd like to do. I think the narrator is a
really fun, cute little touch.</p>
