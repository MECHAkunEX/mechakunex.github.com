    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this in the morning and got to Great Tiger. I had a
tough time with Bear Hugger before I realized that I could duck
the Bear Hug. I only fought one round against Great Tiger, so I'm
just learning his patterns. It is interesting how this game is
almost, but not quite, identical to the NES version. There are
some things that are better and more convenient (like Saves and
Retry in the middle of a match) but other than that it's just
tweaked on the edges. It's cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played for about twenty minutes. We did the
Intro stage and then Chill Penguin. We got the dash and got to
the boss, but died on the first time and were out of lives. He
wanted to play Launch Octopus again so we did that had a tough
time with the ships before it was time for breakfast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I think I'm basically at
the end of the game. It was cool to play as Yasha at first,
although I was kind of disappointed I didn't get to play as
Berserker Asura. This game is totally nuts. Today I decided that
Deus looks like Ganon from Twilight Princess. Also, I think that
something I enjoy about this is how it is a lot like Bayonetta in
terms of its style and craziness. If only the action were as good
as Bayonetta, that would be awesome. But as it stands, the style
of the game is a really great substitute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for like 20 minutes. I've never played at Hot Shots
Golf game before, but I've been curious. The PS Vita bundle I
bought came with it, so I figured, what the heck. I played two
holes as Yuna. It was kind of fun.</p>
