    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight. I got to the gate of Prison
Island. The whole High Entia concept is pretty cool... especially
that there is this giant civilization that's totally disconnected
from others beneath it on the monster. The message at the Tomb was
very interesting too... I wonder what the ancestor's plans were
regarding the genetic destiny of their people?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd never played this game before, but I thought it might be
interesting for my son because you don't need to do very much. He
wasn't interested in trying it and I did the first 5 races. It
was really neat. I'm excited about playing through it when it
comes up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son wanted to see an "easy" game and I thought this might be a
good choice because its input space is so limited. He didn't
really understand it and wanted to switch to something else after
I lost.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played SMB1 and did levels 1-1 and 1-2. My son played
himself. He spend 5 lives running directly into the first Goomba
and cracking up. He thought it was sooo funny.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have this cartridge and my son thinks the box art is cool. We
played today for a little and I beat the first level... which I
haven't done any of the last four or five times he's wanted to
see the game. I feel like it's a pretty brutal game, because most
animals (and Nemo) have no offense abilities.</p>
