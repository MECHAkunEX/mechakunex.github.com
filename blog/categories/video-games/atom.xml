    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing this regularly for so long and I've never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've decided to retire this game for a while. I haven't really
been playing that much even though I have it scheduled and kind of
want to. I think I need to start again from the beginning with no
assists. I only have the Endurance Races, the Formula GT races,
and the Special Events to get Golds on, but I don't want to spend
the time on the Endurance ones and the Formula/Special events are
so technical, I think my skills just aren't up to the task. I
think I need to re-learn to play. I'm going to put it on my
schedule to play it again in January and give it another try. I
can't believe how much and how long I've played this game. It's
sooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn't have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they're just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.</p>

<p>Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak">A great review</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now... even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I'd like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I'm basically done with the game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had to wait around for a long time today, so I played for about
40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn't use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn't use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I'll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.</p>
