    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours today. I had to restart because my
save was lost somehow. I got to Portoa and got the Sword of
Water. (This appears to be about half-way by glancing at the Table
of Contents of a guide.)</p>

<p>The mechanics in the game never really get much more
interesting. They definitely add a few things: like the Rabbit
Boots, and presumably you eventually are able to cross water, and
then the keys that the swords become after you get their balls,
etc. But all the things that are different in the game are on the
level of navigation annoyances (not really "puzzles").</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that I'm opposed to games that don't change their
mechanics---Super Mario, for instance, doesn't have different
mechanics through the game. But, Mario can do this because (a) the
game play is awesome and (b) the game play is rich enough that it
supports gaining mastery and then increasing the challenge.</p>

<p>In my time playing Crystalis, it was very true to the literal
definition of "Action RPG". The individual encounters were totally
trivial (like hitting "Fight" over and over), but did require
moderate action. The challenge came from requiring a deep grind to
get resources---power to attack with and money to pay for healing
and rests. The severely limited inventory and the large number of
enemies really encourages you to go incredibly slowly and defeat
every enemy. But, it's not fun enough to do. It feels pretty good
for about an hour, but after that it gets really aggravating, and
I feel like I want to just rush by.</p>

<p>Something I'm surprised I was annoyed by was the need to switch
weapons to fight different kinds of enemies. It just felt so
tedious to do, because you generally want to walk around with a
sword charge, only to go to the menu to change swords when you
see an enemy. It was particularly annoying that you can't turn
off the bracelet power once you get it, so you have to either use
MP (because it's so easy to accidentally charge to level 3 shots)
or only use level 1 (by turning off the power-up altogether.)</p>

<p>I'd say that the game is not bad, but it has been so out-done by
games like Secret of Mana that there's no reason to play this
older Action RPG (as if Mana is really much newer!) I was hoping a
little that this would be much more Action-y because it was
older. It is interesting for me to notice that as I get older I
like more action-based games, because they cut away all that fat
from RPGs that I used to love.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played tonight for about 20 minutes. I played two continues on
Ring Man's stage and couldn't get much past the Hippo. My kids
then took two continues and just stayed on the first screen
running around and climbing up the later and using the super
shot. It was cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this today for 30 minutes at the request of my son. He
loves Mega Man a lot and always wants to play one. He's very
interested in fighting Skull Man, but I went Toad -> Bright ->
Pharaoh and then died during Ring Man's stage.</p>

<p>Something I dislike about Mega Man is the three lives system. On
a single level, it is a good idea, because it requires you to get
some mastery, rather than just sacrificing life to go
forward. The problem is that when you beat a boss on your last
life, the next level you start off with only the one life. This
encourages you to commit suicide at the start of the next level
(because there's no disadvantage to doing that... you keep your E
Tanks and all your equipment.) I don't like it when games have an
optimal strategy that is (a) un-fun, (b) trivial to execute, and
(c) trivial to have just programmed out of the game.</p>

<p>In any case, this game has lots of clever concepts in its
platforming.</p>

<p>In Toad Man's stage, the rain's ability to push you is very
challenging and the rushing water is also interesting. Fighting
the Giant Snail on the water-ridden platform was very nerve
racking.</p>

<p>In Bright Man's stage, the jumping grasshoppers were cool
(although really out of place) and the enemies that shut-out the
lights when you hit them was pretty crazy. The sequence before the
boss door where you had to jump from falling/sliding platform to
the next one while the light-putter-outers where moving around and
firing. It was nuts.</p>

<p>In Pharaoh Man's stage, the platforms then when you jump on them
start moving and then fall was cool. It was particularly
challenging because the next platform would shot at you just
before you were supposed to jump on to it and if you didn't jump
early enough, you would be shocked and fall to your death.</p>

<p>In Ring Man's stage (what I've seen so far), I like the platforms
that shift from side to side as you walk across them. In one
sequence if you dropped beneath one you could get a large health
charge, but you had to jump back up quickly or else you'd be
stuck. It's a great idea.</p>

<p>This game is a very creative Mega Man game that really does
something quite different every stage, rather than executing the
same set of mechanics really well. (It's not that I think the
normal Mega Man style is bad, but this is neat.) I've heard a lot
of griping about the charged shot, but I don't find it to be so
powerful that I have to keep it charged all the time (and thus
slow down the action.) Whenever I've done that, I think it has
hurt me more than it helped.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember playing this game as a kid and thinking it was cool. I
just remember that it is an Action RPG. I played today for an
hour with my son and we beat the first dungeon. It's very
fun. There's a little too much grinding... I feel like I can't
move forward and search, but I have to consciously try to get
money and EXP. But, it's fun. The charge shot is essential for
staying out of harm, but it makes you less flexible, so it's a
nice mechanic to put you in stressful situations.</p>
