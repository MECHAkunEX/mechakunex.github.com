    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today and a few weeks ago, I improved my score a bit. I am now
3,526/248,092, in the top 1.42%. I still have a few modes that are
not all As. I plan on getting all As and then eventually Ss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It's strange
that everyone talks about York's scar.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven't
really been captured by it. I'm not sure why. The combat system
doesn't seem as advanced as I'd like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I'll keep playing, but I'm a bit sad I
haven't been totally won over by it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched the first two episodes of the 100% playthrough. I really
like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn't yet done
what I did in the game, but he's done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
"Inn" to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.</p>

<p>In a small way I've been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There's just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.</p>

<p>I think doing one "episode" per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.</p>
