    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and got to the first boss of Anor
Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can't really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well... not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The episode we watched tonight was amazing because he said that he
played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It's amazing that he's
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!</p>
