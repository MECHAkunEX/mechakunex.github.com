    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for like 20 minutes. I've never played at Hot Shots
Golf game before, but I've been curious. The PS Vita bundle I
bought came with it, so I figured, what the heck. I played two
holes as Yuna. It was kind of fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for two hours tonight and got to 11.5. There were so
many absurd moments. I loved how Asura flew by punching the
ground and riding the shock wave. I loved the onsen sequence and
how Asura was denied. I loved how Augus and Asura are
inexplicably on the moon and how ridiculously huge Augus' sword
is (and how he's never drawn it but once). I loved the gigantic
crater from the sword and how Asura always ends up with no
arms. It's also very intriguing that Augus was robot-y too. What
could that mean?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours and beat the rest of the factory
levels. We discovered a way to grind for balloons but decided not
to. We traded our time for just using a cheat code that gives
infinite balloons. It's amazing how much more fun the game is
now, because we can play a little less cautiously and give my
wife more opportunities to do the difficult platforming sequences
where she used to just climb on my back. I think that might be
why we liked Mario so much more, because the Desert Life grind is
so effective.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I showed my wife the awesome Wyzen fight and then did the next
two episodes. The "ending" was cool and the awesome arm-less
fight. This game is just sooo ridiculous. I can tell my wife is
kind of appalled at how insane it is. I love that about it.</p>
