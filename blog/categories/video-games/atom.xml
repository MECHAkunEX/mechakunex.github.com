    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today and gave it another chance. This time, it was a
total breeze. I did die in the Amazon after spending $300k, which
was really painful, but I realized that if you just hold bounce
next to the statue, guys come and die under you without a chance
of getting hurt. This was totally boring and stupid (it took
a few minutes), but it wasn't horrific. After that, there was no
more grinding. The whole game was really short... just about an
hour from start to finish. The best part was the unique challenge
of not being able to directly jump on enemies and the way you
sometimes needed to whack things with your cane. (For example,
the mummy ducks in the mansion where fun to fight when you had to
whack their ball &amp; chain.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was fun... good music, cute monsters... and
it's classic in a certain sense, but I don't feel it is worth
replaying, because it is sooo easy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again today and gave a bigger chance. I was able to
accomplish somethings, including killing one of the bosses. I
still think the core gameplay is really sloppy---the hit boxes
are bad, the shot control isn't great, and the interface is
pretty whack. But, I can see why some people might have loved it
when it was released. I'm done with it though.</p>
