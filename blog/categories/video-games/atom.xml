    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried again. I lost against Honda the first try and then won in
the first round with my first knock down (it was interrupting his
special move.) I got a few hits on Soda Popinski, but then lost.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been watching more episodes and are now up to number 13,
when he introduced the L.P. Bot. The narrator is so funny. I can't
imagine "playing" this game any other way. It's such an efficient
way to see everything in the game, and he does a great job doing
things in an interesting order.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight. I explored the rest of
Sen's Fortress (or at least, I got to the boss) and then I
unlocked a shortcut to the boss, and then I tried to fight the
boss many many times. I could generally avoid almost every single
attack... occasionally I would get grabbed, but I could generally
heal myself. The main problem was that I kept getting knocked off
the tower by him. I probably fought him about 20 times. I explored
a number of different weapon options. Probably the best was
putting a Lightning enhancement on my Iaito, but I didn't have
enough to keep using it. Eventually I used the Drake Sword
(because Iaito's bleed didn't effect the Golem.) I won and it felt
real good. I explored the next area a tiny bit. I killed all the
Sentinels and got a level from that. I'm excited to be making
steady progress.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like two hours today. I fought and won against
Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen's Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I'm supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.</p>
