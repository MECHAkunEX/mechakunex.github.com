    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan's Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight... including all four bottles.</p>

<p>Total time: 4:43</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he'll play himself some day and I'll watch.</p>

<p>Total time: 2:57</p>

way, but kind of totally different. It's wild.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the last week I've been playing more than one puzzle a day
because I want to empty my queue. Tonight I played for a little
more two hours while watching YouTube videos. I did one of the
marble jump puzzles on my first try, it was awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote in my calendar to check on the DLC about six months after
I beat the game, when presumably it would all have been
released. It has. I looked for information about it and almost
none of it seems interesting, except Lightning's episode. But, I
found that it only takes about 25 minutes (including cut-scenes)
and that's not worth 5 bucks, so I just watched it. The new ending
is neat. I'm excited for 13-3. I love this battle system so much
and I find the world to be really cool too. I hope it can be
efficient for them to produce, make them lots of money, and make
FF15 amazing.</p>
