    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent some time grinding today (about an hour) and then got all
the Twinkling Shards I needed to fully upgrade my Giant armor and
the Giant's Hammer. It was pretty awesome once I did that. I then
fought the two bosses... I died the first time, but the second I
was more aggressive and got them down pretty quickly. After
getting the Lordvessel, I avenged the girl and advanced the
story. I feel like the end is in sight. I played for almost three
hours.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Go through New Londo Ruins + Abyss
- Upgrade Black Bow to +10 fire
- Upgrade Shield to +15
- Upgrade Murakumo to +10 fire and get the strength (28) to use it
- Fight the Black Hydra in Ash Lake
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Dragon Valley</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel's Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I'd
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn't kill him...). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave... which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain... and a major mistake to go down there. I think I'll
grind for souls and just buy them.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Get 10 + X? twinkling (10 total --- 4 3 2 1 --- per item, I have
4 armor pieces)
- Trade each of the three clumps to snuggly for shards (x4)
- Upgrade Giant Armor to +5
- Kill Giant Blacksmith to get Hammer
- Upgrade Hammer to +5 (need 10 Twinkling)
- Upgrade Black Bow to +5
- Go to Demon Ruins to get Fire Ember
- Upgrade Black Bow to +10 fire
- Upgrade Shield to +15
- Upgrade Murakumo to +10 fire and get the strength (28) to use it
- Fight the Black Hydra in Ash Lake
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Explore the rest of Sen's Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and a half today. I got to my goal stats and
then got a ton (60!) fire buff items. I went against the bosses
with Iaito + flame, but was totally creamed. Ouch. I'm wondering
what weapons I should try now. I think I will get Havel's Ring and
the Giant Blacksmith Hammer and go from there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I fought the Hydra and
boosted some levels, plus I found a new armor setup. I went to
fight the double bosses in Londo, but died both times I tried. The
second time, I got Ornstein down to one more hit before death. :(
I think I will try to upgrade my weapon to fire element... which
will be a bit of a trek.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the Darkroot Forest and killed the
boss and got some awesome equipment. At first when I tried to get
Pharis' bow, he fell off the cliff and so I didn't get it. But
later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot
higher because of the ring.</p>
