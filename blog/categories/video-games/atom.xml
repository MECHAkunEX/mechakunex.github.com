    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I've played
this many many times with other people... like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I've never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you're traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it's really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I'll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don't think it's strong enough to last on its own... but then
again, it's has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.</p>

boss, but died early in stage 2 and twice in stage 3 (before the
mid-boss.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since I've played this game and I'm not
really interested in trying it again. It's a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren't compelling enough to last much longer than I've
played. It's too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren't gravity puzzles, as far as
I've seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn't find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn't effectively do the "hit yourself" trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn't do that because I
didn't have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don't feel like you're getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I'm
curious about the story, but I'll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>
