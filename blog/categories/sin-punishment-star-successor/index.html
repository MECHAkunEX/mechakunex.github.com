<div class="entry-content">I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn't move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don't think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.

got him down to 238 but didn't get the final two charge shots

is this was my first round with him today; a few days ago I played
S&P for about 30 or 40 minutes playing this fight over and over
with no success. (FYI, I normally just play one round.)

  <h2>2010</h2>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/03/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2010--1/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2010) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Sin & Punishment 2, I haven't played it
commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.

Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I've completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&Kachi. I've 1CC'd every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.

Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&Kachi. So rad.

Since I've been playing again, I've thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I've thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.

It is a really remarkable game.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/29/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2010--0/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I got Sin & Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.

/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.

The best reviews of this game are...
<blockquote><p>Here's the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>"YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure's latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>

And...

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>...</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>

The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.

The only problem with the game, for me, is that I'm a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can "Save & Quit" without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won't score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.

my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I'd like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I've seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don't need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
