of Novice Normal for my son. He really enjoys the animations and
all the enemies. It is so much fun to just blast away in this
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I'd comment on it more than my original post.</p>

<p>I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it's a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.</p>

<p>It's hard to express what I like about it. There's so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>So far I've been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC</p>

<p>I'm now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I've been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I'll get better though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)</p>

<p>I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc'd the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the <a href="http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=23025">shmups forum</a>
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.</p>

<p>So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.</p>

<p>Here's a YouTube link to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=mushih">videos of the game</a>. It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I played the next day and one life'd it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.</p>
