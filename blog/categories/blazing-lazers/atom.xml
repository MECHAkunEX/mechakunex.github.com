    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through Blazing Lazers a few nights ago and tonight. This
is a shooter from 1989 on the PC Engine.</p>

<p>I found the weapons to be really cool. I particularly liked the
laser beam weapon that spread into weird shapes.</p>

<p>I found the hit box really annoying. The hit box is bigger than
the ship graphic and wider than it is vertically, so it is really
difficult to dodge properly, at least when compared to the modern
danmaku shooters I normally play.</p>

<p>I used save states before and after bosses, plus throughout the
final boss battle. In fact, my wife helped me restart a million
times through a particular explosion.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the game was fun, but I like modern shooters
better. I didn't like it as much as the shooter that is in Retro
Game Challenge, which is supposedly based on this game.</p>
