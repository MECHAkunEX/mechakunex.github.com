    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.</p>

<p>This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.</p>

<p>The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It's a blast to play. I'd like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)</p>

<p>I have three problems with the game.</p>

<p>First, the controllers aren't precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that's required.</p>

<p>Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.</p>

<p>Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.</p>

<p>But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.</p>
