    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the last little bit, I played and beat this for the
Nintendo GBA. This is definitely a good entry in the Castlevania
franchise. I really appreciated the variety that came from the
Soul system, but I felt like it had a problem that many RPGs with
these "collecting" systems: most of the things you collect are
totally useless. This game had two other problems in my mind:
first, the difficulty curve had a really sharp spike at one point
which required me to grind for almost two hours to get past a
boss; and second, the user interface was really poor and that
complicated switching souls quickly to navigate around the
map. Both of these were fixed in the next entry; in particular the
Doppelganger soul allowed you to have two equipment sets
readied.</p></p>

<p>I will definitely play this again as the secret character, so
maybe I'll report back then.</p>
