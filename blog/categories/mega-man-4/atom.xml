    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the day, I played this and beat Ring Man and
Dust Man. Ring Man's level was quite difficult and Dust Man was
really tough to fight himself.</p>

<p>At night, I went through the rest of the game and beat it. I
found this game to be much much harder than the other ones. I
think one thing that made it so difficult was that when you died
against a boss in the Wily stages, you had to do the end of the
level again. The 2nd form of the Wily Machine was really
brutal. It took me so long to even be able to hit him at all. I
watched a few YouTube videos and still couldn't do it. I think it
took about 45 minutes of fighting over and over again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through Skull Man's stage tonight (my son is very
fascinated with his appearance.) It was a fun level and I managed
to get an E tank and lots of 1-UPs on it. I had 4 lives for the
boss fight but was totally destroyed. I feel like in these later
Mega Man games, it is impossible to beat bosses out of
order. It's a bit disappointing that it isn't as free, but it
doesn't detract that much from the experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played tonight for about 20 minutes. I played two continues on
Ring Man's stage and couldn't get much past the Hippo. My kids
then took two continues and just stayed on the first screen
running around and climbing up the later and using the super
shot. It was cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this today for 30 minutes at the request of my son. He
loves Mega Man a lot and always wants to play one. He's very
interested in fighting Skull Man, but I went Toad -> Bright ->
Pharaoh and then died during Ring Man's stage.</p>

<p>Something I dislike about Mega Man is the three lives system. On
a single level, it is a good idea, because it requires you to get
some mastery, rather than just sacrificing life to go
forward. The problem is that when you beat a boss on your last
life, the next level you start off with only the one life. This
encourages you to commit suicide at the start of the next level
(because there's no disadvantage to doing that... you keep your E
Tanks and all your equipment.) I don't like it when games have an
optimal strategy that is (a) un-fun, (b) trivial to execute, and
(c) trivial to have just programmed out of the game.</p>

<p>In any case, this game has lots of clever concepts in its
platforming.</p>

<p>In Toad Man's stage, the rain's ability to push you is very
challenging and the rushing water is also interesting. Fighting
the Giant Snail on the water-ridden platform was very nerve
racking.</p>

<p>In Bright Man's stage, the jumping grasshoppers were cool
(although really out of place) and the enemies that shut-out the
lights when you hit them was pretty crazy. The sequence before the
boss door where you had to jump from falling/sliding platform to
the next one while the light-putter-outers where moving around and
firing. It was nuts.</p>

<p>In Pharaoh Man's stage, the platforms then when you jump on them
start moving and then fall was cool. It was particularly
challenging because the next platform would shot at you just
before you were supposed to jump on to it and if you didn't jump
early enough, you would be shocked and fall to your death.</p>

<p>In Ring Man's stage (what I've seen so far), I like the platforms
that shift from side to side as you walk across them. In one
sequence if you dropped beneath one you could get a large health
charge, but you had to jump back up quickly or else you'd be
stuck. It's a great idea.</p>

<p>This game is a very creative Mega Man game that really does
something quite different every stage, rather than executing the
same set of mechanics really well. (It's not that I think the
normal Mega Man style is bad, but this is neat.) I've heard a lot
of griping about the charged shot, but I don't find it to be so
powerful that I have to keep it charged all the time (and thus
slow down the action.) Whenever I've done that, I think it has
hurt me more than it helped.</p>
