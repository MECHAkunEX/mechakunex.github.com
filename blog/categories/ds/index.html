<div class="entry-content">I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and "camera" changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.

Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.

I can't tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don't feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.

I don't think I'd play it again, because I'm willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark... which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would've only last one
hit... and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.

After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an "accurate" polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &
their speed.) That would be funny.

Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There's a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to "fetch questy", but when you actually have
to remember what's going on, it feels more real and fun. It's an
interesting thing.

Here's my list: 
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff

<div class="entry-content">I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn't go to before. I like it when things like that work out.

boss. It's nice how bite-sized this game can be. I'm really
hurting for cash in the game though and I don't want to grind for
it right now. I'd much rather grind to be able to go "deeper" into
some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.

world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the "best" choice and keep all the characters balanced.

quest. So far it is intriguing. It is a little bit annoying to
take another group from level 1, especially when they don't have
new attributes (they're just a healer and a mage, like the
companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.

<div class="entry-content">I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.

Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.

<div class="entry-content">I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn't read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn't select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I'd never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time... which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn't.

<div class="entry-content">The last puzzle game I played each day was Professor Layton and
the Unwound Future. I started on July 28th and I finished the main
story by December 28th and then completed all the optional content
yesterday.

This is easily the best story of any of the Layton games I've
played. The puzzles are definitely on par with the
others. Although I must say that I feel like there were more
"action" puzzles where you play a little puzzle-like mini-game. I
like these quite a bit, actually.

Very great game.

<div class="entry-content">I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.

It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.

There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn't check who you needed to
still visit.

All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.

<div class="entry-content">For approximately the last year, I've been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a "Perfect" score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.

I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.

The story was incomprehensible to me after about 5 scenes and it
took too long to read, so I started skipping it, but that seems
like a bad decision in retrospect.

It is very hard to tell how good your decisions are for the long
run

Some of the controls are really bad---like turning your knights

I don't yet understand how height works because, for example, magic
users can't seem to launch projectiles "down" even though that
makes sense

<div class="entry-content">I played through WarioWare: Touched! and had a chance with all of
the games. It is really fun, just like /WarioWare: Smooth Moves/
for the Wii.

This is the perfect game for someone with ADD, especially once
you unlock the Megamix and can sit on one screen and go through
the whole variety of games. I really enjoyed the retro games, but
I was a little annoyed when the control was really different than
the original game, because I felt stupid being so bad at them
initially. I thought the mic-based games were all very lazy and
easily the worst part of the game. my wife and I played the
Ping-Pong game, which was an incredibly clever use of the dual
screens of the DS.

Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot; I'll keep it around to play
whenever I need something quick to fool around with.

<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the
DS. I'd never played a game in this series before and it's been a
long time since I've played a tactical game like this---although
/Devil Survivor/ was definitely tactically-inspired.

I really enjoyed the game. I especially liked how hard it
felt. I think I only lost two or three missions (but beat them on
the second try), but for nearly all the missions after the
tutorial levels, I felt pushed to my limit and nearly losing. I
like that sensation, because it keeps the game very exciting.

During the majority of the time I played the game, I would make my
moves for a round, and then I would go do something else (like
practicing Japanese) and then look back when it was my turn
again. It was amazing to me how long it would often take before I
could take a turn again. I consider this a problem with the game,
although it worked out for good in my case because I was glad to
be getting something else done as well without giving it my total
focus.

Perhaps my favourite thing about the game was how by the end, I
was regularly using almost all the features of the combat. This
suggests to me that the mechanics are well-designed and actually
useful.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/12/16/Game--Mario-and-Luigi--Partners-in-Time--DS--2005--0/">Game: Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time (DS, 2005)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-12-16T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time for the DS.

Ever since Super Mario RPG, I've liked the idea of a Mario-based
RPG, especially because of the action-based combat. I played Super
Paper Mario when I first got a Wii and enjoyed it a lot, but I
hadn't played any of the portable Mario and Luigi games. I heard a
lot of good things about Bowser's Inside Story, so I decided to
play this game in preparation.

Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable, but with a few
big flaws.

First, the dialogue is hilarious and ridiculous. There were many
times when I stopped, found my wife, and told her some of the great
lines. Second, the battle system was initially extremely
fun. Fighting each different enemy actually /feels/ different, as
opposed to a traditional turn-based RPG where you may use
different strategies, but what you're doing feels the same. I'm
very impressed that they were able to do that.

I was not excellent at avoiding the enemies' attacks (you can
counter or dodge basically every attack against you), so I got
hammered a lot. This made me notice that average monsters would do
damage equal to about a third of your total health on every
attack. Since the players are normally out-numbered, this meant
that you could be KO'd in a single round on almost every battle if
you didn't dodge. I don't think I was under-leveled, because I was
able to get so far in the game. This was really obnoxious to me,
because I didn't feel it fit the light-hearted tone of the game
and there were not very good ways to practice. (For example, it
takes about 2 minutes to get back into a fight after dying,
quitting, loading, etc; and I never found any "Heart Blocks" next
to a field where monsters were.)

A related problem was that it seemed like monsters had
extremely high health counters. For example, near when I quit, I
would regularly fight groups of 4 or 5 monsters, each with 170 HP
and I was able to do about 31 HP of damage each round with each
character. Each battle took almost 13 rounds---and that's only if
I was able to dodge every attack and not have to heal. I don't
think I'm that bad at games, so I find it easier to blame the
game.

The problem, however, is probably that after about 6 or 7
hours, I got really tired of the incredibly long and frustrating
battles, so I tried to avoid them as much as possible. I---as a
hardened RPG player---should have known better. If you avoid
combat, then you won't level as much, so you won't be able to
compete against bosses and other enemies, which spawns more
dodging, but now for necessity, etc. This was a bad strategy
because it really exacerbated my dislike of the game.

If I design a game with experience like this, I will have to
make a point of ensuring that the player cannot dig themselves
into a hole like this. One technique is to use a field-enemy
system like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy XIII where generally
enemies can only be avoided in "traversal" segments rather than
"dungeon" segments; and then control the pacing of combat through
that means.

On Tuesday, I had a particularly horrendous battle. I fought B&BB
(no spoilers). I started playing at the beginning of my student's
final that started at 11am and got to the fight in about 15
minutes (not sure exactly.) The final was three hours and one
student made use of all the time. I beat the battle at 1:45pm. I
was in the battle for almost two hours! I couldn't believe it!
This is supposed to a /portable/ game, as well. (You also cannot
pause in battle, which I find very odd.)

Last night, I was 12 hours into the game, at level 18, at the
fifth to last boss (according to a walkthrough), and getting
unbelievably pummeled. I decided that life is too short to play
games I don't love. I walked away.

I'm still going to play Inside Story, but I probably will not
come back to this game.

<div class="entry-content">I just beat N+ for the DS.

Death stats in row-column order: 0, 37, 156, 443, 0, 110, 54, 2054
(bombs), 4 (clock), 4, 231, 134 (falling); Total: 3223.

Gold: 20323

This is an amazing 2D platforming game. It requires a lot of
precision and skill. I played it when I first got my DS, but
didn't spend a lot of time on it (in fact, I don't think I beat
the first episode.) But, I was reminded of it by Podcast 198x when
they compared it to Super Meat Boy, which I just got on XBLA. So,
since I'm DS-bound, I decided to play it.

I beat all the episodes and all the levels (I think there's
about 250.) The satisfaction I get from this game is shmup like:
you have an incredibly difficult challenge that you tackle bit by
bit---getting a little bit further in the level each time. It's a
great feeling to defeat something so difficult.

The game is incredibly exhilarating too. For example, there are
sentries that target you with their lasers and fire. You can see
the cross-hair starting to follow you and lock-on (it turns red
when it does); my heart races when I am avoiding laser
fire. Similarly, there are heat-seeking missiles that get on your
tail and it is a blast to avoid them.

The game is more physics-based than most platformers I've
played. A lot of levels require a certain amount of momentum to
get passed segments; gravity is actually acceleration rather than
velocity; etc. This makes an interesting challenge.

The game has perfect control. I can't think of anything that
could be better about it.

I think the only thing the game lacks is kickin music. I know
there was music, but it is totally forgetable.

Overall, amazing game: A+

Here's a video that gives a good taste of the game and one of the
hardest levels: [Episode 38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYVr3GpBIHM).

<div class="entry-content">Since the flood, I haven't been able to play my normal game
regime. I decided to play a DS game, since that still works. I
picked up Nostalgia.

This game is great. It is basically Indiana Jones the RPG. The
alternate history world is really fun. The battle system is
straight-forward and classic, but still fun. The skill system is
interesting, although I didn't find it that necessary to actually
use the skills much. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot.

The main problem is that after 12 hours, I had to stop because
I hit a well-known glitch in the game that stops your
progression. I read a few people on forums talking about the
problem and having to return the game, etc. Very disappointing,
but it was a fun experience while it lasted.

<div class="entry-content">On the plane ride back from New England for Thanksgiving, I beat
New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS.

I started playing the game in August 2009 on a trip to Oregon
for a wedding, but I hit a wall in my progress after the second
tower in World 6. It was very frustrating, so I only played it
occasionally (less than monthly), basically whenever I was bored
and had a few moments. On the ride out to Boston this year, I did
exactly that. And again as I was sitting around with my family one
night. Then. I beat the level! I played regularly the rest of the
trip and by the flight home, I'd beaten it.

Most of my opinion of the game revolve around the last World
and my painful experience with the progress wall. Obviously it is
very frustrating not to make any progress. I think the biggest
problem was that even when I could beat a level, you are
restricted from saving until after a tower or castle, so you had
to have a successful string and a long time to play to make
progress. NSMBW solved this problem with the Quick Save system,
although I see no reason to not have Save anywhere unlocked from
the beginning. The final level's maze was really frustrating---I
made it there over 10 times and tried different patterns over and
over again, running out of time and then lives each time, before
looking it up online (which was a miracle, because I was on a
plane.)

I thought the physics in the game after more off than NSMBW. I
thought that the additional power-ups were mostly all dumb.

But, I love platformers and Mario in particular, so it was
really fun, especially when you're on a roll.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/08/Game--Dragon-Quest-9--DS--2010--0/">Game: Dragon Quest 9 (DS, 2010)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.

I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.

I guess I didn't finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing---I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the "Time = Progress" equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn't worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn't going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.

Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.

The character progression system was fun---on the surface---it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone's class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn't love it enough
to really get into that.

I pretty much ignored the "quests" because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn't do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don't
love the game, I'm not taking advantage of it.

I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren't really for the solo player I
typically am.

The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I've briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.

Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn't really pay of either.

On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.

I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character's appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It's funny how
close it goes to the JRPG cliché of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.

Overall, I don't regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I'll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/26/Game--Etrian-Odyssey--DS--2007--0/">Game: Etrian Odyssey (DS, 2007)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.

I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).

# Things I liked

I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.

I like the art style.

I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: "There is a dungeon
outside the town."), it's natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn't often that I could "phone it in" and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.

I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you're
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can't defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)

I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)

# Things I didn't like

The mapping system isn't advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something---like the link between a
portal's entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way---where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn't be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.

The character customization didn't have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn't upgrade everything (there just aren't enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn't exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.

I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn't bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst
enemy and I wasn't making enough improvement after a few weeks of
sporadic play.

<div class="entry-content">While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five "acts" of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.

I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.

Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don't invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you'll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.

The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you'd want
to buy, so it just accumulates.

The story is interesting but there isn't anything too special
about it.

The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn't use it.

Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn't I quit.

<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I've decided to stop
playing because I've been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.

The gameplay is great: it's a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
"catch-them-all" with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it's the first I've
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can "crack".

The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn't
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn't realize that you could
change a character's skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn't the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.

The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.

However, there are a few key points where if you've done every
single battle before them and you've cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won't be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.

Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/22/Game--Retro-Game-Challenge--DS--2009--0/">Game: Retro Game Challenge (DS, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">While I was on my tour, I played through most of Retro Game
Challenge and just completed the last challenge (beat all the
games) tonight. This game is incredibly brilliant.

The premise is that a demon version of a Japanese video game
playing TV star has sent you back into the 80s to challenge you
with old Famicom-style video games. You are presented with a game
and four challenges, when you complete most challenges you get a
new issue of a game magazine and when you complete all of them you
get another game and more challenges. Each game has an illustrated
manual. The game magazines are hilarious, because they will
preview games that you'll be unlocking soon, they'll report that a
game has been delayed, and they have a top 5 chart with hilarious
parody titles. When you play a game, it runs in to the top screen
of the DS, while on the bottom you see two kids sitting in front
of a TV playing. I love that the friend makes comments about how
you're playing as you do. It is hilarious.

The games are great too:
- *Cosmic Gate* - This is a Galaga-like fixed-screen shooter. It
is simple, but fun.
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man* - This is a single screen platformer,
like Bubble Bobble, although you throw ninja stars to stun
things. The main mechanic is going in "doors" that hurt the
enemies and protect you from damage. This isn't my favourite
game, but it is enjoyable.
- *Rally King* - A racing game like RC Pro Am. The cool part is
the drift mechanic. I'm not a huge fan of racers, so when I beat
this game for the final challenge I used invincibility.
- *Star Prince* - A straight-forward vertically scrolling
shooter. The weapon selection is great and the hidden bonus
items are fun to find. You get a special controller to play this
game which turns your Y button into a rapid-fire. One of my
favourite subtleties is that you fire faster the closer you are
to the top of the screen (which is dangerous.)
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2* - This game plays just like its
predecessor, although it is considerably more difficult and the
final boss is very interesting.
- *Rally King SP* - The same game as its predecessor but with new
graphics. The levels are the same, etc. This is a promotional
game for the game magazine and a soup company. Very funny.
- *Guadia Quest* - A Dragon Quest-style JRPG. A fun mechanic is
that you can capture strong enemies and they will fight for
you. It was very fun to play this old school RPG.
- *Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3* - This is a reboot of the Robot Ninja
Haggle Man series with new graphics and gameplay. The gameplay
and graphics are incredibly reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden,
although the colors pop a lot more than the original NES Ninja
Gaidens. In addition to that core gameplay, there is a
customization system reminiscent of Super Metroid. This is a
little bit of exploration as well, but the levels are mostly
linear.

My favourite games were Star Prince, Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3, and
Guadia Quest.

I /highly/ recommend this one.

<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch---you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.

The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don't really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn't actually
feel like a shooting game.

This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.

<div class="entry-content">In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn't start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.

I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.

It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that's how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction "mysteries" are simply crazy
things you can't possible know until they come out of left
field. I'm glad this game wasn't like that.

I'm definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.

<div class="entry-content">Of the past two-ish months, I've played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It's kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.

It's a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It's quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don't get as many
lives/bombs during it.)

I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn't registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)

Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540

Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)
Extra =

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/17/Game--Castlevania--Order-of-Ecclesia--DS--2008--0/">Game: Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-17T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>17</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing this. Castlevania... how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:

The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She's beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn't fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she's wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she's absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.

The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated... I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.

The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits... some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That's something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and "makes sense". This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula's Castle it is huge.

The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.

The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.

The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don't
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game's combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn't really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops---like Arma Felix, so cool!)

I recommend this game, no reservations!

<div class="entry-content">During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The "vibe" system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn't proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn't about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn't finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you're in for some frustration and annoyance.

<div class="entry-content">During my last trip, I played through this game. I thought the
environment was really fresh relative to the last few Castlevania
games I've played and I enjoyed the partner system a lot, although
I felt like I didn't have as much use for *REDACTED*lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I'm really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don't think I will for a while.

My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn't beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn't finish the game.

<div class="entry-content">After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I'd actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn't touched
it since.

I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.

There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.
