    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn't go to before. I like it when things like that work out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 30 minutes today and did a dungeon and a
boss. It's nice how bite-sized this game can be. I'm really
hurting for cash in the game though and I don't want to grind for
it right now. I'd much rather grind to be able to go "deeper" into
some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about five hours today during my looong travel
home. I got to the hero's story and I'm finding it a little
confusing compared to what came before because so much of the
world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the "best" choice and keep all the characters balanced.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little bit tonight and started the twin sister's
quest. So far it is intriguing. It is a little bit annoying to
take another group from level 1, especially when they don't have
new attributes (they're just a healer and a mage, like the
companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.</p>

<p>Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.</p>
