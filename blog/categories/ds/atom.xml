    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been plugging along in the game doing one a day. I got the
train mini-game today. It's a neat version of the car mini-game
from the last one. The idea of dealing with multiple trains at a
time sounds like it will be challenging.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There's a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to "fetch questy", but when you actually have
to remember what's going on, it feels more real and fun. It's an
interesting thing.</p>

<p>Here's my list:
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn't go to before. I like it when things like that work out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 30 minutes today and did a dungeon and a
boss. It's nice how bite-sized this game can be. I'm really
hurting for cash in the game though and I don't want to grind for
it right now. I'd much rather grind to be able to go "deeper" into
some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about five hours today during my looong travel
home. I got to the hero's story and I'm finding it a little
confusing compared to what came before because so much of the
world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the "best" choice and keep all the characters balanced.</p>
