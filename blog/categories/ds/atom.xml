    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 30 minutes today and did a dungeon and a
boss. It's nice how bite-sized this game can be. I'm really
hurting for cash in the game though and I don't want to grind for
it right now. I'd much rather grind to be able to go "deeper" into
some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about five hours today during my looong travel
home. I got to the hero's story and I'm finding it a little
confusing compared to what came before because so much of the
world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the "best" choice and keep all the characters balanced.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little bit tonight and started the twin sister's
quest. So far it is intriguing. It is a little bit annoying to
take another group from level 1, especially when they don't have
new attributes (they're just a healer and a mage, like the
companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer "trips" as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.</p>

<p>Torneko's chapter was really strange because you're trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you're doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn't read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn't select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I'd never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time... which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn't.</p>
