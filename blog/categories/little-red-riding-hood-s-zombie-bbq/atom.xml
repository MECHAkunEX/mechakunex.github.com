    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch---you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don't really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn't actually
feel like a shooting game.</p>

<p>This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.</p>
