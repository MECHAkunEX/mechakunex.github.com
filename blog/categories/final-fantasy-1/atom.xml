    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.</p>

<p>Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn't have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn't
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.</p>

<p>This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest... some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can't comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.</p>
