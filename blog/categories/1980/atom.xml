    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second Kurosawa film that I've seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
"psychedelic" scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>
