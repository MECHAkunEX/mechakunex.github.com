    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan's Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight... including all four bottles.</p>

<p>Total time: 4:43</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he'll play himself some day and I'll watch.</p>

<p>Total time: 2:57</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for a little more than an hour. We got to the Dark
World and got the first crystal. I beat the boss that was giving
me such a hard time before on the first try. It was cool. I
decided to keep track of my time from now on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago... I forget when... we played again, beat the first
temple and got some items in the world. My son really enjoys
watching it.</p>

<p>Today we played up to the boss in the Tower of Hera, but were
totally creamed. It is tough. I keep getting knocked off and then
his health is reset.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, "Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?" He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn't move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

<p>We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.</p>
