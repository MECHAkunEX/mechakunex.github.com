    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I showed this game to my son and got to block 3-2 on one
continue. I died once on Medusa, because I had been sloppy
earlier in the level and then the rest of the deaths came from
bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We got through Ganon's tower today with 2 blue potions and 2
fairies. We lost the last fairy in the fight versus Agahnim, which
we entered with only three hearts. After that, I fought Ganon,
but failed to use a potion after using a fairy, then filled up
again and won. Woot!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again for two hours with my son paying good attention for
the first half. I beat dungeons six and seven, then started
Ganon's Tower, but didn't do too much of it. I also got the Golden
Sword and Silver Arrows and the 1/2 magic thing. This is such a
great game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan's Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight... including all four bottles.</p>
