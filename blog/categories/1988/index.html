<h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/28/Game--Dragon-Warrior-3--NES--1988--4/">Game: Dragon Warrior 3 (NES, 1988) (5)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-01-28T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>28</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played through Dragon Warrior 3 over the past week and a half.

My opinions on this game are very similar to DW1 and DW2. This
much more mechanically strong that DW2 but not as much of a leap
as DW2 was over DW1. I enjoyed the class changing system.

I used anti-grinding Game Genie codes to limit the amount I had to
do it---one gave me more XP and the other more GP. The combat
system gets pretty old, especially with random monsters. Fighting
the bosses is typically really fun.

I also played with a guide, so I didn't have to figure out where I
needed to go myself, but I got the impression that it was much
less obscure than DW2, but not as clear as even a SNES-era game.

For these two reasons, I definitely didn't get a true DW3
experience, although I'm willing to bet that I wouldn't want that
experience. Instead, I just enjoyed the story.

The connection to the other games is easily the coolest part of
this and really comes out of nowhere, but makes complete sense
after the fact. I thought it was also really cool how you run into
your father right at the end. It's really neat.

I'm looking forward to the first truly played DW game.

<div class="entry-content">I played up to 2-1, at which point I had to deal with the really
floaty downward motion of the character. It's really awkward to

turning enemies into bubbles so you can ride them and/or attack
other characters is very clever and would work in almost any other
platformer I think.

<div class="entry-content">Over the last week, I played through Super Mario
Bros. 3.

The first two nights I played three worlds and then the others
took a night each. I used Game Genie codes that allow you to start
at a specific world as a form of password. I also used an infinite
lives password so I didn't have to repeat levels, but had to get
through every level as-is. I did not skip any levels.

This is a really amazing game. Although SMB2 defined SMB for me,
when I played SMB3 it really expanded what was possible. Truly a
masterpiece. It makes my thumb hurt from holding down the run
button though. :)

<div class="entry-content">I played through the first three or four areas of The Guardian
Legend.

I was very interested in this game because of its shooter and
Metroid-vania mixed gameplay. But it was a little bit of a let
down.

The shooter parts were pretty mediocre in my mind, but I think
they were probably pretty standard and reasonable for NES shooters
of the era. The main problem with it was that it felt totally
disconnected from the rest of the game. I was hoping that it would
be integrated more.

The exploration was fun seemed to really matter and be
meaningful. I would quibble that I think the map presentation
could have been better, but I can look at it as a product of its
time.

The action was basically the same as the walking areas in Blaster
Master. Almost a Zelda perspective but projectile based. It wasn't
very appealing to me. I can recognize that it was solid, but it
didn't have the special something that capture my attention.

Overall, it's not a game I plan on going back to, but it wasn't a
waste of time to try out for a while.

<div class="entry-content">After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).

This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options---choosing different characters---is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)

I can't believe this wasn't originally a Mario game and wasn't
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.

I also use Peach by the way, she's the best.

<div class="entry-content">I'm going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn't crazy about it.

I'm not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I've played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can't deal
with it.

The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.

This was a super retro-goggle game. I didn't like it at all, but I

I found the controls to be really sloppy and the game to be too
slow. This is definitely a common complaint I have, but I want

This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,

Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.

<div class="entry-content">This afternoon I played Contra on the Famicom.

I played for about an hour and got to the end of the third stage
reliably, but couldn't take care of the boss fast enough. I played
the Japanese version so I could use stage select and start from
the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the
game. This effectively gives you infinite continues if you are
honest about not going past the point that you've gotten before. I
like infinite continue systems, provided the time in between
continue points is sufficient large. I feel like a lot of newer
games have such tiny checkpoint stretches that you can just plow
through. I realized that the reason I want to 1CC shmups is
because when you continue you start from exactly where you were
rather than the beginning of the level, so it feels really cheap
to do so.

After deciding to put it down for the day, I decided to play the
US version and use an infinite lives Game Genie code so I could
quickly play through the whole game and remember what all the
stages were like. (Since you begin a new life exactly where you
were, this allows you to plow through any problem.) It was nice to
remember what everything was like. The noises during the snow
stage were very memorable, as were the sounds of blowing up the
spiked walls in the factory.

This game is very tight and has a lot of friction, which is really
good, especially compared to some of the games that haven't stood
up very well. It's a solid game, but I think it has a few
problems. The major one is that it so wedded to the wrong arcade
sensibilities... namely cheap kills to get more
quarters. Nevertheless, this is definitely an optimal path through
most levels. For example, after a dozen or so tries, I could get
through the third stage without getting hit once. (Of course, the
boss trounced me.) I remember this game being great to play with a
friend, although in retrospect it has some bad co-op attributes:
you can kill your friend by scrolling the screen and you can too
easily steal their upgrade. Given these, I'm not sure I really
would want to play it with someone, because I wouldn't want to
make them mad.

Overall, I'm not sure I would play the game again or invest the
time to get past stage 3 honestly. The main reason is that it just
isn't a joy to play. It's fun, but it's not the giddy kind of fun
that a Mega Man 2 or Bayonetta is. It just isn't the
Ur-Run-n-Gun.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Blaster Master tonight after getting home from
Thanksgiving in SLC.

I had fond memories of reading about this game in Nintendo Power
and seeing the box art many many times. However, I don't remember
ever playing it. It's funny, I've always thought of it as a game I
played, but when I stretch, I realize I can't remember any
details. Another funny thing happened related to this game
recently. Just last night a student asked me if I knew the name of
the game with the kid and his frog that jumps in a
hole. Naturally, I said "Blaster Master!" And then I played it the
next day.

The game was very fun. The platforming is very simple. It's more
of a combat game. However, the combat is not really twitchy or
skillful. It is more a matter of being patient and taking each
enemy one at a time. I thought that I would appreciate the
"Metroid"-ness about it. But, although there is a back-tracking
and an open world. The upgrades you get feel like "keys" that are
only used once, rather than enhancements of your abilities that
you use all the time. That's a weak way to have a system like
this. Perhaps the worst part is that the final upgrade makes the
jumping feel totally off, wrong, and hard to do right because you
accidentally go under the platform you are on. The bosses are
really really hard and in most cases I resorted to dirty tricks to
get them... like going into a place where I could hit them but
they couldn't hit me. Some it was pure luck.

Nevertheless, I do stick by the game being fun, and although I
don't think I'd play it again, I would recommend it.

<div class="entry-content">I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
"hang" of it.

The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn't remember was that it really
isn't much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There's basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.

I can't say that this will go on the same "Play it again" list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.

<div class="entry-content">Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don't
remember ever beating the game.

I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn't work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.

I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can't think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley's Castle
today.

I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don't
remember ever getting to Wiley's Castle, and especially not
through it. I'm kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don't normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I'm just remembering it being harder than
it was? I'm not sure.

Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man's
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.

Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don't
think there's anything that isn't polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.

This game is amazing.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/23/Game--Ninja-Gaiden--NES--1988--0/">Game: Ninja Gaiden (NES, 1988)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content">I've just finished Ninja Gaiden for the NES. It was great to use
an authentic controller for it. It was also great to be able to
use save states because the game is so hard.

I really like the simple and straight-forward controls. I love
the arcade/shmup-like patterns and difficulties. Even though with
modern games, I loathe lame cut-scenes over boring stories, I find
them really entertaining in this game, because they are so
simplistic. The music and sound-effects overall are nice, in that
8-bit way.

For the first four acts (there are six), I limited myself to
one save state per screen. This was a significant challenge. When
I got to the fifth act, it was so tough that I was tempted by the
save states and used them after each obstacle. Each of the final
bosses (there are three) was defeated by using a save after each
hit I landed. Nevertheless, I feel very satisfied that I have been
able to get through the game, because even severely disadvantaging
it, it was very hard.

I'm looking forward to playing the sequel. If I play it again,
I will use save states much less to force myself to gain more
skill at the game.
