    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the "living" board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it's not too hard to get used
to.</p>

<p>I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there's not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don't really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &amp;
weren't learning experiences.</p>

<p>I enjoy the game a lot, although I'm not sure how much I
like <em>this</em> game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn't find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn't effectively do the "hit yourself" trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn't do that because I
didn't have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don't feel like you're getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I'm
curious about the story, but I'll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son wanted to play this real bad rather than Mega Man X
(which we've been playing for a while.) So we did it. We played
through the whole game. I got stuck pretty bad on the Wily
Machine, but other than that I walked through the game pretty
easily. I happened to choose a really nice order for the levels
so I had a lot of good items and weapons during the levels. It
was really fun to go through the whole game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son wanted to see this played again today. We decided that my
wife would play (her first time) and she'd go against Metal
Man. It took her about 6 continues, but she eventually beat the
level. She used an E tank on the boss and got him on her first
try. Go team!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Played through 6 Robot Masters today with my 3-year old son while
my wife slept. I love the lesson he is learning: "If you die, Dad,
just continue and try again... don't worry it's not too hard, you
can do it."</p>
