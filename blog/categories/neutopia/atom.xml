    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Later in the day, I played for almost three hours.</p>

<p>I beat up to level 5. I find the game to be so much like LoZ but
bigger in ways that don't make it better.</p>

<p>There are some similar items (like the Rainbow Drop is the same as
the Ladder) and some unique ones (like the Glowing Moss). But
there's a lot that isn't there and what is added isn't great.</p>

<p>The levels are all a lot bigger, but they look too much the same
that they are extremely confusing and kind of frustrating. Same
with the various overworlds.</p>

<p>There are upgrades to your armor and weapon, but they don't really
feel much better because the enemies are getting stronger too. (In
contrast, in LoZ, the enemies in the overworld are all the same
and as you get stronger stuff, you see the same guys more and get
to thrash them.)</p>

<p>The bosses are huge and cool looking, but they take way too long
to kill once you've learned their pattern and can totally avoid
being hit.</p>

<p>Overall, the game just isn't as refined as LoZ. I got over the
problems with the combat with a little more attention, but I feel
like the rest of the game will just be a chore. I don't think I
will finish it.</p>

<p>I bet if I grew up with a TurboGrafx rather than a Nintendo, I
would love this game, but as it stands, it's just meh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about a half an hour today on an emulator.</p>

<p>It's a strange game. It seems like it is trying to be Legend of
Zelda I, but it has tried to evolve, it seems. For instance, I
felt like inside every cave was a person just blathering on about
stuff that didn't matter. The combat feels a bit... off. It's
like it is very hard to line enemies up. In LTTP, since the sword
slices in an arc, it never really matters if you aren't lined up
perfectly. In LoZ, you do need to be straight, but I think the
enemies are guaranteed to be in a grid, so it is easy to hit
them. It's a strange thing to miss. It seems like the dungeons
are much more linear and I got to the end of one, but couldn't
beat the boss (after a ton of tries)... it seems to have way too
much health.</p>

<p>I will give it another session... but I'm not impressed.</p>
