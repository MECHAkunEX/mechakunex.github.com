    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I listened to the <a href="http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380">Crunk Games</a> Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.</p>

and was blown away by how amazing Dragon Quest is when compared to
previous games. It really is a huge leap ahead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.</p>

<p>However, other than number 9, I've never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.</p>
