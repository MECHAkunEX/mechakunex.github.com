    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn't make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn't get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I'm doing terribly, but
it doesn't communicate to me in any way what I'm doing wrong. In
addition, I'm now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games... even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can't. Argh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for another 20 minutes. I got the boss down to
about 750... much better than I've done before. Before the X-RGB
I hadn't got past 1500; after the X-RGB I got to 1200, and today
I did even better. I feel like the end is in sight.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 20 minutes tonight. I used the X-RGB with the
Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can't wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn't get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don't think I'll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>
