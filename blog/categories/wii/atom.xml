    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played a few levels tonight and finished Area 6. I found a lot
of the levels to be really difficult to have two people, because
they use forced scrolling and the timed barrel jumps, which
require a lot more synchronization than is reasonable between two
people. Overall, the game seems to have multiplayer as an after
thought, especially with the varied capabilities of the two
players. The boss of Area 6 was very exciting to beat with my
wife, we were yelling and jumping out of our seats as we
recognized tells of the boss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn't move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don't think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a brutalizing experience with Commander Deko tonight. I
fought him for like 3 hours. The closest I ever got was about
880/3500 health. It's sooooo hard.</p>
