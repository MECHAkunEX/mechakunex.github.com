    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a lot today as I rested from being sick. There some
pretty memorable moments: I loved the joke about why one family
had been in charge of guarding the forbidden gate for so long. I
was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to say "No" to the
Count or console Callista... the romantic comedy structure is
really being forced on me. I find the establishment of Mirania as
this character with a weird "food" quirk to be pretty
hilarious. I'm still really enjoying this game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two and half hours and got back to the town. I
find it very charming how much this story is like Aladdin or a
romantic comedy. It was also neat how there was a monster
summoning spot right before a boss fight, almost like if you were
having trouble you could grind there, because the game is
normally very closed and linear. It's a neat structure.</p>

<p>TODO Go back to the mysterious island and go behind the entrance
where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again for about four hours. I got to the island and did
the two side quests there and then went to the Gurak base. I'm
really enjoying the flow of the story and the development of
Zael's &amp; Callista's relationship. I changed the combat controls
to Manual and I find it quite a bit more fun, even though I liked
it before. It is understandable, but I don't like that I can't go
to the arena right now... I am really strapped for cash and I
have a lot of upgrades I'd like to do. I think the narrator is a
really fun, cute little touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started this game today. I pre-ordered it and have been excited
about it since I heard that it would come out. I don't think I've
ever really been an extremely "Sakaguchi" Final Fantasy fan... I
feel like I've responded more to Kitase's direction, but
nevertheless, I enjoyed Blue Dragon and LOOOVED Lost Odyssey, so
I had high expectations for this game. But, after being let down
so bad so recently by Xenoblade, I was a little skeptical.</p>

<p>When I first turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that the
language is surprisingly crass. I think the very first sentence
has a swear. It's not the worst curses, but it's there and it was
a little jarring.</p>

<p>After that, I really enjoyed how the game started "in media
res". You have a really immediate connection to the action and the
characters and they reveal themselves in a pretty nice and subdued
way. I think the voice acting is really good... especially
Syrene's voice actress. She sounds very, very cool. In general,
all the characters strike me as really interesting and cool. The
"sweet" girl seems very sweet too, which I like.</p>

<p>At this point in the story (after chapter 6), I really like how
"low-key" the story is. Coming from Xenoblade where you fight
God, it's nice to have a story that is much more low level and
intimate (at least at the beginning, who knows what will happen
in the end?)</p>

<p>When I first got to the tavern, I was kind of amazed by the unique
voice acting and animated interactions with the group. I was
worried that I had accidentally advanced the story when I was
trying to just wander around and talk to people.</p>

<p>I feel like the sub-quest system isn't very good, because there's
no list of who wants what from you. This is a place where
Xenoblade was clearly superior in the interface department, but
Last Story seems to be keeping you more connected with the
characters, at the expense of forgetting about them all together.</p>

<p>The equipment system is interesting. It seems like armor isn't
really that important because they were all equal for me, but
they seem to have different status effects after they've been
upgraded. There seems to be an assumption that you will be
upgrading every item, rather than reserving upgrading for the end
(as many games, in fact, assume.)</p>

<p>I bought all the weapons and armor that I could in the first town
and maxed them all out (up to getting some sort of rare item that
would be required to progress them.)</p>

<p>The concept of "local goods" seems strange. I get the inkling
that you can do arbitrage to make money... sounds tedious. I hope
it isn't necessary.</p>

<p>The clothing dying system is difficult for me to imagine how to
use effectively. I feel like I want to look online for a gallery
of cool colourings. The "invisible" option is very intriguing.</p>

<p>When I was exploring, I found the arena. Syrene's dialogue about
it was awesome... so funny. I had a really hard time the first
time in the arena, because I had yet grasped the combat system. I
originally felt like I needed to be up next to enemies all the
time, but now I feel like it is more important to manage the
battlefield and setup sneak attacks, etc. I think I may also want
to turn on the "Manual" attack mode, because I think it will feel
better.</p>

<p>After I died and retried in the arena, I then played through the
first Season of the arena six more times. The combat system
is <em>really</em> <em>really</em> fun. I like it a lot and it was cool to just
go at it and feel the excitement of the mechanics. What an
awesome change from Xenoblade.</p>

<p>I moved on with the story after that and met Lisa... accidentally
tried to walk in on them in the bath and got some really funny
text. Then moved on to the next area. The boss in that area was
difficult to do properly, because I didn't realize I could do a
Slash over the railing. I was trying to get the auto-attack to
happen and it never did before I got hosed. Once I realized that
I could Slash, it was cake and I learned more about the game.</p>

<p>From this experience, I can say that I really love this game play
so far and I've very excited to see where the story goes too.</p>
