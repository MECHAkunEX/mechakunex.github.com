<h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/13/Game--Xenoblade-Chronicles--Wii--2012--3/">Game: Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii, 2012) (4)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-09-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I played for about two hours tonight. I did a lot of exploring and
got into the mines. I've decided that the game play in this really
sucks:

Basically the only task that you do in combat as a player is
click on the 8 buttons for the different skills. There's no real
reason to do any skill at any particular time, because status
effects will either stack or not and by the time one runs out,
you can just cast it again. So basically, everyone combat starts
by clicking everything and then waiting until you can click them
all again in sequence. Occasionally you have to remember to use
Enchant when you're fighting Mechon and to move around a little
after killing each enemy so you're in range, but you really don't
need to give any of it much more thought than that. I can tell
that no more strategy is required because I can basically walk
through the game up to this point, doing this strategy, and
winning basically every fight. I've only lost if I got into a
fight that was way over level or I was too close to two groups of
enemies and they joined together. It's very uninteresting.

Outside of combat, there also isn't that much to do because each
character basically only has 10 or so abilities and they are all
so meh and I can't imagine really caring one way or another about
why you'd pick one versus the other.

I can't really understand why a lot of people gave this game such
high reviews. It pales in comparison to other RPGs like FF13 or
Lost Odyssey, where there are actually interesting choices to
make in combat. I've read so much that the game is so good
because it takes (presumably "good") Western ideas and mixes them
with Japanese design. Man, this Western design, if it means the
combat system, is total junk. I've read that it's very similar to
WoW... now I'm sure I wouldn't like WoW.

I've tried to think of why I feel like it's different than FF12,
which was very MMO-ish. I think the reason why it is different is
the Gambits. Basically in FF12, Gambits automated what the player
is "doing" in Xenoblade. Since that was necessarily going on, the
game was free to through bigger challenges on top of those and
have lots of split second usage of the special moves, which
constituted a really large set. In Xenoblade, you never feel like
you died because of lack of strategy, you feel like you died
because of stupid AI or not enough grinding. Whereas in FF12, I
could die, gain some knowledge from the experience, restart and
immediately win the battle, because I knew something I didn't
know before. With Xenoblade (so far), the only reason you didn't
grind enough or you fell asleep with an active fight.

Xenoblade has caused me to think about RPG combat systems at the
meta-level a bit. In Xeno, you have 8 skills, each with separate
cool-downs, so basically every 30 seconds you are using skill A
and since you can spawn so many at once, basically, there are
little bursts of doing a lot of skills followed by waiting around
for the skills to be reusable. In contrast, in a traditional
JRPG, there are about 30 or 40 skills (i.e. magic spells,
summons, attack techniques, etc) plus items. Each skill has a
cost of some kind so you can't always choose it (summons are once
per battle, items are limited, spells use MP, etc.) But you can
only do one action every 5 seconds when your turn comes up. Since
every character is on their own timer and the enemies are acting
to. There is always one thing happening and you can always pay
attention to it (if it is a player, you're picking it, and if it
is an enemy, you're thinking about how to respond.) In contrast,
with Xeno, there's a lot going at once so you can't pay attention
and the decisions that you make are basically non-existent. Once
you choose the initial skill order, there's no reason to do
anything except use the skills again once they cool down. All
strategy takes place in the first few seconds and then you're
just doing a rote execution. In addition, the number of skills in
the traditional JRPG makes it so the solution space is much large
so it can more difficult to plan. (For example, you have the
elemental affinities, healing spells, buffs, etc.)

Xenoblade is just a really boring game combat-wise and the
meta-game is very tedious and/or confusing. I'm really let down
by this because the game was so hyped.

However, I'm incredibly compelled by the world and the story. It's
so strange and interesting. I want to play the game just to
experience that, provided it won't cost 50 hours. I wonder if I
can easily speed my way through the game without any grinding or
BS and if I'll be able to bear it long enough.

This conclusion makes most nervous about Last Story which I have
been equally (actually /more/ hyped about.) We'll see.

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/12/Game--Xenoblade-Chronicles--Wii--2012--2/">Game: Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii, 2012) (3)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-09-12T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>12</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">[This action button review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p%3D2597) of the game captures my feelings about a
lot of the system-overload this game throws at you so early and
the sheer weight of the quests. The comment about the difference
between abilities and skills is very apt---I have no clue what's
going on in that system. Something related is that for a lot of
the game so far I've been killing every enemy in my path, but then
I noticed that a lot of the enemies are just giving me 1 or 2
EXP... what's the point of that? But there doesn't seem to be a
good way to tell what is going to be a good amount of EXP before
hand. It's a bit confusing.

Today, I played for a little over three hours. I advanced the
story quite a bit. I was really annoyed by the lack of a feeling
of progress behind all the numbers. I repeatedly tried to get
past a little path that was blocked by enemies and I seemed to be
dying with no explanation.

I went back to the gem guy to create a whole bunch of gems, but I
don't really know if they are really all that good or if I
shouldn't have spent them all, because I have a lot of gems now
and not enough places to put them.

I'm really conflicted about the battle system. In some ways, it's
no different than a traditional FF or DQ game, because you
generally attack and then use special attacks when you have
enough energy to. But on the other hand, it feels like a lot of
meaningful decision is taken from you. For example, there's an
air of strategy in your positioning, but with huge crowds of
enemies it is so hard to see where you are, where their face is,
etc that being in the front/back/side is almost irrelevant
because you can't reliably tell. The whole
Monado-tells-the-future system being integrated into the combat
is really remarkable and unique. I'm not yet to the point though
where the vision really does me any good because I don't
understand how it is supposed to be canceled.

Basically, at this point, I find the whole game to be really
confusing in the mechanic department. There's a lot that I can do
and I'm treating it like a traditional JRPG, but I feel like I'm
missing something when I do, but I'm not really being punished
for ignoring it, but I'm constantly being flirted with by all
these other weird numbers and concepts. It's just a really
strange game.

<div class="entry-content">I played for about three hours tonight. I have a few thoughts
about my experiences tonight...

- The controls are really annoying. It is very weird that A is
the confirm button on the Wii Pro controller, because it is in
the cancel spot. There should have been a way to change.

- The user interface is really painful. There's a big loading
time to do everything. The equipment management system is
really annoying---you can't equip from a shop and when you
change equipment, the gems don't automatically get unequipped
and I haven't found a way to remove them other than putting the
thing back on and removing it from there. It's really
painful. The quick travel system is really slow too because you
have to go so deep in the menus.

- I'm amazed that the killed off what seemed like a main
character after giving you the opportunity to spend /a lot/ of
money on her to give a special bikini outfit. I didn't realize
it would be a wasted expense.

- The graphics are quite good for some Wii games, but feel really
bad in other ways. I think this is most noticeable when they
show faces, because they are totally flat. The environments are
really beautifully constructed and I love how open they are.

- The combat system is pretty interesting. I still don't feel
like I totally understand all my choices, but I have a bit of a
technique worked out that is being useful so far.

- The story is pretty compelling and the world is very bizarre
and fascinating for it.

<div class="entry-content">I started this game tonight. The opening sequence is really cool,
especially after the battle when it pulls out and shows you how
people live on the two giant titans. It's such a cool concept.

The battle system I experienced during the walk to the first
village was incredibly reminiscent of FF12, but with a bit more
action on the part of the player. When I got to the town, it was
incredibly tempting to go and find all the glowing blue things
and get all the quests, etc. I can tell that it will be hard to
not make this game a giant collect-a-thon for myself.

I'm finding the mechanics a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of
different options about how to equip characters, so many quests,
so many different ways to buy things. It's very intimidating. I
think I will do the obvious thing until it hurts me rather than
trying to compute what the best solution will be.

I was amazed at how many different quests I unlocked so early,
though.

The voice acting in this game is actually really good. I almost
never like non-Japanese voice acting, because it is normally just
so horrendous. (Actually, now that I think about, Asura's Wrath
was pretty good.) Since the actors in this game are British,
there's something really fun and exotic about them. I like it.

I'm pretty excited to be playing this game. (One annoyance: I'm
using the Wii Pro controller. I hate having to have it plugged in
to the Wiimote that sits stupidly next to me on the couch.)

<div class="entry-content">I played this afternoon for like an hour. I got up to Bald
Bull. During the fight with Soda Popinski that I won, I was in the
second round and had him down twice and he got me down for the
second time... I considered restarting, but didn't and won. Woot!

Later in the day I played for a bit more and got to
Mr. Sandman. He's really really hard. I've decided to put this as
"Scheduled" game and play it weekly until I beat him, rather than
burning a lot of time all at once.

I'm kind of appalled that I was able to get to the end so
quickly, but I know it will take a while to beat Sandman and
online I read that there is another round of fighting every enemy
during Title Defense. So it will be a fun experience, but not
really something you can binge on too much.

<div class="entry-content">Today we played for an hour and a half-ish. We beat the game! The
final boss and the last rocket sequence was pretty tough and my
wife was getting very frustrated, but we eventually did it.

The Nintendo Channel clocks our total time at 20 hours and 52
minutes (I haven't been keeping track of our game play that long.)

We decided that the game is a lot more sloppy in many ways
compared to NSMBW, but that we had a lot of fun, especially once
we got infinite lives. We don't love the game enough to try to get
all the bonuses to unlock the hidden temple, so that's that.

I like platformers, but I like playing games with my wife more.

tough time with Bear Hugger before I realized that I could duck
the Bear Hug. I only fought one round against Great Tiger, so I'm
just learning his patterns. It is interesting how this game is
almost, but not quite, identical to the NES version. There are
some things that are better and more convenient (like Saves and
Retry in the middle of a match) but other than that it's just
tweaked on the edges. It's cool.

<div class="entry-content">We played for an hour and beat the first three levels of
World 8. There was a normal platforming level (although it had
lots of breaking platforms), then a rocket level, then a mine-cart
level. The rocket levels are so terrible because they are just
memorization mazes with an awful control scheme. It was
annoying. But eventually I got in the zone and did it. I think my
wife was a bit mad because she kept trying and dying every other
time.

<div class="entry-content">We played for about two hours and beat the rest of the factory
levels. We discovered a way to grind for balloons but decided not
to. We traded our time for just using a cheat code that gives
infinite balloons. It's amazing how much more fun the game is
now, because we can play a little less cautiously and give my
wife more opportunities to do the difficult platforming sequences
where she used to just climb on my back. I think that might be
why we liked Mario so much more, because the Desert Life grind is
so effective.

of the levels to be really difficult to have two people, because
they use forced scrolling and the timed barrel jumps, which
require a lot more synchronization than is reasonable between two

the secret of marital bliss is she tells me what to do, and I do

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/22/Game--Muramasa--The-Demon-Blade--Wii--2009--0/">Game: Muramasa: The Demon Blade (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-22T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii.

I can't believe how good this game is. It is stunningly
beautiful. The gameplay is really fun and never gets old. The
story is unique. Wow, just wow.

A few things I really loved:
- The backgrounds are DEEP and many layered. I loved walking
through a forest and seeing the shaded groves in the back. I
loved walking through the countryside and seeing houses in the
background. The detail is just exceptional.
- I love the interaction with the environment during battle. For
example, you'll be fighting in a bamboo forest, and when you
attack you will cut bamboo shoots and they'll fall down. It is a
really subtle effect, but it feels and looks great when it
happens.
- I love the art on the food that the characters eat and the
animation of bites being taken out of it. Again, it is a very
subtle and funny thing to see, but I liked it so much I went out
of my way to eat everything so I could see what it looked
like. It made me hungry for Japanese food.
- I enjoy that the characters can hang out a hot spring to get
rejuvenated. It is especially funny when they run into a spirit,
a monkey, or the other character while they're there, because
there's always funny dialogue.
- I like that both stories revolve around a woman: Momohime is the
central character of her story, although the possessing spirit
is also important; Kisuke is not really the central character in
his, instead Torahime is.
- I /really/ like how the characters talk trash against enemies in
the dialogue sequences before they fight them. It is really
funny and the style of their trash talk is really unique too.

A few things I thought could be better:
- It was a pain to see how many souls you'd collected, because it
was on the Start menu or the main screen. It was a few clicks
away.
- The animation getting out of battle was a little slow and didn't
kick in until all the souls had floated to you. So there were
quite a few times when I was traveling a far distance and was
annoyed that I had to wait so long to move again.
- It was annoying to keep track of which Enemy Lairs you'd
defeated, because there was not "Todo list" and they looked the
same on the map before and after you'd completed them (although
not before and after you'd unlocked them, but you don't find out
the level recommendation until you'd unlocked them.)

One way you can tell how much I liked the game was my desire to
complete /everything/. The game has two characters and
three endings per character. Here are my stats for my
playthroughs:
- Momohime: 1st ending: 7 hours, 32 minutes; Level 47
- Kisuke: 1st ending: 5 hours, 40 minutes; Level 41
- Momohime: 2nd ending: 11 hours, 51 minutes; Level 92
- Kisuke: 2nd ending: 6 hours, 27 minutes; Level 49
- Momohime: 3rd ending: 13 hours, 20 minutes; Level 99
- Kisuke: 3rd ending: 9 hours, 5 minutes; Level 86

I really liked the game and highly recommend it.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/03/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2010--1/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2010) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">Since I bought Sin & Punishment 2, I haven't played it
commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.

Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I've completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&Kachi. I've 1CC'd every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.

Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&Kachi. So rad.

Since I've been playing again, I've thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I've thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.

It is a really remarkable game.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/13/Game--A-Boy-and-His-Blob--Wii--2009--0/">Game: A Boy and His Blob (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I recently played through A Boy and His Blob for the Wii. I'd been
watching this game since it was announced because it was 2D,
looked beautiful, and looked really cute too.

When I first started playing, I was very thorough: getting
every treasure and going through every challenge level, but
eventually (as you read below) the challenge levels became
incredibly painful and I started to hate the game because of
them. After that I just raced through the game and didn't even get
many chests in the final world.

# Things I loved

The 2D graphics are really pretty. I like the brightness and
the fluidity of them in particular. I like that the levels reflect
what the world map implies about them and sometimes you can see
the later landmarks on the map from inside them.  For example,
seeing the tower from the middle of the final world was epic.

The whole style is incredibly cute and heartwarming. The boy is
the best five year old I've ever seen in a game and I love the hug
animation. Even the enemies are kind of pudgy and cute.

The vast variety of beans is very entertaining. Only a few of
them overlap in functionality, so the puzzles are not necessarily
"non-linear", but the variety of different kinds of puzzles keeps
it fresh. I would've liked a mode where I could play a level with
a custom selection of beans (perhaps after I beat it or got all
the chests.)

The puzzles are clever enough. There are a few places where you
can really break things with creativity, but that is fun. For
example, you can get birds to hit mine blobs and just walk out of
some otherwise difficult things; the Zorb bean can survive any
fall and is invulnerable, so you can just jump in it and then jump
off a cliff rather than blob-achute down. I think the final areas
(in the castles) had the best puzzles in terms of difficulty and
interestingatude.

I was very surprised when I got to the first boss battle. I
thought the worked really well as multi-part puzzles. Although,
I'll complain about them more later... that they exist is
definitely a plus.

I was impressed with the lack of text and the way the game
communicated to you what you were supposed to do and the
intentions of the blob, etc. This is best illustrated by the lack
of a menu. I love that you turn the game on and are almost
instantly controlling the boy.

MECHA BLOB!

# Things I hated

Although the puzzles were clever and interesting, there was not
enough mystery because almost every stage has a sign instructing
you which of the four beans is the correct one to use for that
segment. This really kills a lot of the enjoyment, because you're
not so much "solving the puzzle" as "executing the solution". I
will complain below about the tools you have for "executing", so
this turns out to be a big problem.

Unlike the rest of the game, the challenge levels don't have
checkpoints. This makes playing them really jarring because it
doesn't fit with the general feel. Since the challenge levels have
the hardest "reflex" challenges (more below), this is particularly
annoying. Some of the challenge levels are just stupid-cheap
too. For example, I quit playing them after one where you had to
drop a Trampobean down a pit and then jump hoping you landed on it
correctly. You then had to do this four more times, restarting
from the beginning when you missed. Since the beans bounce and
have physics applied to them, it is frustrating and unsatisfying
to make the jump correctly.

There are a few annoying bugs. Level 4-1 sticks in my mind
because you don't have the blob with you, so he doesn't eat the
chests. Instead, you drop them into the ground level where the
blob will get them later. I dropped every chest and made it to the
next checkpoint, yet only two chests were there at the
end. Arggh.

# The biggest most "shoot myself in the face" problem

The controls are unimaginably bad. They are sluggish and
inaccurate. It is like trying to push an anvil with a wet
noodle. I've read the developers talk about how this is partly
because the boy is supposed to be a clumsy kid but that seems like
a total cop-out. This just plain sucks. I think the sluggish-ness
would not be as bad if you could use the D-pad to control the boy,
but even on the Classic controller (where most buttons duplicate
what another button does), you cannot. This is especially dumb
because the game is 2D.

In general, this horrible control would be much more passable
if the game did not require reflexes. Yet, there are many reflex
sections that require exact platforming control yet the mechanics
do not give the ability to do it. I don't mind restarting levels,
etc (I play shmups after all), but that's because the games I play
that require that always make clear that it is /your fault/
when you die and it never feels like the game's fault. I can
honestly say that almost all the time, I felt like I was dying
because the controls were so bad. There is nothing more
frustrating than this.

The bad controls are made worse by some of the custom bean
controls. The Zorb, Rocket, and Bouncer are the biggest offenders,
because they are the most mobile beans. The Blobachute is bad
too.

This problem is why the challenge levels were so bad. They were
almost all reflex based and had a higher than normal restart
penalty. The bosses were frustrating for the same reason. The
third boss was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I
wanted to blow my brains out. Ugh.

# The verdict

This is a good game, but not a classic. I only want to play
classics. I don't think I'll be playing this much more, but if I
have a young friend in the near future I may point them at this or
donate the game to them.

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/31/Game--New-Super-Mario-Brothers-Wii--Wii--2009--1/">Game: New Super Mario Brothers Wii (Wii, 2009) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.

We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn't stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we've completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.

I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.

The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I'm a major
opponent of innovation for innovation's sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.

This game is FUN. I can't wait to play with the *REDACTED* and his
sister (We haven't decided on her pseudonym yet.)

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/29/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2010--0/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I got Sin & Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.

/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.

The best reviews of this game are...
<blockquote><p>Here's the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>"YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure's latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>

And...

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>...</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>

The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.

The only problem with the game, for me, is that I'm a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can "Save & Quit" without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won't score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.

my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I'd like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I've seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don't need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I've played with enjoy it and wouldn't like it if they had to do
more.
