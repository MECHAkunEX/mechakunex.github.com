<div class="entry-content">I played today for almost three hours and beat the game. I beat
levels 6, 7, and 8 as Maria. Then, I beat 8 as Richter. Then I
beat 4' as Richter to get to 5'. I did 5' as Maria (and continued
on to beat the game on the same continue.)

When I finally beat Dracula as Richter, I wasn't hit at all in his
human form, but was hit just once in his giant man-bat form (by
the blue energy wave, that I think you are supposed to duck
under.)

This is a very satisfying game to beat. I will definitely
continue playing it in the future... especially since I invested
in a PC Engine to be able to play it. It's a blast.

Although... I'm annoyed that I only have 96% completion on the
save screen... despite having done everything in the game. I'm not
sure what I'm supposed to do to bring it to 100%.

<div class="entry-content">In the morning, we played for about a half hour and beat level 4'
via the secret route---beating Camilla---but not getting to 5'. I
started on stage 5 a bit, but was pretty beat down.

Later, I played for about an hour and a half and beat
stage 5. Eventually I was able to use the watch to get through up
to Death without getting hit at all... by pausing the action just
before the large green monsters. Sometimes this game seems totally
impossible and brutalizing. The key seems to always be using the
sub-weapons effectively and breaking the challenges. Or, learning
pitch perfect timing and getting through unscathed... but mostly
doing the sub-weapons just right. It's a fascinating design.

After I mastered that, it took about 7 tries to kill Death. I
stuck with the Cross. I used an Item Crash early and pummeled
him. I dodged the huge skulls by staying to the left and
right. The melee fight was pure stick-and-move. It is so
satisfying to win at this game.

After Death was dead, I fought the Vampire Bat and was killed
Medusa in the Boss rush stage. I decided to go back and fight
Camilla again, because supposedly you need to beat Death to get
the secret exit... but no luck.

<div class="entry-content">This morning I played this game with my son for about an hour. We
beat level 2 the normal way after getting Maria. Now I have
unlocked up to 4 and 4'. We tried 4 but were totally brutalized by
the boss playing as Maria (she's really weak.) We also rescued two
of the non-playable girls. Still... amazing game.

Later in the day we played for about thirty minutes and beat level
4' via the normal route and got to stage 5. I wish the game a
better way of tracking which levels/exits you have done.

<div class="entry-content">I bought a PC Engine and got this game. It is really fun to play
it again, especially without an emulator and save states, so I
have to do it better. Additionally, I've had a lot more
experience with the other early Castlevania games so I'm just
better at playing it. It's really fun and smooth feeling, despite
having classic Casltevania stickiness.

I played only as Richter today and I did all secret exits. I went
from 0 to 1 to 2' to 3' to 4'. I fought the Serpent, the Minotaur,
the Werewolf, and the floaty head thing. It's a lot of fun.

<div class="entry-content">I decided that I'm not going to continue playing this game. It's
definitely not a bad game, but it's also not an excellent
game. Given its age, there are really some interface things that
it should have done better:

- attacks should not go into empty space
- you should be able to see what equipment will improve your stats
and buy them easier
- you should be able to see what items do

Now, if I had a lot of nostalgia for this game, I would be much
more willing to play it to experience the story and world again,
but I have much more nostalgia for the second game. In terms of
story, this game basically does everything I think is cool in the
first few hours and then it's just been standard JRPG fare.

I do find the concept of the Old Cave with the "task" system to be
pretty interesting, but not enough to make me want to keep doing
it.

Basically this game will be left aside because of the "there's
not enough time in the world to play non-amazing games". I guess
this means that I can't really recommend the game either, because
there's things you should play instead, but it's still not a
"bad" game. For example, I prefer it to the PS3 Star Ocean or
some of the other modern junk I've tried to play.

to the Tower in the Northwest, but the enemies in the entry way
were pretty brutal. I feel like this game is almost all grind in
that way the DQ can be. There haven't really been any cute
moments in the story since the main character and Lufia don't
talk to each other anymore.

<div class="entry-content">We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool "abilitease". I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I've
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn't realize it. But
now, it's quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It's cute so far though.

took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.

<div class="entry-content">My son and I played this today; specifically SMB1. In the past he
has been able to get to the first pit, but rarely, because he is
still getting used to platforming. Today he did great and got to
it 5 times in row, but couldn't get past. It is interesting to
watch him play, because it makes you think about the game
differently. Avoiding a Goomba just requires jumping, because they
come to you. Getting over the pipes just requires jumping and
holding Right against it. But, a pit requires a little bit of a
run and jump at the right time.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I'm a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I'd never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It's really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn't have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.

[This review](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335) of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn't do better. Check that out.

When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, "This looks
cool." That's a good sign.

<div class="entry-content">I played Kid Dracula for the Gameboy. It's a very straight-forward
platformer with a shooting mechanic. It has a little bonus
mechanic of different kinds of magic that let Kid Dracula turn
into a bat, walk on the ceiling, use a protective umbrella,
etc. Most of these things are only useful in a few places in the
eight level game, but they are present enough to make it fun to
use them. The best part about the game, however, is the clever cut
parody of the Castlevania series. Most of the common enemies show
up in super-cute form.

<div class="entry-content">I just finished playing Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo on the PC
Engine CD.

This game is /amazing/. The levels are all so unique and
interesting. They are all challenging and the boss are
particularly frustrating, but totally satisfying and fun. I loved
being able to play as Maria after I rescued her. I can't wait to
play Symphony of the Night again and pay attention to the
interactions with Maria. The game is definitely easier with her. I
only played with her through the alternate route and I beat
Dracula with both Richter and Maria. Naturally I also got 100%,
but I'd like to play it again sometime and go with Maria through
the primary route and Richter through the alternate route.</p>

Update: One more thing. If you've played a Castlevania game,
you know how when you beat a boss, this magic sphere appears that
refills your health or advances you to the next level. I
/always/ jump to get it. It is so much fun!

I /absolutely/ recommend this game!

Finished with these paths:
Richter:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> Final
Prisoners: 2, 7

Maria:
1 -> 2' -> 3' -> 4' -> 5' -> 6 + Final
Prisoners: 3', 4'
