    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he'd be weak, but he wasn't), then we went to Sting
Chameleon's stage and got the Armor upgrade. I'm not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te----dious!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played for about twenty minutes. We did the
Intro stage and then Chill Penguin. We got the dash and got to
the boss, but died on the first time and were out of lives. He
wanted to play Launch Octopus again so we did that had a tough
time with the ships before it was time for breakfast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played again today. He didn't want to play as much, but I
showed him each of the games on it and he thought SMB2 was really
cool. He got over 1 pit in SMB1!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son and I played this today; specifically SMB1. In the past he
has been able to get to the first pit, but rarely, because he is
still getting used to platforming. Today he did great and got to
it 5 times in row, but couldn't get past. It is interesting to
watch him play, because it makes you think about the game
differently. Avoiding a Goomba just requires jumping, because they
come to you. Getting over the pipes just requires jumping and
holding Right against it. But, a pit requires a little bit of a
run and jump at the right time.</p>
