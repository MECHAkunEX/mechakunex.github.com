    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Played Episode 41 Level 4 for almost an hour. Sometimes when I
play this game, I think to myself, "Wow, I hate this game's
controls so much." It is so frustrating that they never seem to
work right. Super Meat Boy has almost ruined every other
platformer for me. In fact, I'm so mad at the game right now, I am
demoting it from every two days to once a week.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing Episode 39 for over an hour. The majority of
that time was spent on level 1. My eyes hurt and I can't play
anymore. I'm going to take a break. Currently I am at
level 4. Phew!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the levels in the game are just too absurd. For example,
Episode 39, level 1 has you do the same challenge over and over
again. The game just isn't very streamlined in the teaching
you. You feel like you know how to do something but are forced to
do it again, even though you aren't really dying and
restarting. Obviously I'll still be it, but it's very
annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a
time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Episode 37, Level 4 was a very difficult level to start, but I was
able to do it relatively fast because I realized it was easy to
"wall jump" on the sideways elevator rather than stand on top of
it where you slide around a lot on it.</p>
