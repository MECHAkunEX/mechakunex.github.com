    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got past Vile, but had a heck of a time getting up the wall with
the flying platformers... it was so painful. I feel like I'm
really letting my kids down when they watch me and expect
awesomeness.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent a lot of time trying to get the Hadouken today. I
eventually got it, but I find it almost impossible to use because
you need to be at full health. I got to the Spider in Sigma's
fortress, but couldn't get past it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again quite a lot today. I think all that is left is
Armored Armadillo and two heart tanks (before moving on to
Sigma's fortress.) This game is soooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he'd be weak, but he wasn't), then we went to Sting
Chameleon's stage and got the Armor upgrade. I'm not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te----dious!</p>
