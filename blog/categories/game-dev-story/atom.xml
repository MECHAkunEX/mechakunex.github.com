    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Game Dev Story for iOS was on sale and I bought it. (The first
game I've ever bought for the iPhone for myself. (I bought my wife a
puzzle game.))</p>

<p>In this game, you simulate managing a video game company. You
hire staff (first 4, then 6, then 8) and pick what games you'll
make. You control the genre and theme of the game. There are a
wide variety of very funny combinations. (One of my most
successful games was a "Poncho" themed Action RPG.) You then
choose which of your staff will be in charge of the game, its
graphics, and sound. You can improve staff by leveling them up
with points or by training them. Training could be giving them
vacations, or sending them to college, or sending them to read
manga. (Trainings unlock more genres. For example, when you send a
coder on a long trip, they learn about the Poncho genre.) You can
advertise through a variety of means (I like Lunar Writing.) It's
really funny.</p>

<p>When I first started playing this game, it was super crack. It
is very satisfying to see the numbers go up and to hear the fire
noises and all that fun stuff. I like to see my profits and sales
go up, etc. However, the game gets pretty boring once you get all
the best staff and get into a rhythm. For me, that happen around
year 11 (there are 20 years in the game, each takes about 30
minutes I'd guess) when I hired all the "hackers" and started my
sequence of making a new game with high popularity and a good
combination, then a sequel, then back and forth. After that time,
every game was rated about 35 (out of 40) and I made millions. I
ended the game after making 67 games, selling 552,575,044 units,
and with $892,280.9K in the bank. My highest selling game was Dr
Bomboo with total sales of 31,708,001 units. Dr Bomboo was the
third in a series of robot-themed shooters. The name of my company
was "Get Bonus".</p>

<p>Overall, the game wasn't deep enough for its length, but the
first half was too much fun.</p>
