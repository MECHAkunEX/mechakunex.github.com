    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for a bit. It's definitely better than the
last one. It seems a lot more deep and complex. It's got this
non-linear-ness to it which is interesting, but the controls are
still pretty sloppy. There were many times when I just couldn't
line up with an enemy and it was on top of me doing damage every
time it was possible. I'm still hopeful for the next sequel. But
this game doesn't do it for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for about an hour today. I used an emulator and
couldn't resist save states. In the beginning, I worked my way
through on my own, using saves at each screen. I had no sense of
what the items would do, so I didn't really buy any. After a
while, I looked at a walkthrough (which basically just recommended
which items to buy) and learned that I missed a few essential
hidden items. I restarted and made it to stage 4 following the
guide. I went away to eat, paused, and when I came back, the game
had reset itself.</p>

<p>This game looks and sounds really good, especially for its
age. It's cute and has some interesting mechanics. I think of it
as a lot like Zelda 2, but with a less interesting combat system,
sloppier mechanics, and a more advanced inventory system. I found
the jumps to feel really wrong and the combat delays to be pretty
painful. The inventory system, once you realize what things are,
is neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I'd say that this is a pretty amazing game for its age,
but that a lot about it works against it. The biggest problem is
the lack of continues. The game is too deep on a customization
level to make sense as an arcade game. I presume that later
version of the game change this, because they were designed for
consoles. Secondly, the sprites are a bit too big and they make
it hard to see what's going on. Third, the jumps and fighting
don't feel quite right.</p>

<p>I won't play this, but I'm excited to investigate other games in
this series.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.</p>

<p>This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn't get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn't get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
<a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=46&amp;gi=6946&amp;vi=7899">2,122,630</a>, but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)</p>

<p>I used lots of save states and I don't think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn't get to level 10.</p>
