<div class="entry-content">I listened to the [Crunk Games](http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380) Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/20/Game--Kid-Icarus--NES--1986--0/">Game: Kid Icarus (NES, 1986)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-20T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.

Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn't
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.

I will play it again, but I'll move on to the next game for
now. I've realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I'll play through it
right then, otherwise I'll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the "play in
the future" list.

<div class="entry-content">I tried to play Ikari Warriors on my Famicom. I wanted to play it
because I've heard it talked about some many times. But it was
excruciatingly slow. I couldn't tell if it was the fault of my
PowerPak or the normal behavior, but when I looked at videos
online, it didn't seem like it was normally faster. It reminded me
a little bit of Iron Tank, which I remember liking.

<div class="entry-content">A while ago I played Milon's Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game... which is
otherwise really opaque.

The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn't love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I'd have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don't totally love the mechanics and I can't save in between
play sessions, so I'd have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I'd seen enough.

<div class="entry-content">I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon's
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.

In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.

I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn't love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.

I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.

However, other than number 9, I've never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Metroid over the past few days. (I started on the
10th, got the majority of the items and killed Kraid. Then the
next day I got two missile tanks and got to Ridley's zone. Then
today I finished Ridley's zone and finished the game.)

This is another game that I remember very fondly as a kid. I
remember using my dad's maps and playing through it a lot, and
then discovering the JUSTIN BAILEY code and using it a lot too. I
don't remember ever beating it though, or even really doing very
good or getting very far.

I think the problem when I was young is that I didn't have the
patience to grind out health to refill all the tanks that I got;
whereas playing through the game this time, I spent a lot of time
doing that to be prepared for the enemies. If you are willing to
do that, the game gets a lot easier.

The final area with the Metroids and Mother Brain is brutal
though. Much much harder than any other part of the game. The
Metroids practically instantly kill you if they catch you. I had
to play through it quite a few times.

Overall, this game totally survived replaying and remains as
awesome in my mind as I've always thought.

Got every item but didn't kill Mother Brain.

<div class="entry-content">I played The Legend of Zelda on my AV Famicom with a RetroZone
PowerPak. It was awesome.

I started on Monday and played for about an hour while the *REDACTED*
was asleep. I got to the 2nd Dungeon, but got my butt kicked
pretty bad. I played yesterday and spent a lot of time in the
beginning crawling the map buying everything and finding all the
heart containers I could, then I got up to the 6th Dungeon in a
few hours. Today, I took it the rest of the way. I found the 6th
Dungeon to be very hard. I was able to complete the last dungeon
with two visits: the first one got me all the items and got me
familiar with the layout, but when I got to Ganon, I died, because
I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try---I only
used one potion too.

I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn't shoot arrows (they consume money.)

It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don't remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad's map.

I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult---much more so than modern Zelda games---but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn't
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.

I'm very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.

<div class="entry-content">Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.

This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn't get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn't get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
[2,122,630](http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=46&gi=6946&vi=7899), but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)

I used lots of save states and I don't think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn't get to level 10.
