    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult---basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein's Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It's similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you're basically toast.</p>

<p>The part I got to, where there's Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it's super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It's a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls &amp; bats. It was cute.</p>

<p>I think I will play it again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I listened to the <a href="http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380">Crunk Games</a> Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.</p>

and was blown away by how amazing Dragon Quest is when compared to
previous games. It really is a huge leap ahead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got this game when I ordered my AV Famicom from Japan. I
immediately tried it but it seems to be corrupted or something
because both the actual cart and the ROM (through my PowerPak)
have all sorts of graphical glitches. Reading the Wikipedia page
makes it sound intriguing, but I can't try it.</p>
