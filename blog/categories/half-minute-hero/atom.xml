    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.</p>

<p>It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn't interested in doing more.</p>

<p>I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don't really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I've thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.</p>
