    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn't crazy about it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I've played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can't deal
with it.</p>

<p>The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.</p>
