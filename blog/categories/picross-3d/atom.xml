    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For approximately the last year, I've been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a "Perfect" score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.</p>

<p>I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.</p>
