    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've never played this puzzle game before. There's nothing too
wrong with it as a concept, but I find it very difficult to enjoy
puzzle games like this for a long time. They would really be best
as rotating little games in a larger context. This particular
version of the Columns concept, however, feels really broken.</p>

<p>As you get jewels, it gets faster and faster. It gets so fast that
you can't think at all and the best you can do it plan one move
ahead and then rotate the blocks as they've just landed to make
the most of the situation. It actually feels like you're not
really making decisions and are winning randomly.</p>

<p>I was able to make it 22 levels and there were many times I
basically gave up but randomly got triples that totally changed
my luck. Weird.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played another five matches in the middle of the day over about
an hour. I discovered a new trick: after expending all your super
kicks (or just getting an advantage), run down the clock so you
win. I found two good ways to run down the clock: First, knock out
a member of the other team and go into the zone that only he
defends and wait. Second, continually to head-butt passes (the AI
never intercepts these). Hah!</p>

<p>At the end of the day I played again for another hour or so and
beat the game. The final few matches were really tough to keep the
ball on my side and I got scored on more than any other matches,
but I was able to win with a bit of abuse. It's a fun game to play
and I can imagine it being more difficult and interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got to the boss of stage 2 after playing for about 35
minutes. I've heard about this game many times before and I had
much greater expectations about how crazy and silly it would
be. I thought the bosses I fought were very cool, but overall, it
wasn't too crazy.</p>

<p>The mechanics are very reasonable for its time... it's just
Gradius. My only problem with it is that the NES is not a good
system for it: it has really atrocious and not intentional
slow-down; the sprite flicker is really bad and makes it hard to
see enemy bullets; and, the game lacks the vibrancy that it seems
like it should have. I'm also quite spoiler by CAVE when it comes
to being able to distinguish enemy bullets from mine and seeing
the hit box of the character easily.</p>

<p>I will try the other Parodius games rather than invest any more
time in this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These TECHNOS games feel so good. I like the dynamics in this
game and the way it feels great to tackle your opponent. I really
enjoy more abstract sports games like this. I don't know if I
wouldn't like the more modern, realistic sports games... I
presume I wouldn't, but I haven't really played them. One thing
about this game though, is that I don't think it could sustain
playing it for a long sitting. I played for a little more than
thirty minutes and that seems like the right amount of time. I
think I will keep at it and beat it... maybe?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played the first, second, and third levels over about an
hour. I didn't finish the last level.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the game. It is extremely similar to Advance Wars. I
find the interface in Advance Wars to be superior and the game is
more complex, but not in a way that is extremely complex. Both
are very simple, but they allow that simplicity to be used to
create interesting and challenging situations. But, because of
the similarity, I don't feel a great compulsion to play this
game, particularly when it is so inconvenient to do so. (I have a
Japanese PC Engine, so my Hu-Card doesn't work, so I have to
emulate it.)</p>

<p>Maybe if I got deeper into the game, there would be something
unlike about it that would be worth understanding, but after
scanning a FAQ, it doesn't seem so.</p>

<p>I would really like a procedurally generated game like this where
I could play at incredibly small chunks overtime. Until then... I
think I'll abandon it.</p>
