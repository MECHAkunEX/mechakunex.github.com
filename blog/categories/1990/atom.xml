    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have this cartridge and my son thinks the box art is cool. We
played today for a little and I beat the first level... which I
haven't done any of the last four or five times he's wanted to
see the game. I feel like it's a pretty brutal game, because most
animals (and Nemo) have no offense abilities.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I beat Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Magnet
Man. I think it took three continues. The kids instigated it and I
think this time we'll actually play through the whole
game... gradually.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I beat Hard Man and Snake Man. Snake Man, and
his level, were excruciatingly hard. I found it very hard to
avoid Snake Man or do enough damage, but I lucked out with a good
pattern when I finally got him. I found the smoke stacks to be
the worst part of his level. A few times when the platform
appeared it launched me off into the abyss. Other times, the
bullets would hit me in mid-air, even if I killed them first
(because they'd respawn when I realigned so I wouldn't be pushed
off. It was very painful.</p>

<p>Total time: 1:12</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kids and I played this for a bit today. We did Needle Man and
couldn't do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn't get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played through Snake Man's level, then started
Hard Man. He thought Snake Man was very cool. He said, at the
beginning of the level, "Is this Snake Man's body?" because it
looked like a Snake. He's very cute when he watches me play Mega
Man.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just played through Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake over the last
three or four days. I played the MSX2 version that comes with
Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.</p>

<p>This game is the true prequel to Metal Gear Solid. The story is
explicitly a sequel, whereas the original Metal Gear is obviously
ret-con'd to be about the same stuff. The themes definitely
originate here: the pacifism is so much more clear. The gameplay
gets a whole lot deeper in this game with the radar, the guards
hearing you, etc. There are very direct callbacks to this game in
later entries in the series---such as climatic fist fights.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game. I initially found it much harder than
the first one because the guards are so much more perceptive and
the first area is a tightly confined space, but as I played I got
a lot better. Also, it is harder to be glutted with ammo and
rations, but you definitely get to that point by the end of the
game. I was initially confused and annoyed about when you were
allowed to save, but then I realized it was on area transitions
(when there was a loading screen) and so I was able to use that to
my advantage when I was going to a place I was scared of.</p>

<p>Here are my play-through stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Easy
Play Time: 4:59:44
Save: 27
Continue: 17
Alert Mode: 117
Humans Killed: 246
Ration Used: 7
Special Item: Not Used
Code Name: Zebra</p>
