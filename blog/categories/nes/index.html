going through Stone Man's stage. I got to him and was doing pretty
well, but the Mega Buster wasn't powerful enough against him. The
spinning things are the worst... they crowd you and you can't
shoot them while they are touching you. It stinks, you have to
draw them away and then jump n shoot them.

past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.

beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me

the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:

<div class="entry-content">I listened to the [Crunk Games](http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380) Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Dragon Warrior 3 over the past week and a half.

My opinions on this game are very similar to DW1 and DW2. This
much more mechanically strong that DW2 but not as much of a leap
as DW2 was over DW1. I enjoyed the class changing system.

I used anti-grinding Game Genie codes to limit the amount I had to
do it---one gave me more XP and the other more GP. The combat
system gets pretty old, especially with random monsters. Fighting
the bosses is typically really fun.

I also played with a guide, so I didn't have to figure out where I
needed to go myself, but I got the impression that it was much
less obscure than DW2, but not as clear as even a SNES-era game.

For these two reasons, I definitely didn't get a true DW3
experience, although I'm willing to bet that I wouldn't want that
experience. Instead, I just enjoyed the story.

The connection to the other games is easily the coolest part of
this and really comes out of nowhere, but makes complete sense
after the fact. I thought it was also really cool how you run into
your father right at the end. It's really neat.

I'm looking forward to the first truly played DW game.

but not the "simple control but complex depth" that defines so
many great NES games. I don't think I play it again. I think if it
was a bit faster and maybe with more fluid/intuitive controls it
could be really awesome.

<div class="entry-content">The first Mega Man game I think I owned and played a lot was Mega
Man 2. But I remember trying to play Mega Man 1 quite a few times,
I don't know if I bought it or if I rented it from
Blockbuster. Regardless, I wasn't very good at it and can't really
ever remember getting to Wily's Castle at all. I think the biggest
problem was the lack of continues or passwords.

Today that 20 year battle was finished and I played through all of
Mega Man.

I'm amazed at how good this game is. I had always kind of thought
that the sequel was drastically better. It definitely has lots of
improvements, but this game is definitely amazing too.

I used an Infinite Lives Game Genie code so I didn't have to
Continue, etc. The spacing of checkpoints is pretty wide in this
game though, so it was nowhere near a walk in the park.

I'm very proud of myself for defeating some of the really
difficult segments. For example, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NDK1tIaNwU&amp;feature=related][beginning of Guts Man's
stage]]; the [disappearing blocks section of Ice Man's stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ8cTlCMiE4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s); and
[Yellow Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahAKcUX5PW0).

This game makes you feel like a super hero. It's awesome.

other characters is very clever and would work in almost any other
platformer I think.

<div class="entry-content">Over the last week, I played through Super Mario
Bros. 3.

The first two nights I played three worlds and then the others
took a night each. I used Game Genie codes that allow you to start
at a specific world as a form of password. I also used an infinite
lives password so I didn't have to repeat levels, but had to get
through every level as-is. I did not skip any levels.

This is a really amazing game. Although SMB2 defined SMB for me,
when I played SMB3 it really expanded what was possible. Truly a
masterpiece. It makes my thumb hurt from holding down the run
button though. :)

After dinner, I played through the rest of the game. Wily's Castle
was insane. The hardest parts were the Wily Fortress 4 and Yellow
Devil. I did Yellow Devil sooo many times and I didn't use the
Thunder Beam or the pause trick. I have to admit that used the pause
trick on the final four robot masters and Wily.

<div class="entry-content">When I was in Japan, I bought a copy of Akumajou Densetsu for the
Famicom. I knew that it did not work on my PowerPak and I had
heard that due to its special chip the game was much much better
in the Japanese version. I got it very cheap too, so it was a nice
buy.

This is a great game. I find it much much more playable than the
other two NES Castlevania games. It is still quite clunky, but not
terribly obtuse compared to those games. I gave it a
play-through.

The first night I got the first level with a great deal of
frustration as I got used to the controls. The next night I went
through the clock tower and got Grant "DaNasty". The next night I
escaped from the clock tower, went through the next level, and
went through the pirate ship. The day I went through 4 and 5 and
then at night I went through 6, 7, and I got to the end of 8.

I played through stage 8 so many times I could get through it
perfectly without getting hit at all---up until the boss that
is. I could beat the first form of Death about a fifth of the
time, but I wasn't able to beat the second form. I probably fought
him about 30 or 40 times that night with no luck. So I decided to
use a password and skip to the next level.

However, in the next level I could barely even make it to the
second block. It got to the point where the screen is just
swarming with enemies that slowly suck your life away... and you
need to make it through 3 blocks and then fight
bosses. Insanity. It's too much for me and it's not rewarding
enough.

I do like the game and I will definitely play parts of it again,
but it got to an insane point that wasn't fun... just unfair.

<div class="entry-content">When I was young, I played Baseball Stars a lot with my friend
Jeff, so I remembered it as being a great baseball game.

When I just played it last night, I didn't really understand how
to play it. I suppose I should have read the manual, but it was
very non-intuitive and as I got a few innings in to the first game
and started to understand it better, I realized that I would have
liked it to be more RPG-like if I was going to play it alone. I
imagine that playing with another person would have been a good
experience, but by myself it really didn't catch me.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the first three or four areas of The Guardian
Legend.

I was very interested in this game because of its shooter and
Metroid-vania mixed gameplay. But it was a little bit of a let
down.

The shooter parts were pretty mediocre in my mind, but I think
they were probably pretty standard and reasonable for NES shooters
of the era. The main problem with it was that it felt totally
disconnected from the rest of the game. I was hoping that it would
be integrated more.

The exploration was fun seemed to really matter and be
meaningful. I would quibble that I think the map presentation
could have been better, but I can look at it as a product of its
time.

The action was basically the same as the walking areas in Blaster
Master. Almost a Zelda perspective but projectile based. It wasn't
very appealing to me. I can recognize that it was solid, but it
didn't have the special something that capture my attention.

Overall, it's not a game I plan on going back to, but it wasn't a
waste of time to try out for a while.

<div class="entry-content">After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).

This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options---choosing different characters---is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)

I can't believe this wasn't originally a Mario game and wasn't
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.

I also use Peach by the way, she's the best.

<div class="entry-content">I'm going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn't crazy about it.

I'm not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I've played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can't deal
with it.

The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.

This was a super retro-goggle game. I didn't like it at all, but I

I found the controls to be really sloppy and the game to be too
slow. This is definitely a common complaint I have, but I want

This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,

lame. I pretty much steam-rolled the game up through the end of
Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.

<div class="entry-content">I played Clash at Demonhead for about an hour last night.

This is a really interesting action platforming game. In my mind,
that genre is defined by Mega Man and Metroid if the combat is
projectile based. The thing that is particularly interesting about
it is that it uses a Metroidvania like structure where you have a
large world that you can repeatedly explore and go through. Unlike
Metroid where the gameplay is "uniform", Clash has different modes
where you choose paths on the world map and then do a platform
level. Almost like Mega Man where you choose bosses that are
otherwise disconnected.

As I said, I played for about an hour and in that time, I didn't
really catch the vision of the open world. Instead it just felt
really confusing and mish-mashed together. It makes me wonder if I
would feel Metroid was the same way if I played it totally
fresh.

Additionally, the action is good but not as good as Metroid or
Mega Man. So I've decided to put it down for a while and maybe I
will play it again so I can give it a better chance.

<time datetime="2011-11-25T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>25</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">This afternoon I played Contra on the Famicom.

I played for about an hour and got to the end of the third stage
reliably, but couldn't take care of the boss fast enough. I played
the Japanese version so I could use stage select and start from
the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the
game. This effectively gives you infinite continues if you are
honest about not going past the point that you've gotten before. I
like infinite continue systems, provided the time in between
continue points is sufficient large. I feel like a lot of newer
games have such tiny checkpoint stretches that you can just plow
through. I realized that the reason I want to 1CC shmups is
because when you continue you start from exactly where you were
rather than the beginning of the level, so it feels really cheap
to do so.

After deciding to put it down for the day, I decided to play the
US version and use an infinite lives Game Genie code so I could
quickly play through the whole game and remember what all the
stages were like. (Since you begin a new life exactly where you
were, this allows you to plow through any problem.) It was nice to
remember what everything was like. The noises during the snow
stage were very memorable, as were the sounds of blowing up the
spiked walls in the factory.

This game is very tight and has a lot of friction, which is really
good, especially compared to some of the games that haven't stood
up very well. It's a solid game, but I think it has a few
problems. The major one is that it so wedded to the wrong arcade
sensibilities... namely cheap kills to get more
quarters. Nevertheless, this is definitely an optimal path through
most levels. For example, after a dozen or so tries, I could get
through the third stage without getting hit once. (Of course, the
boss trounced me.) I remember this game being great to play with a
friend, although in retrospect it has some bad co-op attributes:
you can kill your friend by scrolling the screen and you can too
easily steal their upgrade. Given these, I'm not sure I really
would want to play it with someone, because I wouldn't want to
make them mad.

Overall, I'm not sure I would play the game again or invest the
time to get past stage 3 honestly. The main reason is that it just
isn't a joy to play. It's fun, but it's not the giddy kind of fun
that a Mega Man 2 or Bayonetta is. It just isn't the
Ur-Run-n-Gun.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Blaster Master tonight after getting home from
Thanksgiving in SLC.

I had fond memories of reading about this game in Nintendo Power
and seeing the box art many many times. However, I don't remember
ever playing it. It's funny, I've always thought of it as a game I
played, but when I stretch, I realize I can't remember any
details. Another funny thing happened related to this game
recently. Just last night a student asked me if I knew the name of
the game with the kid and his frog that jumps in a
hole. Naturally, I said "Blaster Master!" And then I played it the
next day.

The game was very fun. The platforming is very simple. It's more
of a combat game. However, the combat is not really twitchy or
skillful. It is more a matter of being patient and taking each
enemy one at a time. I thought that I would appreciate the
"Metroid"-ness about it. But, although there is a back-tracking
and an open world. The upgrades you get feel like "keys" that are
only used once, rather than enhancements of your abilities that
you use all the time. That's a weak way to have a system like
this. Perhaps the worst part is that the final upgrade makes the
jumping feel totally off, wrong, and hard to do right because you
accidentally go under the platform you are on. The bosses are
really really hard and in most cases I resorted to dirty tricks to
get them... like going into a place where I could hit them but
they couldn't hit me. Some it was pure luck.

Nevertheless, I do stick by the game being fun, and although I
don't think I'd play it again, I would recommend it.

<div class="entry-content">I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
"hang" of it.

The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn't remember was that it really
isn't much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There's basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.

I can't say that this will go on the same "Play it again" list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.

<div class="entry-content">Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don't
remember ever beating the game.

I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn't work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.

I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can't think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.

<div class="entry-content">I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.

Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn't
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.

I will play it again, but I'll move on to the next game for
now. I've realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I'll play through it
right then, otherwise I'll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the "play in
the future" list.

<div class="entry-content">I tried to play Ikari Warriors on my Famicom. I wanted to play it
because I've heard it talked about some many times. But it was
excruciatingly slow. I couldn't tell if it was the fault of my
PowerPak or the normal behavior, but when I looked at videos
online, it didn't seem like it was normally faster. It reminded me
a little bit of Iron Tank, which I remember liking.

<div class="entry-content">This is another game that I got with my Famicom for free. This is
a very intriguing game. It feels like a mix of the original
Castlevania games with the multiple area/free-form system of Order
of Ecclesia. After playing it for about 30 minutes, I put down in
my database that I'd like to try it again. The mechanics are
strong enough, although there seem to be a bit too many annoying
sinusoidal enemies. We'll see.

<div class="entry-content">I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.

Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn't have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn't
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.

This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest... some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.

I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can't comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.

<div class="entry-content">A while ago I played Milon's Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game... which is
otherwise really opaque.

The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn't love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I'd have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don't totally love the mechanics and I can't save in between
play sessions, so I'd have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I'd seen enough.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.

This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I'm glad I
played it.

Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles

<div class="entry-content">I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon's
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.

In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.

I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn't love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.

<div class="entry-content">I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell... a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!

<div class="entry-content">I played Yie Ar Kung-Fu for my Famicom tonight. I got it when I

It's not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy's skull and it doesn't register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.

But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.

low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.

I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.

However, other than number 9, I've never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Zelda II: The Adventure of Link over a few
nights. The first night I got familiar with the game and leveled a
bit. The next night I beat the first palace and explored up to the
second palace. I didn't play for a while and then I played again
tonight. I played through to the sixth palace and got to the
boss. I died in my first fight with the boss and decided to put
the game down for the night. However, when I reset the cart so
that I could save the SRAM on my PowerPak it said that there was a
fatal error and I couldn't backup the SRAM. When I turned it back
on, I had lost my save data.

I had one boss and the last dungeon between me and the end of the
game. I declare it a draw. Maybe I'll try again some day, but it
is so debilitating to have to redo so much.

I don't remember playing this game as much as the first Zelda when
I was younger. I remember the first palace and the general style
of the game very much, but I don't remember making a lot of
progress or being very attached to it. When I played through this
time, I thought it was fun.

It has a reputation for being very difficult. I thought it was
about the same difficulty, but there were some things that were
different enough to feel harder. For example, after losing all
your lives, you don't continue at the place where you are, you go
back to the start of the whole game and it may be a long walk
back. This feels quite frustrating. Another thing is that a lot of
the enemies are cheap NES mobs that soak up a lot of damage and
seem impossible to every really connect with (the many shield
enemies are like this.) Finally, there are
Castlevania-Medusea-esque floating heads that knock you off a jump
when you are going over lava pits. Arrggh. There are some things
that seem easier, like the opportunity to level and cast spells
and that you can easily get all your health/magic back outside a
dungeon.

I definitely enjoyed the game and it will be on my long-run
rotation.

the boss, so I could get a good 2-player ending.

I love this game. I remember playing it sooo many times with my
brother as a kid. It's really great. I don't remember some of the
levels being so hard and I don't remember ever beating the boss,
although I get the impression that I did.

It felt very good to conquer this game. I highly recommend it to
everyone. I'm looking forward to playing it with the *REDACTED* and the

I remember playing this a lot as a kid, although when I was young
I would mostly make tracks with tons and tons of jumps, rather
than actually playing the races. In fact, when I started to play
recently I didn't even know about the two different acceleration
buttons, although I quickly figured it out and did okay.

It's a pretty fun game, but I like modern racing games better. In
a lot of cases (i.e. sports games) I like the older, more abstract
games better, but in this case I think that it is a bit too
simplistic for my current tastes.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Metroid over the past few days. (I started on the
10th, got the majority of the items and killed Kraid. Then the
next day I got two missile tanks and got to Ridley's zone. Then
today I finished Ridley's zone and finished the game.)

This is another game that I remember very fondly as a kid. I
remember using my dad's maps and playing through it a lot, and
then discovering the JUSTIN BAILEY code and using it a lot too. I
don't remember ever beating it though, or even really doing very
good or getting very far.

I think the problem when I was young is that I didn't have the
patience to grind out health to refill all the tanks that I got;
whereas playing through the game this time, I spent a lot of time
doing that to be prepared for the enemies. If you are willing to
do that, the game gets a lot easier.

The final area with the Metroids and Mother Brain is brutal
though. Much much harder than any other part of the game. The
Metroids practically instantly kill you if they catch you. I had
to play through it quite a few times.

Overall, this game totally survived replaying and remains as
awesome in my mind as I've always thought.

<div class="entry-content">I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley's Castle
today.

I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don't
remember ever getting to Wiley's Castle, and especially not
through it. I'm kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don't normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I'm just remembering it being harder than
it was? I'm not sure.

Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man's
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.

Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don't
think there's anything that isn't polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.

This game is amazing.

I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try---I only
used one potion too.

I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn't shoot arrows (they consume money.)

It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don't remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad's map.

I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult---much more so than modern Zelda games---but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn't
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.

I'm very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.

<div class="entry-content">This sounded like a really cool game: a combination of a shooter
and an adventure game where you travel through connected stages,
etc. Unfortunately, I found it impossible to understand what I was
supposed to do. I intend to give it another chance, maybe after
reading a manual, but I couldn't cope with it when I tried it the
first time.

<time datetime="2010-05-23T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>23</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content">I've just finished Ninja Gaiden for the NES. It was great to use
an authentic controller for it. It was also great to be able to
use save states because the game is so hard.

I really like the simple and straight-forward controls. I love
the arcade/shmup-like patterns and difficulties. Even though with
modern games, I loathe lame cut-scenes over boring stories, I find
them really entertaining in this game, because they are so
simplistic. The music and sound-effects overall are nice, in that
8-bit way.

For the first four acts (there are six), I limited myself to
one save state per screen. This was a significant challenge. When
I got to the fifth act, it was so tough that I was tempted by the
save states and used them after each obstacle. Each of the final
bosses (there are three) was defeated by using a save after each
hit I landed. Nevertheless, I feel very satisfied that I have been
able to get through the game, because even severely disadvantaging
it, it was very hard.

I'm looking forward to playing the sequel. If I play it again,
I will use save states much less to force myself to gain more
skill at the game.

<div class="entry-content">Over the past month I've been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn't remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she's been waiting a long time for me.

I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the
second quest.
