    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got to the boss of stage 2 after playing for about 35
minutes. I've heard about this game many times before and I had
much greater expectations about how crazy and silly it would
be. I thought the bosses I fought were very cool, but overall, it
wasn't too crazy.</p>

<p>The mechanics are very reasonable for its time... it's just
Gradius. My only problem with it is that the NES is not a good
system for it: it has really atrocious and not intentional
slow-down; the sprite flicker is really bad and makes it hard to
see enemy bullets; and, the game lacks the vibrancy that it seems
like it should have. I'm also quite spoiler by CAVE when it comes
to being able to distinguish enemy bullets from mine and seeing
the hit box of the character easily.</p>

<p>I will try the other Parodius games rather than invest any more
time in this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These TECHNOS games feel so good. I like the dynamics in this
game and the way it feels great to tackle your opponent. I really
enjoy more abstract sports games like this. I don't know if I
wouldn't like the more modern, realistic sports games... I
presume I wouldn't, but I haven't really played them. One thing
about this game though, is that I don't think it could sustain
playing it for a long sitting. I played for a little more than
thirty minutes and that seems like the right amount of time. I
think I will keep at it and beat it... maybe?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played and beat this game tonight. I found it to be less
ridiculously hard than the first one because I found the powerups
and ninja power recharges to be more available. The environmental
hazards (wind, darkness, etc) were really rough. The cinema
sequences are way too long. I found confirmation in this
play-through of something that James Rolfe said in AVGN: you
forget that there is a health bar in this game, because you only
normally die by being whacked off platforms when you get
hit. It's so true. Also, the powerup that shoots fire diagonally
upwards is soooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about two and half hours. A little more
than the final hour was spent on the last level trying to get up
the vertical passage with the gears. It was unbearably
brutalizing. If you could just shoot up or if the jump were a
little bit more controllable, I could have done it. But I decided
that I was interested in the ending that much.</p>

<p>Overall, this game is feels really great. The different weapons
are all useful and fun. The jumping is pretty nice and the
wall-hanging works much better than in Ninja Gaiden. Surprisingly
good!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through Skull Man's stage tonight (my son is very
fascinated with his appearance.) It was a fun level and I managed
to get an E tank and lots of 1-UPs on it. I had 4 lives for the
boss fight but was totally destroyed. I feel like in these later
Mega Man games, it is impossible to beat bosses out of
order. It's a bit disappointing that it isn't as free, but it
doesn't detract that much from the experience.</p>
