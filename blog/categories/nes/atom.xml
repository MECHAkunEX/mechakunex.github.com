    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing this regularly for so long and I've never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kids and I played this for a bit today. We did Needle Man and
couldn't do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn't get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried again. I lost against Honda the first try and then won in
the first round with my first knock down (it was interrupting his
special move.) I got a few hits on Soda Popinski, but then lost.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to show the wife this game and have her try it out. She
beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me
show her how it was done. She lost on the next fight but I took
the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son and I played through Snake Man's level, then started
Hard Man. He thought Snake Man was very cool. He said, at the
beginning of the level, "Is this Snake Man's body?" because it
looked like a Snake. He's very cute when he watches me play Mega
Man.</p>
