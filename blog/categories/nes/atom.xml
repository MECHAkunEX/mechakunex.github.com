    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kiddo wanted to have me play this today because he likes Cut
Man so much. I creamed Cut Man: one death on the way, one death at
the fight. Next we did Ice Man I got through the disappearing
blocks really easily, but fell off on the floating platforms and
got a Game Over. Then it was time to give the monkeys lunch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I listened to the <a href="http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380">Crunk Games</a> Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
"Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill." They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless "put in the hours" work and study
experiences. I've heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that's what I don't like about
them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son wanted to see this played again today. We decided that my
wife would play (her first time) and she'd go against Metal
Man. It took her about 6 continues, but she eventually beat the
level. She used an E tank on the boss and got him on her first
try. Go team!</p>
