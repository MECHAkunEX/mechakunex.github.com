    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls &amp; bats. It was cute.</p>

<p>I think I will play it again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my son wanted to play this real bad rather than Mega Man X
(which we've been playing for a while.) So we did it. We played
through the whole game. I got stuck pretty bad on the Wily
Machine, but other than that I walked through the game pretty
easily. I happened to choose a really nice order for the levels
so I had a lot of good items and weapons during the levels. It
was really fun to go through the whole game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have this cartridge and my son thinks the box art is cool. We
played today for a little and I beat the first level... which I
haven't done any of the last four or five times he's wanted to
see the game. I feel like it's a pretty brutal game, because most
animals (and Nemo) have no offense abilities.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I play this while my son watched today. I spent twenty minutes
going through Stone Man's stage. I got to him and was doing pretty
well, but the Mega Buster wasn't powerful enough against him. The
spinning things are the worst... they crowd you and you can't
shoot them while they are touching you. It stinks, you have to
draw them away and then jump n shoot them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing this regularly for so long and I've never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that's probably just being a sore
loser.</p>
