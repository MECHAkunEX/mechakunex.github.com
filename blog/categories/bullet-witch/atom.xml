    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game... how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It's pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting---objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.</p>

<p>I'm at a point in my life where it's not worth it to read books
I'm not interested in, finish movies that I don't love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren't rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I'd like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I'll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.</p>
