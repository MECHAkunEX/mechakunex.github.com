<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.</p>

<p>After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I&#8217;d never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really played a third-person
shooter. I&#8217;ve played third-person platform games with a little
shooting&#8212;like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I&#8217;ve
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I&#8217;ve certainly never played
anything in the modern &#8220;cover-based&#8221; shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.</p>

<p>I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very &#8220;real&#8221; and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a &#8220;squad&#8221; most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn&#8217;t really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.</p>

<p>The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans&#8212;just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though&#8212;however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn&#8217;t bothered
at all.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I&#8217;m an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.</p>

<p>There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there&#8217;s a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards&#8212;as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the &#8220;cheap&#8221;
one-hit kills. For example, if you don&#8217;t destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don&#8217;t see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
&#8220;Unknown&#8221; enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack&#8212;over and
over. Yikes.</p>

<p>I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint&#8212;I
effectively &#8220;1cc&#8217;d&#8221; the game. Here are my stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77</p>

<p>I wish I could&#8217;ve kept track of the total time I played. (The
&#8220;Mission Time&#8221; is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.</p>

<p>While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don&#8217;t feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played&#8230; nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.</p>

<p>Hoorah!</p>
