<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.</p>

<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing&#8212;I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the &#8220;Time = Progress&#8221; equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn&#8217;t worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn&#8217;t going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.</p>

<p>The character progression system was fun&#8212;on the surface&#8212;it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone&#8217;s class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn&#8217;t love it enough
to really get into that.</p>

<p>I pretty much ignored the &#8220;quests&#8221; because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn&#8217;t do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don&#8217;t
love the game, I&#8217;m not taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren&#8217;t really for the solo player I
typically am.</p>

<p>The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I&#8217;ve briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.</p>

<p>Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn&#8217;t really pay of either.</p>

<p>On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.</p>

<p>I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character&#8217;s appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It&#8217;s funny how
close it goes to the JRPG clich√© of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I&#8217;ll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.</p>
