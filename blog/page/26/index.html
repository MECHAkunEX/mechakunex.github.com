  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really interesting &#8220;political intrigue&#8221; style
episode. I think my favourite thing is how Gaius is always
presented as the bad guy, but he&#8217;s so right most of the time. It
is really fascinating. I always wonder what some kinds of people
do all day&#8230; like the people who were actors or retailers or
other jobs that can&#8217;t really exist anymore. I like the Chief&#8217;s
point that they should be doing odd jobs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was another character development episode. Neat, but nothing
super exciting. It&#8217;s nice to have these slower ones to remind you
of the characters quirks. The airlock jump was really
nerve-wracking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode about space racism. That plot
line was kind of cool, but I was hoping that there would be more
to the brief appearance we saw of Caprica Six.</p>

<p>On the subject of space racism, I think it is strange how whole
planets are casually stereotyped in the show. This is very common
thing in science fiction, but it really doesn&#8217;t make sense. Given
how diverse opinions and culture are on our planet, it seems
strange to expect it to be any different. The only thing BSG has
on its side is that the planet were originally colonized by
(presumably) culturally homogenous &#8220;tribes&#8221; and thus could have
maintained their distinct (and cohesive) identities; although
that seems like a stretch given the length of time the colonies
existed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I loved this episode because I&#8217;m so fascinated by Baltar. I wish
he would get a break. He&#8217;s really not terrible.</p>

<p>Before this episode, I was thinking about the show and how
sketchy their information about the past, and in particular,
Kobol, is. It doesn&#8217;t make sense that if their ancestors could
travel through space, they also wouldn&#8217;t keep detailed records
that would give much more information. It&#8217;s inconsistent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior 3 over the past week and a half.</p>

<p>My opinions on this game are very similar to DW1 and DW2. This
much more mechanically strong that DW2 but not as much of a leap
as DW2 was over DW1. I enjoyed the class changing system.</p>

<p>I used anti-grinding Game Genie codes to limit the amount I had to
do it&#8212;one gave me more XP and the other more GP. The combat
system gets pretty old, especially with random monsters. Fighting
the bosses is typically really fun.</p>

<p>I also played with a guide, so I didn&#8217;t have to figure out where I
needed to go myself, but I got the impression that it was much
less obscure than DW2, but not as clear as even a SNES-era game.</p>

<p>For these two reasons, I definitely didn&#8217;t get a true DW3
experience, although I&#8217;m willing to bet that I wouldn&#8217;t want that
experience. Instead, I just enjoyed the story.</p>

<p>The connection to the other games is easily the coolest part of
this and really comes out of nowhere, but makes complete sense
after the fact. I thought it was also really cool how you run into
your father right at the end. It&#8217;s really neat.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the first truly played DW game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There were so many fascinating things in this episode. Anyone who
has seen it would agree. The things that are most interesting to
me are that they&#8217;ve consolidated the characters all back on
Galactica&#8212;Gaius, Caprica Six, Hera, etc. And it&#8217;s very
surprising that they&#8217;ve totally killed off a Cylon model. It
seems a bit too transparent of a way to remove an actress. I have
a hard time believing the Cylons would really do it. Although I
suppose it&#8217;s imaginable that in the longer run one model who take
control of all the others and make itself the only active one.</p>

<p>I think we are meant to think that Starbuck is one of the final
five or something because she&#8217;s been greatly wronged by the
Cylons and apparently has had this vision. I&#8217;m disappointed that
Gaius didn&#8217;t seem to learn anything from being in the temple.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really liked this episode. It was cool to have the Cylons and
the humans interact directly again. It was really cool to learn
more about the religion/history of the humans. It was very
surprising that Gaius and Caprica Six are on the splits. I&#8217;m
fascinated to find out what Gaius and Three are up to. I&#8217;m very
intrigued by what will happen with Athena. I feel like we are now
starting the arc that will go all the way to the end of the
season.</p>
