  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I played Snatcher, Hideo Kojima&#8217;s second video game, for
the Sega CD. I&#8217;m a huge fan of his Metal Gear series and I&#8217;ve
always heard of how cool /Snatcher/ was, so I finally got around
to playing it.</p>

<p>The gameplay isn&#8217;t very deep. The puzzles and adventure game-style
fetching is pretty basic. The shooting scenes are trivial and
mostly unnecessary. But, the story and presentation is pretty
amazing, particularly if you can put your mind back in the late
80s/early 90s. You can really see how it fits into his overall
career in terms of the style, some of the core ideas, and the
&#8220;feel&#8221; of the story. For example, Kojima is very good at
suggesting that there is a deeper interesting world behind his
games; a few instances of this I liked were the subtle references
to genetically modified pets and Martian mining. A few other
things I really enjoyed were the references to other video games
at the time in the night club and to pop-culture, e.g. talking
about &#8220;Michael Jaxson&#8221; and how he is strange. The game also makes
me appreciate /Metal Gear Solid 4/&#8217;s Metal Gear Mk.II&#8212;in
/Snatcher/ your assistant has the same name and looks roughly the
same too.</p>

<p>It was a good history lesson and I enjoyed it, but I shouldn&#8217;t
have stayed up so late. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first game I decided to play with my new Sega Saturn was
Panzer Dragoon. When I first owned a Saturn, I bought Panzer
Dragoon Saga, but I didn&#8217;t appreciate its uniqueness. I assumed it
would just be a normal JRPG and I don&#8217;t really remember getting
that into it.</p>

<p>I decided to play this game because I enjoyed Sin and Punishment
so much. I assumed that /Panzer/ would be an Ur-Sin and
Punishment. It&#8217;s strange because I didn&#8217;t appreciate this game for
the same reason I didn&#8217;t appreciate /Saga/ when I was younger:
different expectations.</p>

<p>The core gameplay of /Panzer/ is definitely fun and
a forebear of a kind of game that I really like, however, a lot of
things didn&#8217;t work for me. The controls left a lot to be desired,
it was very easy to accidentally swing the camera more than the
number of arcs you intended and I never felt in control of the
dragon&#8217;s position on the screen, so it was hard to avoid
obstacles, etc. There is a severe lack of contrast between the
enemies (and their bullets) and the background, so it is hard to
tell what you need to shoot at or avoid. These two mechanical
problems were pretty big deal breakers for me. The main difficulty
I felt playing it was dealing with the systems, rather than an
actual hurdle I needed to bring myself over. (This is, of course,
a classic critique of many old games, but I think it fits this one
appropriately because the exact gameplay has been done well in
other places.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was a lot to enjoy about the game. First,
the story is pretty epic. One of my favourite things, however, is
that the story explains why you don&#8217;t control the path of the
Dragon (i.e., why it is on rails): you&#8217;re not the true rider, he
died and you happened to be there, his last words: &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8230;let
him [his killer] go back to The Tower&#8230;my dragon&#8230;knows the
way&#8230;&#8221; Brilliant. Second, many of the level setups are really
inspired and spectacular. The first was the giant sandworms in the
second level. Gorgeous. The next was the boss in the third level:
you have to dodge vertically these rotating fans. It worked really
well and was different from the earlier segments. (BTW, I
mentioned it was hard to dodge in general, but it was definitely
easier vertically.) The next was the fourth level. Flying through
the tiny tunnels makes you feel like Luke Skywalker taking out the
Death Star. Also brilliant.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that I would have loved this game when it first
came out, but it is not worth it (for me) to spend my time
perfecting my performance in it. I will definitely play the
sequels, however.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)</p>

<p>I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc&#8217;d the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the <a href="http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=23025">shmups forum</a>
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.</p>

<p>So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a YouTube link to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=mushih">videos of the game</a>. It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I played the next day and one life&#8217;d it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned, I&#8217;ve been playing Radilgy on my Dreamcast. In my
last post, I wrote about how I wasn&#8217;t sure how much longer I would
play it. Well, I think I&#8217;m pretty satisfied now.</p>

<p>I know that I /could/ get better, but I think I would rather move
on. In the past week, since my first win, I&#8217;ve beaten it three
more times. My first win was on Easy with 5 lives per continue. My
second was on Normal with 5 lives per continue. My third was on
Normal with 4 lives per continue. And my fourth (completed about 5
minutes ago) was on Normal with 3 lives per continue (the default
setting.)</p>

final2, 2-3:5 final2, 1-1:5 final2, 1-2:5 final2, WIN!</p>

<p>I started recording just wins with the configuration. Then I added
when I died. Then I tracked when I spent each /i/th
continue. (I switched to when I spent continue number /i/,
because it was easier to eye-ball.) I recorded particularly
depressing losses when the final form of the final boss was almost
dead. Finally today, I kept track of when I lost each life. Also
today I switched from using the Wide shot to using the 123
Laser. My impression is that one weapon isn&#8217;t more powerful than
another, but that they represent different play styles. I realized
today that I was focusing my shots at a single enemy typically, so
I might as well use the weapon that corresponds to that style. The
main difference I observed was being able to take care of the boss
a little faster.</p>

<p>This process I&#8217;ve just gone through&#8212;training and recording
performance&#8212;makes me think about features I would like in a
shooter. Here&#8217;s a few:
- <em>Data!</em> I wish the game would keep track of all the data I was
tracking by hand so I could find out where I was dying a lot and
where I needed to practice. It would even be nicer if the
granularity of this data was very fine; for example, I&#8217;d like to
know that I always die on the third attack of the fourth
mini-boss.
- <em>Progress-based Scoreboard</em> I&#8217;d like to be able to sort my
scoreboard (+ the public one in modern games) by how far in the
game/level the score was completed at. For example, I&#8217;m
currently working on 1cc-ing Ikaruga and doing chapter 3
Dot-Eater style. I&#8217;m not playing for score, so I&#8217;d like to be
able to (at a glance) see if I&#8217;ve gotten further than I have
before.
- <em>Practice modes</em> Most games are pretty good about allowing you
to practice chapters you&#8217;ve unlocked and some (Ikaruga on
Gamecube, for example) allow you to practice individual chapter
stages. I&#8217;d like this to be more common and with finer
granularity.
- <em>Trainer</em> Even better than a practice mode would be a mode where
the game planned your practice regime based on your previous
game performance. It would be rad also if you could loop bosses
or bullet patterns until you got through them without having to
go through all of the surrounding game.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there&#8217;s something very satisfying about playing the
beginning of a game so many times you can destroy it without
mercy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been hearing more and more about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>, the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/">GiantBomb</a> previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml">what he loved</a> and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn&#8217;t
love]]. And this morning I listened to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689">Active Time Babble</a> talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.</p>

<p>I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.</p>

<p>A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- <em>Challenging Battles:</em> Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I&#8217;ve also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- <em>Controlled Progression:</em> ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn&#8217;t unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can&#8217;t accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I&#8217;ll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- <em>Controlled Cast:</em> ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don&#8217;t have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact <em>in
character</em> in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don&#8217;t think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don&#8217;t use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don&#8217;t actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I&#8217;m excited about
that.
- <em>Linear Progression:</em> ATB mentioned that you can&#8217;t unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- <em>Post-game:</em> The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you&#8217;ve already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>For giggles, I&#8217;ll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can&#8217;t think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don&#8217;t think 11 really
counts anyways. I&#8217;d like to do 8 and 9 again.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently bought a Dreamcast. The very first game I played was
The Typing of the Dead, but I only played it for a few minutes to
show to Wifey. The very first game I played in depth is &lt;a
Radilgy, a shmup.</p>

<p>The art style is really unique and good looking. The controllers
are quite tight. The weapons are fun. (I really like the lasers
and the bubbles. I play most of the time with the lasers though.)
The shield, sword, and force field are nice touches.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth levels have these segments that require
spamming the force field over and over and over. (At least, that&#8217;s
how I do it!) It is pretty insane. Each of the end bosses is
really fun. The mid-level bosses are a little repetitive, because
they have the same core attacks, but they fit well and create a
nice feel for the game. (As I understand from the Wikipedia story,
those are the terrorists and the end bosses are warped
robots.)</p>

<p>My one complaint with the game is that the graphics are so
bright and there is so much flashing that it becomes hard to look
at after a while. I&#8217;ve been playing in 20-ish minute chunks then
doing something else.</p>

<p>I just beat it on Easy with 6 credits and 5 life credits using the
laser. I&#8217;ve been working on a number of different
configurations. I don&#8217;t like it when shmups have so many options,
because I don&#8217;t have a good grasp of what the &#8220;right&#8221; options
are. There is also a big temptation to make it easier, etc. I
wonder, should I try to 1cc it on Easy, then Normal, then Hard? Or
just got right to a different difficulty, etc? I can use 1 credit
to get to the middle of stage 3 (the mini-boss) on Normal. I&#8217;ve
gotten through stages 1 and 2 without ever dying as well. How
should I go about it? I plan on definitely playing for a little
while, but I don&#8217;t want to make it a permanent pursuit like
/Ikaruga/.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.</p>

<p>I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don&#8217;t remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you&#8217;re supposed to stop the music but
you can&#8217;t hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.</p>

<p>Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that&#8217;s what the
rest of the game will be like, I&#8217;m not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn&#8217;t seem that way and it didn&#8217;t seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn&#8217;t imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.</p>

<p>I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I&#8217;m quite picky, but because I&#8217;m so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recommend it. But I didn&#8217;t finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.</p>

<p>Frustrating, boring mechanic</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I&#8217;d played
it a few times about my brother-in-law&#8217;s house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren&#8217;t adjustable and the defaults don&#8217;t work
as well on the stick. Bummer.</p>

<p>I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay&#8230; like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.</p>

<p>Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.</p>

<p>Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I&#8217;ve ever played.</p>

<p>I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.</p>

<p>I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn&#8217;t use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don&#8217;t want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don&#8217;t want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don&#8217;t regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.</p>

<p>There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.</p>

<p>Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.</p>
