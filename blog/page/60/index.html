  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a cross between Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania but with
terrible art and really loose, sloppy game play. Reading about the
game on Wikipedia makes it seem so cool, but the mechanics are
just way too bad to push through to what sounds like it would be
good. I have no connection in my history to this game, so it is
easy to say &#8220;Who cares?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I don&#8217;t seem the type, but I really liked sports games on
the NES and SNES. In particular, I have very fond memories of
baseball games. I got the Japanese version of this game with my
Famicom, so I popped it in and played a few innings. It is
definitely a very weak and primitive game. I will try the later
versions though, because maybe it got tighter and faster.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.</p>

<p>Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn&#8217;t
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I will play it again, but I&#8217;ll move on to the next game for
now. I&#8217;ve realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I&#8217;ll play through it
right then, otherwise I&#8217;ll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the &#8220;play in
the future&#8221; list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to play Ikari Warriors on my Famicom. I wanted to play it
because I&#8217;ve heard it talked about some many times. But it was
excruciatingly slow. I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was the fault of my
PowerPak or the normal behavior, but when I looked at videos
online, it didn&#8217;t seem like it was normally faster. It reminded me
a little bit of Iron Tank, which I remember liking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is another game that I got with my Famicom for free. This is
a very intriguing game. It feels like a mix of the original
Castlevania games with the multiple area/free-form system of Order
of Ecclesia. After playing it for about 30 minutes, I put down in
my database that I&#8217;d like to try it again. The mechanics are
strong enough, although there seem to be a bit too many annoying
sinusoidal enemies. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.</p>

<p>Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.</p>

<p>This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest&#8230; some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can&#8217;t comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago I played Milon&#8217;s Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game&#8230; which is
otherwise really opaque.</p>

<p>The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn&#8217;t love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I&#8217;d have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don&#8217;t totally love the mechanics and I can&#8217;t save in between
play sessions, so I&#8217;d have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I&#8217;d seen enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.</p>

<p>This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I&#8217;m glad I
played it.</p>

<p>Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles</p>
