  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn&#8217;t get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played two times today. The first time for about 45 minutes and
I got to Stage 9. I found it incredibly difficult to get past the
bone pillars&#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.</p>

<p>I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don&#8217;t like
that I can&#8217;t restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad&#8230; my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cool movie. The effects were awesome and the
embellishments of the story, particularly the relationship of the
Evil Queen and her brother, were really cool. Kristen Stewart was
beautiful in it and played the part very well. I thought she was
awkward fighting, but feel like it was purposeful. Definitely a
fun movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man&#8217;s
stage. She killed a penguin! She&#8217;s getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time&#8230; something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn&#8217;t have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult&#8212;basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It&#8217;s similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you&#8217;re basically toast.</p>

<p>The part I got to, where there&#8217;s Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it&#8217;s super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It&#8217;s a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn&#8217;t do
any of the combat ones. I&#8217;m really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I&#8217;m moving it away from myself. It&#8217;s
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the &#8220;stealth&#8221; mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the &#8220;recharging&#8221; missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don&#8217;t feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I&#8217;m pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren&#8217;t precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I&#8217;ll probably get used to it as I play. It&#8217;s a fun little
game&#8230; definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn&#8217;t have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>
