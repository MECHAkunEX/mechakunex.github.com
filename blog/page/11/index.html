deep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml">Destructoid</a> - I like the review.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/">Edge</a> - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won&#8217;t get
you that.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php">Christian Nutt in Gamasutra</a> - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn&#8217;t need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/">2D-X Diaries</a> - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;ve beat the game and 100%&#8217;d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect&#8212;there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor&#8212;a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.</p>

<p>FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem&#8212;the UI is much better in ways you wouldn&#8217;t
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun &amp; diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
&#8220;mechanics&#8221;, much better, in fact.</p>

<p>There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the &#8220;drive&#8221; of the
characters&#8212;escape&#8212;consumes all story bandwidth.</p>

<p>But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn&#8217;t even re-use every environment and there didn&#8217;t seem to
be very much from the &#8220;whole game of content&#8221; that was cut
from 13.</p>

<p>However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don&#8217;t think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn&#8217;t feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.</p>

<p>This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn&#8217;t pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content&#8212;the super hard bosses, like FF13&#8217;s missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.</p>

<p>In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13&#8217;s 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.</p>

<p>Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope&#8212;other than To Be Continued&#8212;that would&#8217;ve
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I&#8217;d hope for a bit more
improvements.</p>

<p>I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, Boomer is a low down good fer nothin&#8217;. I totally predicted
that Kara&#8217;s piano playing friend was her dad and that he wasn&#8217;t
real. Given that he played that song, it makes me wonder if like
her dad was the only living &#8220;Daniel&#8221; Cylon&#8212;you know, the
artist. Because if he doesn&#8217;t enter the plot in some way, why
would they tell us about him in the first place, given that it
wasn&#8217;t really that informative about something else. (Maybe just
that Cavil is a punk.) Also, at the beginning of this episode I
was thinking about how Cavil has been missing most of the season,
at least since the hub was destroyed, and that he doesn&#8217;t really
have plans that they are getting involved in. There&#8217;s only two
episodes left!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I play this a bit pretty much every time I got to the
bathroom. I&#8217;m stuck at a pretty standard score&#8212;I can get to the
first few red enemies. I still feel like the game&#8217;s control would
be so much better with real buttons, etc. I&#8217;ve noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/">This interesting review</a> has some

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am looking for more monsters&#8230; on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I&#8217;ll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy&#8212;I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I&#8217;m kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don&#8217;t want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I&#8217;ll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It&#8217;s weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn&#8217;t see any extra scene&#8230; will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits&#8230; that&#8217;s it&#8230; so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there&#8217;s no harder monsters to challenge, so it&#8217;s like it isn&#8217;t
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn&#8217;t acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We didn&#8217;t watch for as long as I hoped today&#8230; just one
episode. It was a really good episode though. I like the struggle
they are having about using support from the Cylons. I continue
to be fascinated by Gaius and what he is going to do. I love it
when he just says whatever Figment Six tells him to. I&#8217;m kind of
surprised what happened with Ellen. It seems even too low for
her. During this episode, I remembered something from the
Colonial Scriptures&#8230; it said that the 13th tribe was pursued by
demons. We were originally meant to assume that this was the
Cylons, but it appears that it was really not. I think it was
humans who later attacked them (as I said above.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had the worst experience playing this game ever. It lost my
progress from last time so I had to do a five level sequence over
again. It was unbearable. I noticed that this game has a much
worse UI than Meat Boy. For example, it is infuriating to have to
save every five levels and that it didn&#8217;t work and that you need
to press A to revive and that you can&#8217;t watch replays. Annoying!</p>

Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the &#8220;last time on
FF13-2&#8221;, it shows Lightning saying &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you to keep hope
alive&#8221;. It was &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you to keep Hope alive&#8221;, then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn&#8217;t on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There&#8217;s a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool&#8212;especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the &#8220;real/good&#8221; ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. &#8220;The Future
is Hope&#8221; ending is strange because it seems like the &#8220;true&#8221;
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good&#8212;but it&#8217;s very anti-climatic&#8230; although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: &#8220;A new adventure was just beginning&#8212;the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!&#8221; Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough&#8230; it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn&#8217;t been any explanation given of why Snow is a l&#8217;Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower&#8211;The A.Z Files&#8212;reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
