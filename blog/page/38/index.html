  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.</p>

<p>This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and &#8220;flip&#8221; on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the &#8220;hardest&#8221;
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here&#8217;s a video of someone else doing it:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&amp;feature=related">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my end-game stats:</p>

<p>Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19</p>

<p>Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189</p>

<p>Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it&#8217;s easy to play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that&#8217;s how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction &#8220;mysteries&#8221; are simply crazy
things you can&#8217;t possible know until they come out of left
field. I&#8217;m glad this game wasn&#8217;t like that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Kid Dracula for the Gameboy. It&#8217;s a very straight-forward
platformer with a shooting mechanic. It has a little bonus
mechanic of different kinds of magic that let Kid Dracula turn
into a bat, walk on the ceiling, use a protective umbrella,
etc. Most of these things are only useful in a few places in the
eight level game, but they are present enough to make it fun to
use them. The best part about the game, however, is the clever cut
parody of the Castlevania series. Most of the common enemies show
up in super-cute form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve played through Cave Story on the
PC. (It has recently been re-released in an updated form for
WiiWare.)</p>

<p>It has a very unique and fun mix of Mega Man, Metroid, and
Adventure-style game play. I played through the &#8220;Hard&#8221; version of
the game where you get Booster 2.0 and I played through the &#8220;Hell&#8221;
final area as well.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it. It is free to download and it&#8217;s very
fun. It inspires me to work more often on my game ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of the past two-ish months, I&#8217;ve played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It&#8217;s kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It&#8217;s quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don&#8217;t get as many
lives/bombs during it.)</p>

<p>I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn&#8217;t registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)</p>

<p>Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540</p>

<p>Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Final Fantasy 13, I wanted to play something really
light. Katamari Damacy was a good choice. It&#8217;s crazy, bizarre, and
really fun. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about it over the past few years and
I was glad to be able to try it out.</p>

<p>I really like the way you collect countries in the ending
sequence. It&#8217;s funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Final Fantasy 13 for another 26 hours (making 88
total.) I got all the trophies except the incredibly tedious ones
(getting all other trophies, getting all items, getting 5 stars on
every mission, and beating a Long Gui.) This made me almost hate
this game.</p>

<p>The post-game is much more tedious than previous games. Completing
all the missions was very fun, but the grinding for money was
horrible. I did enough to get 4 Ultimate Weapons and max out 2 of
them. I see no justification for how stingy the game is.</p>

<p>I would&#8217;ve much /much/ rather played the main game in a New Game
Plus mode with higher money drop rates so I could re-view the
story and work through getting all the items.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post, I will &#8220;respond&#8221; to articles on the Internet about
FF13. I&#8217;ve been delaying reading any until after I beat, so I
think now is the appropriate time. I will do my best to not be a
rabid fan boy about it. My goal is to capture my reactions to new
ideas I read elsewhere, rather than to argue anyone who disagrees
with my preferences.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630">Tim Rogers</a>. This review is hilarious, as all his are. (He curses a
lot by the way.) Here&#8217;s a great quote: &#8220;The idea of the game is
that the characters all look like people who someone would want to
cosplay; they all act like characters who would be someone’s
favorite character.&#8221; His discussion of the battle system is spot
on. I suppose the big difference is that I love it and he
doesn&#8217;t. Same with launching enemies into the air. Here&#8217;s
something that is quite true:</p>

<blockquote><p>The battles will sometimes envelop you in<br/>sometimes ten entire minutes of grueling uphill climbing, forcing<br/>you to know that you’re doing something wrong. You pray for a<br/>zero-star ranking, for there to be some obvious “right way” to do<br/>this. Then the game gives you a five-star ranking, and your heart<br/>sinks: oh god, you are doing it the right way.</p></blockquote>


<p>Just read his comment about the monsters not looking like
anything. That&#8217;s true and its always been that way. I&#8217;m totally in
his &#8220;that&#8217;s the way things are&#8221; camp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-167136.phtml">Jim Sterling</a>. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a hardcore Final Fantasy XIII fan, prone
to emotional outburts and so defensive of Square Enix&#8217;s latest
effort that you&#8217;ll get upset by harsh criticism, then you&#8217;re
advised to not read this review. If you don&#8217;t want to see somebody
tear this game limb from limb, or are upset by videogame review in
general, then you should definitely not read it.&#8221; I can see why
someone would be upset at his review, but I&#8217;m not in the
least. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-joys-of-being-a-videogame-reviewer-167383.phtml">I&#8217;m amazed at how people react to him</a>.</p>

<p>I read a bunch of other reviews but didn&#8217;t really feel like
commenting on any of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>I love this game.</h1>

<p>I bought /Final Fantasy 13/ on release day&#8212;the first
time I&#8217;ve bought a game on release day in years&#8212;and I&#8217;ve been
playing it constantly ever since. Yesterday I beat the story, so I
think it is an appropriate time to talk about the game. I imagine
that I will have more thoughts after the end-game, but I&#8217;ll leave
those for a second post.</p>

<p>First, a note of warning, in this post I will talk about things
that I consider spoilers. However, keep in mind that I have cut
myself off from all video game related discussions during the past
20 days as I&#8217;ve been playing the game, so my spoiler threshold is
fairly low.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off with a little bit of numbers to give context to
somethings I talk about later. The game has 13 chapters. I spent
about 20 hours playing chapters 1 through 10. I spent about 20
hours in chapter 11. I spent about 12 hours playing chapter 12
and 13. The game is totally linear during until
chapter 11. Chapters 12 and 13 are also totally linear, but there
is an &#8220;escape&#8221; valve to go back to the non-linear chapter 11
area. I viewed this escape route as a way to grind if you couldn&#8217;t
handle the challenges in the final areas, so I didn&#8217;t use it. Now
that I&#8217;ve beat the game, I also see that the escape route is a way
to go back and do all the side excursions you didn&#8217;t do when you
beat the game. (There are 64 side missions. When I beat the game,
I had beat about 30 of them.)</p>

<h1>Story</h1>

<p>I really enjoyed the story of the game. I&#8217;d rate it about on
par with Final Fantasy VI, which as you may remember is my
previous favourite. The game does a very good job giving you
tidbits and making you feel like a part of the world from the
beginning. It gives the many twists in sensible places and it
isn&#8217;t too absurd. I think it is a bit similar to how in the
beginning of FF6, Kefka is clearly a bad guy, but it&#8217;s not obvious
he&#8217;s /the/ bad guy.</p>

<p>The structure of the game really works to make the story more
compelling. The linearity in the beginning forces you to get
engrossed in the characters and world, rather than in the
mechanics. The space in the middle where there is a lot of freedom
works well with the story because the characters are mostly lost
and not sure what to do, which you reflect in your wandering
exploration. When you finally find out how to get back on to the
main line story, the train starts rolling and brings you to the
destination. Rather than a hundred hours of chocobo races while a
meteor is falling to destroy the planet, you have a focused strike
to the heart of the enemy. Not once did the linearity bother
me.</p>

<p>The game does this thing where rather than a big cut scene,
there will be a medium one, then you walk for a little, fight a
few battles, then you get a short cut scene, then you repeat. This
is great because you never get bored or feel like you&#8217;re watching
a movie. However, there was a single time that it bothered
me. Without going into spoiling detail, there is one group working
together and then they split up into a few different groups, with
a totally new character accompany one person. The new character
has never met this person before and because the cut scene before
this was already long there is no conversation between them
introducing each other. You just start controlling this new
pair. After a few fights, however, they have the aforedesired
conversation. That was the one time I really wish I could turn
around, press a button, and have them talk to each other like in a
Western RPG.</p>

<h1>Music</h1>

<p>The music is beautiful. I got the soundtrack and listen to it a
lot. I really like the way the &#8220;Theme&#8221; is incorporated into so
many songs. My favourite is the music at the &#8220;Sunleth
Waterscape&#8221;.</p>

<h1><em>REDACTED</em>acters</h1>

<p>When I started playing I assumed that the game would be &#8220;about&#8221;
Lightning, in the same way FF7 is about Cloud or FF6 is about
Terra. Even though I felt that way the entire game, I realize in
retrospect that was really my choice as a player to keep her in my
battle time all the time and think about the events of the story
from her perspective. In actuality, every character really has
equal screen time and importance in the story. If anyone were
short changed, I think it would Sazh who is a non-entity during
the second half of the game and Fang/Vanille who don&#8217;t really open
up until a third through.</p>

<p>my wife asked me which character I felt like I identified with
most. I&#8217;m not sure there was one that was the most, but there was
something in each I can connect with. Lightning is driven by duty,
responsibility, and determination. Snow is driven by love and
bravery. Sazh is driven by his family. Fang is driven by the need
to protect and serve her family. Hope is at first driven by
revenge and then he becomes the symbol of hope and
rebirth. Vanille is the bright spot in the dreary world, trying to
cheer everyone up.</p>

<p>My favourite characters are the girls: Lightning, Vanille, and
Fang.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>Roleplaying games are cleanly separated into the story and the
gameplay. In many games there are multiple levels of gameplay.</p>

<p>For example, in many games there is the battle system, the
resource management system, the progression system, and the
exploration system. The battle system is the core and everything
else revolves around it. If you play the resource management game
poorly, then you can&#8217;t recover from battles or afford the needed
equipment to deal with larger threats. If you play the progression
game poorly, then you are not able to deal with the many
situations you&#8217;ll be put into, because you&#8217;ve focused poorly. If
you play the exploration system poorly, then you won&#8217;t find the
resources you need or you&#8217;ll die by a thousand paper cuts by
exploring too deeply without the needed resources. If you play the
battle system too cavalierly, by using too many powerful spells
you&#8217;ll hurt your resource management game even though you&#8217;ll beat
any battle. Conversely, if you don&#8217;t use your resources
effectively, you won&#8217;t be effective in the battle system.</p>

<p>The subtler aspects of the gameplay (resource management and
progression) are often missed by casual observers you see games as
flipping through menus. The exploration gameplay (which is often
implemented through random battles&#8212;they punish exploration) is
often frustrating when you can&#8217;t see it as a game of risk vs
reward. And the actual battle is often seen as flipping through
different menus, but a little bit faster.</p>

<p>A big problem with many games is that these systems don&#8217;t
interact in a way that is optimally fun or in a way that balances
fun across time. For example, you are going to spent most of your
gameplay time in battles. However, in most games the average
battle can&#8217;t be too hard because that would make the resource
management too hard. In almost all RPGs, you&#8217;ll find yourself in
some area and the challenge is to get the end of that area with as
much magic points as possible, so you that you can be fully healed
and charged for an actually hard battle with a boss. Each battle
along the way is trying to get you to spend too much magic (or
items, etc) to get through it, so that you will have depleted that
resource by the time you get to the boss. For that reason, almost
no random battle is actually ever hard in a RPG. If you want to
win, you can pull out everything and get through it. But, if you
did that, you&#8217;d ruin your chances of beating the boss. This is why
when you play most games you spend 90% of the time pressing
&#8220;Attack&#8221; rather than using magic. This is boring because you
aren&#8217;t making decisions. It&#8217;s not exciting because you&#8217;re not
getting to see the cool visuals of the spells, summons, etc. It&#8217;s
not exciting because you&#8217;re never really in danger.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 13 does not have this problem.</p>

<p>The biggest departure from the genre FF13 makes, in my opinion,
is not having a tightly linear story. It is removing the resource
management game.</p>

<p>In FF13, you are fully healed after every single battle and
there is no MP inside or outside of battle. If you take battles
one at a time, you can throw everything you have at them and know
that you&#8217;ll be able to through the same stuff out next time. This
gives the designers the freedom to make every battle hard. It
gives the player the freedom to make the battles exciting by using
everything at their disposal. This is also why when you die you
can start immediately in front of the enemy that killed you. Your
death couldn&#8217;t possibly have anything to do with things you did
before. That makes deaths more of a teaching experience.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not totally true. There are resources in the
game. The battle resources are Technical Points, healing items,
and shrouds. The upgrading system (part of the progression system)
uses resources called components. However, the battle resources
are almost entirely unimportant. Technical Points allow you to use
your summons and special powers. You only have 5 and you get about
1 after every battle (if you do well.) It is not hard to manage
them and I basically treated them like MP in other games: reserved
for really hard fights. The healing items are basically worthless
once you can have a Medic in your party all the time and once you
learn the Raise spell. In fact, I never used them after that. They
seem to be there so that you can heal in the beginning of the
game. Thus, managing them is never really an issue. Shrouds give
you little buffs before a battle and I never used them, not
once. They did seem pretty scarce, but it never affected me.</p>

<p>Since there is basically no resource management relative to the
battle system, the battle system is fundamentally different than
all games before it. Every single battle requires strategic
thinking to defeat, not just the bosses. There were many times
when I would die from fighting a normal enemy, think about what I
did wrong, try something different, die again, then try a third
thing, and get through. That is soooo satisfying. It is satisfying
on a &#8220;shmup&#8221;-like level. As mentioned before, in a normal RPG
dying almost certainly means you are idiot. If you die in a random
battle, you were too stupid to pull out all the stops. If you die
in a boss battle, you were too flagrant with your use of abilities
in the earlier battles or you didn&#8217;t figure out what the
vulnerabilities of the boss were. In FF13, a death is a great
learning experience that makes you appreciate the game more.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the battle system, which is a
little orthogonal to lack of resource management, is that you
actually need to employ all the features of the battle system to
be successful. (It is, of course, related to the lack of resources
because you are now free to utilize everything as well.) For
example, many games have status effects which you can give to
enemies (debuffs), however they almost never work on bosses, and
since they cost MP, you never use them. Similarly, many games have
status effects which you can give yourself (buffs), however their
effects are generally so small that it is only worthwhile to use
on bosses, but even then you&#8217;ve taken MP away from your damage or
healing potential, so you probably won&#8217;t use them. In FF13, you
need to use your buffs and debuffs a lot. Similarly, many games
have tried to use defending classes to draw enemy blows,
etc. (Cyan from FF6 and Auron from FF10 are examples of this.)
There&#8217;s almost no use for this though because bosses don&#8217;t fall
for it and normal battles can be won by all-out attacks. Again,
FF13 really requires the Sentinel class. I could go, but I think
you get the point.</p>

<p>In a bit more visceral of a way, the battle system is
exciting. Even though you wait for the ATB gauge to charge before
unleashing attacks, I felt compelled to slam out commands as fast
as possible. I had to dart my eyes around and take in my party&#8217;s
health, the enemy&#8217;s stagger bar, the enemy attacks that were
charging, etc. It&#8217;s really fun.</p>

<p>The fundamental strategy of the battle system is very versatile
too. Basically in every battle you are trying to get an enemy&#8217;s
stagger bar to 100% then unleash powerful attacks on to destroy
it. Most attacks are relatively ineffective if an enemy isn&#8217;t
staggered, so you have to do it. But, to stagger you need to focus
more on attacking than on defending or healing. Thus, you open
yourself up to attacks, so you have to drop back in a defensive
posture. But, if you wait too long, then your stagger progress
will be lost, so you have to switch back. Thus, the central
strategy compels you into a style of play where you are constantly
on the edge of winning or losing. This makes the game really
fun.</p>

<p>This change to the structure of the gameplay wasn&#8217;t perfectly
integrated though. In particular, the exploration game is mostly
gone. Since each battle is a fresh start for your characters,
there is no punishment for exploring too far or taking the time to
look down a hallway for another treasure sphere. As a result, the
placement of treasure is almost totally predictable and when
you&#8217;re wrong there&#8217;s no big deal. It&#8217;s clear they tried to
recreate this by having almost every treasure &#8220;guarded&#8221; by a
particular enemy. Yet, it doesn&#8217;t work the same. However, the
exploration game was always much smaller in RPGs than roguelikes,
so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>

<p>The final system, the progression system, of FF13 is great
too. There&#8217;s two parts to it. The character progression
(Crystarium) and the equipment progression (upgrading). The
Crystarium is a mostly linear path through the skills and
abilities of your roles. It does a few things really well
however. First, all characters get Crystarium points, whether they
are in battle or not. This is a major frustration in other games
where you are suddenly forced to use different characters and you
have to grind to get them to the level they need to be for the
part of the game you&#8217;re at. Second, it is really incremental. You
can get a new perk after only one or two battles. Third, even
though the path is mostly linear, you have to make a few important
decisions. Do you go for the new abilities that lie slightly off
the path and cost more? Or, do you go for the role bonus,
accessory, or ATB charge? Do you cherry pick from the various
roles trying to max one particular ability? (For example,
Vanille&#8217;s strength isn&#8217;t really a factor for the roles I put her
in, so it makes more sense to get her magic from other roles.) Do
you branch out of your primary roles? Etc. There are enough
decisions to make it fun, not enough to make it overwhelming, and
you can&#8217;t really lock yourself into a stupid configuration like
you can in other games.</p>

<p>The equipment upgrading game is /the/ place where resource
management matters. Equipment requires components to
upgrade. Organic components make synthetic components more
effective. Synthetic components do the major upgrading. Both can
be dropped from monsters or bought with gil that is dropped or
received for selling other drops, but the game is very stingy
about drops and gil in general, so you feel perpetually in need of
more stuff. There&#8217;s not much more to say about it other than it&#8217;s
not so easy it&#8217;s boring and it&#8217;s not so hard it&#8217;s
frustrating. (However, I haven&#8217;t fully upgraded anything and I&#8217;m
not looking forward to raising the 2.2 million gil to buy the
component I need to do it.)</p>

<h1>User Interface</h1>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have any major problems with the game in any aspect of
it. However, I definitely had nitpicks that are almost totally
about the user interface.</p>

<p><em>Battles.</em> I would&#8217;ve like more button binding when switching
paradigms. As it is, you have six or so in a list. You press L1 to
select one. I&#8217;d like to be able to press L1, then press a face
button to jump to a particular determined paradigm. That way I
could have Triangle be my preferred defending paradigm, Square be
my staggering, and X be my staggered, etc. I would have also liked
the ability to setup ability chains to enter simultaneously,
rather than slowly selecting them one by one.</p>

<p><em>Crystarium.</em> I would&#8217;ve like to see to how many Crystarium points
each character had at the end of each battle. I spent too much
time opening up the menu to check if there was anything I could
get. Even better would&#8217;ve been the ability to pick a target power
and have all my points automatically go towards that power after
each battle.</p>

<p><em>Paradigms.</em> Every time you change your battle party all your
paradigms setups are lost. Arggh! They should at least be remember
per party. Even better would be the ability to name and save sets
of configurations for different situations. I would&#8217;ve like the
ability to press L1 from the map and change my default paradigm
before a battle, rather than having to go through the main menu.</p>

<p><em>Equipment.</em> I would&#8217;ve like the ability to name sets of
equipment. I would&#8217;ve like to be able to use the &#8220;Optimize&#8221; option
on a single slot or perhaps fix a particular slot. (Specifically,
I like to use Optimize, but don&#8217;t want it to remove my Item
Collector equipment.)</p>

<p><em>Exploration.</em> Gran Pulse really needs a single map. I had a hard
time remember which teleporting location was which by just their
names. Similarly, I should be able to look at a different area&#8217;s
map rather than having to be in the area.</p>

<p><em>Missions.</em> As it is, a C&#8217;ieth stone that you can take a mission
from is blue-y, if you&#8217;ve never completed the mission is pulses. I
think they should&#8217;ve been a different color for missions you
haven&#8217;t got yet. That would&#8217;ve been much more convenient. I don&#8217;t
understand what value the gameplay gets from not being able to
have multiple active missions at a time. There were times when I
was on a mission, passed another mission pickup spot, passed that
same mission&#8217;s end point, then got to the mark of the mission I
was on, completed it, then had to backtrack twice: once to get the
new mission then once to get to its mark. That&#8217;s really
annoying. I don&#8217;t think it would make the game much easier to do
it differently.</p>

<h1>Replay</h1>

<p>If this game had a New Game+, I would play it again instantly to
get the story again.</p>

<p>I plan on continuing to play to finish all the missions,
although I don&#8217;t consider this &#8220;Replaying&#8221; the game. I&#8217;m playing
that content for the first time and I&#8217;m continuing my enjoyment of
the gameplay systems.</p>

<p>I can imagine playing through the main game again relatively
soon (say a year or eighteen months), but I can&#8217;t imagine going
through all the missions, etc in the same time period. I imagine I
will treat this game like FF6 or FF7. I&#8217;ve beaten all the Weapons
and gotten everything in FF7 once, but I&#8217;ve played and beat the
game four or five times. I&#8217;ve played through FF6 five or six
times, and gotten everything twice.</p>
