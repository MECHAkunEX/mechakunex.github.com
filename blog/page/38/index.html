  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played The Legend of Zelda on my AV Famicom with a RetroZone
PowerPak. It was awesome.</p>

<p>I started on Monday and played for about an hour while the <em>REDACTED</em>
was asleep. I got to the 2nd Dungeon, but got my butt kicked
pretty bad. I played yesterday and spent a lot of time in the
beginning crawling the map buying everything and finding all the
heart containers I could, then I got up to the 6th Dungeon in a
few hours. Today, I took it the rest of the way. I found the 6th
Dungeon to be very hard. I was able to complete the last dungeon
with two visits: the first one got me all the items and got me
familiar with the layout, but when I got to Ganon, I died, because
I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try&#8212;I only
used one potion too.</p>

<p>I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn&#8217;t shoot arrows (they consume money.)</p>

<p>It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don&#8217;t remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad&#8217;s map.</p>

<p>I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult&#8212;much more so than modern Zelda games&#8212;but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn&#8217;t
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 4<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I&#8217;ve been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I&#8217;ve been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.</p>

<p>I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don&#8217;t like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it&#8217;s pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the depth I&#8217;d like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.</p>

<p>The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It&#8217;s simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there&#8217;s no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn&#8217;t play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn&#8217;t totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.</p>

<p>Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don&#8217;t
need it.</p>

<p>The most appropriate word for this game is &#8220;fantastic&#8221; in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.</p>

<p>The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you&#8217;ve
seen or thought of before and doesn&#8217;t really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels&#8217; tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you&#8217;re walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It&#8217;s
really quite amazing.</p>

<p>What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It&#8217;s very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.</p>

<p>The story is baffling. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it&#8217;s baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There&#8217;s something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.</p>

<p>When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don&#8217;t think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don&#8217;t feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a must player.</p>

<p>Best Reader: YOU</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/">JC Fletcher&#8217;s review</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet.&#8221; and &#8220;If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing &#8230; your dream has been
fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played inFAMOUS last night. I&#8217;m glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the &#8220;So, sorry, Sony&#8221; program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.</p>

<p>At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.</p>

<p>The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.</p>

<p>I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.</p>

<p>Ba-leted!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This sounded like a really cool game: a combination of a shooter
and an adventure game where you travel through connected stages,
etc. Unfortunately, I found it impossible to understand what I was
supposed to do. I intend to give it another chance, maybe after
reading a manual, but I couldn&#8217;t cope with it when I tried it the
first time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played LittleBigPlanet last night too, which I got as part of
the same promotion as inFAMOUS. I had played the demo before.</p>

<p>This game is amazingly adorable. The team introduction in the
first level is adorable too.</p>

<p>This could have been a really charming and enjoyable game,
but&#8230;.</p>

<p>Wow, bad controls. So bad, I&#8217;m not actually interested in playing
it anymore. Really disappointing.</p>

<p>Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Raiden IV a bit. I played through to the end of the game,
including the second loop. I basically credit-fed the second loop
after making it to the second loop in a legit way. My best score
was 17,036,000. (A little short of the 20mil to get the last point
achievement.)</p>

<p>One thing I really liked about the game is that there were
massive, beautiful explosions and the way the ground spins, moves,
and feels really deep. I also liked the way the final boss appears
to be The Stone-Like. The weapon selection is pretty cool. It
reminds me a lot of Blazing Lazers.</p>

<p>There were quite a few things I didn&#8217;t like, though.</p>

<p>The size of the hit-box is really unclear and seems large.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel like the enemy bullets pop out of the background and
your bullets enough.</p>

<p>The game feels like it is cheating when you try to dodge some
shots. Specifically there are many times where the field is bigger
than the screen, so when you move to the left or right you move
across the background but basically stay in the same spot. This
feels like cheating because the bullets move with
you&#8212;effectively making it like you can&#8217;t dodge.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it when snipers come on-screen and then go to the
bottom of the screen and shoot up at you. I was thinking about
other shooters and couldn&#8217;t think of situations where you have to
dodge what is behind you&#8212;except in boss segments where the
screen is fixed and you&#8217;re not scrolling anymore. This last point
doesn&#8217;t seem broken; it is a legitimate gameplay choice, but I
don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t go in my rotation, but I got $10 worth of fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don&#8217;t think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.</p>

<p>As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn&#8217;t have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s competition, is, of course, Bayonetta&#8212;a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.</p>

<p>At it&#8217;s core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it&#8217;s very fair to compare them.</p>

<p>Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya&#8217;s commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn&#8217;t like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta&#8217;s dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.</p>

<p>In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.</p>

<p>There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a &#8220;strong&#8221; attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can&#8217;t, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.</p>

<p>One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it&#8217;s really not that bad because it&#8217;s so fast and you
basically can&#8217;t fail.)</p>

<p>Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.</p>

<p>On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it &#8220;as a
camera&#8221; rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don&#8217;t recall it ever happening.</p>

<p>But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn&#8217;t have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don&#8217;t remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was very curious about this game because I&#8217;m fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.</p>

<p>Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There&#8217;s no continuous spray of bullets and doesn&#8217;t even
seem to be a normal &#8220;fire&#8221; weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.</p>

<p>I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I&#8217;m too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.</p>
