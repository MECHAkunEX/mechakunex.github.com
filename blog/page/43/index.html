  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I&#8217;ve ever played.</p>

<p>I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.</p>

<p>I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn&#8217;t use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don&#8217;t want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don&#8217;t want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don&#8217;t regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.</p>

<p>There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.</p>

<p>Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips&#8230;)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:</p>

<p>/metaphor/</p>

<p>The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against &#8220;The Power of the Gods&#8221;; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?</p>

<p>Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
&#8220;only&#8221; lasts 29 minutes, I&#8217;ve played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.</p>

<p>Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.</p>

<p>By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.</p>

<p>I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn&#8217;t come with this game,
so I didn&#8217;t play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.</p>

<p>I beat this game. I didn&#8217;t get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn&#8217;t do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser&#8217;s Castle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through most of Super God Trooper Zeroigar, a shmup for
the PC-FX, tonight. It was pretty rad, but got a little bland
towards the end, which is why I stopped playing. I don&#8217;t
understand Japanese, so the long Anime cutscenes and conversations
didn&#8217;t have a big impact on me, but I appreciated their
presence. The shmuping was good, but the controls are way too
sensitive, which led to many stupid deaths.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played Bonk&#8217;s Adventure for the PC Engine (or
TurboGrafx-16.) The beginning of the game was very fun and
straight-forward, but once you get to the final level the
difficulty ramps up to an insane degree. It starts with a tunnel
in the water where there are spikes on the top and the bottom and
I have no idea how to get through without just spending multiple
lives to get through it. After that, there is a huge level full of
Mega Man-style disappearing blocks. Then there&#8217;s basically a boss
rush where you face all the previous bosses then two final bosses,
which are both insane. Nevertheless, the game was fun, but crazy
at the end. I got 66,080 points. Word.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I played through Metal Slug for the Neo-Geo. I didn&#8217;t
do very well: I got 508k points and used 28 continues. Ouch. It
was really fun though. The graphics in this game are /amazing/! I
have a hard time thinking of a modern game that is as
beautiful. The only real problem with the game is that shooting
diagonally is a big pain, but I probably just need practice. I
can&#8217;t wait to play it again or play sequels!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren&#8217;t that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn&#8217;t even in the game, but mentioned
and <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552">explained elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn&#8217;t resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something &#8220;stealthily&#8221; or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn&#8217;t make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn&#8217;t even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It&#8217;s not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the &#8220;real&#8221; way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin&#8217;s mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.</p>

<p>An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn&#8217;t fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren&#8217;t necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.</p>

<p>The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn&#8217;t angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would&#8217;ve liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!</p>

<p>Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don&#8217;t they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous &#8220;gamey&#8221; thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!</p>

<p>One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can&#8217;t follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don&#8217;t control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can&#8217;t have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in the simulation anyways,
so it&#8217;s already decided.&#8221; That&#8217;s true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
&#8220;ride&#8221;, but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.</p>

<p>I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.</p>

<p>Repetitive, boring slog.</p>
