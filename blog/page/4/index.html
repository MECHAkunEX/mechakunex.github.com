  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love this movie. It&#8217;s so inspirational and moving. I particularly
like the deep connection between it and the Gospel. I think it hits
the nail on the head in so many ways and is incredibly
pro-religion, of a sorts. I&#8217;ve read the book and I like both of
them for different reasons. It&#8217;s hard to say a lot about a movie I
just gush over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It&#8217;s strange
that everyone talks about York&#8217;s scar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie has a very unique and interesting premise: a dystopia
where vampires have become the norm and humans are rare. The
beginning of the movie, where you learn about what normal vampire
culture is like, is the best and most interesting part of the
movie. The rest of it lacks any unifying idea that brings it
weight. The cure is discovered to be controlled sunlight, but no
explanation is given why this would work. The cure turns out to be
contagious, so when a former vampire is fed from the feeder is
cured. There&#8217;s no explanation offered, although I would have liked
some pseudo-science. The rest of the movie is some pretty routine
chase and fight sequences. The movie feels very much like an
allegory about American imperialism and the ethic of kids who join
the military, combined with standard liberal concerns about oil,
etc. The other great missed opportunity is more guilt and attention
given to the main &#8220;bad guy&#8220;&#8216;s interaction with his daughter.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the movie was a disappointment. It wasn&#8217;t totally
terrible; I can definitely think of worse movies. But the majority
of what I got out of it, I would have had by just reading the
Wikipedia page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven&#8217;t
really been captured by it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The combat system
doesn&#8217;t seem as advanced as I&#8217;d like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I&#8217;ll keep playing, but I&#8217;m a bit sad I
haven&#8217;t been totally won over by it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the first two episodes of the 100% playthrough. I really
like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn&#8217;t yet done
what I did in the game, but he&#8217;s done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an amazing movie. The visual were out of this world. The
story is so inspiring. Although it is pretty bloody, for some
reason there&#8217;s really only like two gross parts. The grossest thing
was the disfigured people, but that&#8217;s weird, mainly because it&#8217;s
actually real.</p>

<p>Looking at the guys in the movie makes you feel tiny, puny, and
weak. It&#8217;s super intense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
&#8220;Inn&#8221; to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.</p>

<p>In a small way I&#8217;ve been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There&#8217;s just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.</p>

<p>I think doing one &#8220;episode&#8221; per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve played the first and third Star Ocean games and really
enjoyed them. I generally like everything that tri-Ace does, so
I&#8217;m looking forward to this game. I like the idea of the enhanced
PS3 version, but I don&#8217;t really know anything about the game or
about what is enhanced about this release.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour in my first session. The concept of the
world is pretty cool. It&#8217;s the first Star Ocean I can think of
that has Earth as a real place. I wonder if it is supposed to be
in the same continuity as the other games? The gameplay seems like
it will be cool. The battle system tutorial was incredibly
complicated and I did during the battle three times before
winning. That makes me hopeful, although a little bit of the time
I felt like I was losing because I couldn&#8217;t target the thing I
wanted. The graphics are pretty good, although the characters are
verrry anime-y and from some angles their clothes really clash
with their faces. (For example, the guy on the computer screen
that Edge talks to.) The controls are responsive.  Although the
camera controls are a little too &#8220;tight&#8221; for my taste so far. I
got a little stuck walking around in the space ship. I think the
problem is that the world is so &#8220;bright&#8221; that it&#8217;s hard to notice
something you can bump into. Anyways, the majority of the time was
spent in videos, so I don&#8217;t really have a good feel for the game
yet.</p>
