  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like Alien Crush, this game is a very exciting and interesting
pinball table. I feel like this game is a lot crazier because
after the initial ideas in Alien Crush, they were able to go all
out. There&#8217;s lots moving around on the course, there&#8217;s three
layers, and many complicated dependencies between
pieces. In that sense, it&#8217;s much better. Plus, they added a
pass-the-controller 2-player option, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ball physics feel much worse and the ball seems
totally outside of your control. I think part of it is that the
board is broken into three screens and each one is squatter (and
thus more detailed) than any screen was in Alien Crush. At the end
of the day, the game feels worse, despite looking much cooler.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I could imagine playing this game a lot&#8230; if not
for the interface friction.</p>

<p>When I played, my dad and I did the pass-the-controller for a
bit. My best score was 3.7 mil. I got this by getting the castle
on the bottom and then just being super cautious whenever I was
on the bottom screen. It worked like a charm!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the &#8220;living&#8221; board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it&#8217;s not too hard to get used
to.</p>

<p>I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there&#8217;s not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don&#8217;t really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &amp;
weren&#8217;t learning experiences.</p>

<p>I enjoy the game a lot, although I&#8217;m not sure how much I
like <em>this</em> game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I&#8217;ve played
this many many times with other people&#8230; like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I&#8217;ve never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you&#8217;re traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it&#8217;s really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I&#8217;ll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strong enough to last on its own&#8230; but then
again, it&#8217;s has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been about a month since I&#8217;ve played this game and I&#8217;m not
really interested in trying it again. It&#8217;s a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren&#8217;t compelling enough to last much longer than I&#8217;ve
played. It&#8217;s too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren&#8217;t gravity puzzles, as far as
I&#8217;ve seen.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn&#8217;t find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn&#8217;t effectively do the &#8220;hit yourself&#8221; trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn&#8217;t do that because I
didn&#8217;t have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I&#8217;m
curious about the story, but I&#8217;ll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today and gave it another chance. This time, it was a
total breeze. I did die in the Amazon after spending $300k, which
was really painful, but I realized that if you just hold bounce
next to the statue, guys come and die under you without a chance
of getting hurt. This was totally boring and stupid (it took
a few minutes), but it wasn&#8217;t horrific. After that, there was no
more grinding. The whole game was really short&#8230; just about an
hour from start to finish. The best part was the unique challenge
of not being able to directly jump on enemies and the way you
sometimes needed to whack things with your cane. (For example,
the mummy ducks in the mansion where fun to fight when you had to
whack their ball &amp; chain.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was fun&#8230; good music, cute monsters&#8230; and
it&#8217;s classic in a certain sense, but I don&#8217;t feel it is worth
replaying, because it is sooo easy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played again today and gave a bigger chance. I was able to
accomplish somethings, including killing one of the bosses. I
still think the core gameplay is really sloppy&#8212;the hit boxes
are bad, the shot control isn&#8217;t great, and the interface is
pretty whack. But, I can see why some people might have loved it
when it was released. I&#8217;m done with it though.</p>
