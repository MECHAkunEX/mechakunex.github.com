  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight. I got to the Old Cave and
to the Tower in the Northwest, but the enemies in the entry way
were pretty brutal. I feel like this game is almost all grind in
that way the DQ can be. There haven&#8217;t really been any cute
moments in the story since the main character and Lufia don&#8217;t
talk to each other anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I&#8217;m glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he&#8217;ll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half while we were watching a TV
show on my wife&#8217;s laptop. It was relaxing to grind a bit. I got
to the port town and met the guy who knew Guy. The story is very
simple so far, but it&#8217;s nice in a Dragon-Quest-y way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to beat this game today. I used a cheat code to give
infinite lines, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about continues and
replaying sections over and over (at least, until I got passed
them once, or in the case of the stage before a boss battle, more
times.) However, even with that, I was able to get to
Frankenstein&#8217;s in 3 lives. I took another three to get to stage
15 (the stage that ends in Death.) I did all that in about 30
minutes. I played the stage before Death for about 25 minutes
before church. Then I had a very NES moment and left the system
running while I was at church.</p>

<p>When I got back, I played Death&#8217;s sequence over and over again
for an hour and a half. Eventually I decided to focus on not
losing any life at all during the hallway with the two axe
knights and the brutal Medusa heads, by willingly sacrificing
lots of hearts. This turned out to be a good move and I gradually
improved. It took maybe three times of getting to Death with full
health before I defeated him. It was awesome.</p>

<p>It only took about 15 minutes to get to Dracula after that. It
took another hour and a half before I beat Dracula. It got to the
point where I could get passed the first form without taking any
damage pretty reliably, but then I had to work on my moves to
fight the second form. Eventually I decided to try the potion
rather than the cross, because the cross didn&#8217;t seem to do much
damage. This was an awesome move. The potion doesn&#8217;t do any
damage, but it stunlocks him so he can&#8217;t move. Provided I didn&#8217;t
have the double shot, I was able to lay into him for two hits,
then stun, then repeat. I was triumphant!</p>

<p>Altogether, I beat the game in about four hours. It felt so good
to do it. Even though I used a code, it was a pretty weak code
because I had to do everything. It&#8217;s a good example about what
I&#8217;d like games to do&#8212;be like spaced repetition systems (like
Anki), have me do a stage until I can beat it reliably, then move
on, but don&#8217;t show me something that is now easy (or moderate,
but with random swings all the time.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I gave this game a chance. Initially, the controls
felt so gross, but now I really love their unique stickiness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn&#8217;t notice anything wrong with Allison&#8217;s dancing. I&#8217;m
one of the &#8220;80% who don&#8217;t know anything about ballet&#8221;. It&#8217;s kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it&#8217;s all beautiful and can&#8217;t notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family&#8230; she
don&#8217;t seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>

for Allison. She seems really great, but in a lot of pain and
Rex isn&#8217;t being the best for her.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool &#8220;abilitease&#8221;. I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I&#8217;ve
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn&#8217;t realize it. But
now, it&#8217;s quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It&#8217;s cute so far though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn&#8217;t
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn&#8217;t (Craig&#8217;s conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts&#8217; character was very cute,
although we don&#8217;t learn anything about her, other than that she&#8217;s
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don&#8217;t really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

I&#8217;d heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very

to be used to so badly your whole life&#8230;</p>
