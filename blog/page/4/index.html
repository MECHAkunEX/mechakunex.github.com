  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I played for about an hour. I was surprised at how
quickly the new Jirall plot line was resolved. I was also very
sad that Calista was kidnapped. The game does a really good job
of making you feel really connected to and protective of
her. During the Jirall fight, I realized that I hadn&#8217;t seen
Dagran in a long time&#8230; where is he?</p>

<p>After we got home from the day, I played again, all night (about
four hours, with some breaks for snacks, etc.) I basically beat
the game and got to the epilogue. The final sequences had some
really tough fights. I fought the final boss three times before
winning. The final reveal of the big bad was pretty intense. I
really liked the epilogue sequence with Calista&#8217;s parents. It
seemed so appropriate for the couple to go on a little adventure
together before getting married. It&#8217;s adorable. Calista&#8217;s dress
was great too. I wish you could have her wear it during normal
gameplay. I feel like there&#8217;s still a lot of stuff to do in the
game&#8230; people to talk to, weapons to continue upgrading,
etc. It&#8217;s very strange. It&#8217;s like the final sequence of Earthbound
or Dragon Warrior but amped to the max because there&#8217;s so much to
do. It&#8217;s exciting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took my son to the theatre to see this today. He really enjoyed
it. I thought there were definitely some funny parts too, although
overall the plot is incredibly weak. It&#8217;s very short and a kid&#8217;s
movie, so that&#8217;s understandable. In terms of plot, it&#8217;s basically
the same as an episode of a cartoon, but with longer scenes and big
events. I thought the finale of the Scrat subplot was awesome
though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I advanced the story quite a bit. I feel like I&#8217;m in the closing
stages: I&#8217;m going to fight Zangurak, then send the Outsider back,
and live happily ever after with Calista. I thought her wedding
dress was very cute and I liked the resolution of the wedding
plot. In the game play, there&#8217;s been a bit of a boss rush of sorts
where boss encounters similar to ones from earlier in the game
keep coming back. It&#8217;s fun though. The fight next to the Outside
was pretty exciting and difficult. That whole sequence going down
the tunnel was very difficult&#8212;I think I died three times.</p>

<p>I accidentally used the Auto-Equip feature and all my outfits
changed. It was very painful to go back to dressing all the girls
how I like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my son wanted to play this real bad rather than Mega Man X
(which we&#8217;ve been playing for a while.) So we did it. We played
through the whole game. I got stuck pretty bad on the Wily
Machine, but other than that I walked through the game pretty
easily. I happened to choose a really nice order for the levels
so I had a lot of good items and weapons during the levels. It
was really fun to go through the whole game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a short amount of time yesterday before going to
bed. I mainly just advanced the story. It turns out that Lavos is
behind Zael&#8217;s power and the destruction of the world. Bummer. I&#8217;m
excited about a cute wedding scene.</p>

<p>TODO Go back to the mysterious island and go behind the entrance
where the Lvl 40 Cave Cougars are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played for a lot. A new arena season was opened, so I
had a lot of fun playing it over and over so I could max out all
my currently available items, etc. I did it like seven times. In
addition to that, I did some story missions, including the
haunted mansion. The best part of that was Horace&#8217;s ridiculous
comment about his wife afterwards. The stealth section escaping
from the castle was kind of odd, but worked as much as it needed
to. It was much better with Callista than with Zael alone. I&#8217;m
weirded out by Dagran being a sketch ball. I wonder where the
story is going. I presume that the Count is really the big bad in
some way, but maybe also I&#8217;ll fight &#8220;The Outsider&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When we got this from Netflix, my wife said &#8220;Ugh, Evangelion?&#8221; But
I think she enjoyed it. She commented on how the music was really
good and we were both impressed by the obviously better graphics
and effects. It is amazing how much is the same between this and
the originals though. I think it is already clearer what the
greater story is. I think there are more risque shots than before,
but, even so, they are quite tame. Not much to say other than that
I like Evangelion and this was preferred to watching the original
episodes. (Although I do miss the theme song.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a lot today as I rested from being sick. There some
pretty memorable moments: I loved the joke about why one family
had been in charge of guarding the forbidden gate for so long. I
was a bit disappointed that I wasn&#8217;t able to say &#8220;No&#8221; to the
Count or console Callista&#8230; the romantic comedy structure is
really being forced on me. I find the establishment of Mirania as
this character with a weird &#8220;food&#8221; quirk to be pretty
hilarious. I&#8217;m still really enjoying this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I showed this game to my son and got to block 3-2 on one
continue. I died once on Medusa, because I had been sloppy
earlier in the level and then the rest of the deaths came from
bad platforming (mostly swinging) in the last level. My son was
getting annoyed and kept asking me to kill myself so we could do
something else. Nice :)</p>
