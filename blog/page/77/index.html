  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.</p>

<p>This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn&#8217;t get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn&#8217;t get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
<a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=46&amp;gi=6946&amp;vi=7899">2,122,630</a>, but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)</p>

<p>I used lots of save states and I don&#8217;t think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn&#8217;t get to level 10.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wifey and I just beat World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck for the Genesis. This is a two player platformer
released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. It is really fun that you
have to cooperate with another person: sometimes you need to stand
on each other&#8217;s shoulders, pull the other player through a small
hole, or use a handcar together. There is also friendly fire in
the game, which is definitely exciting and forces you to really
communicate.</p>

<p>We played through all but the final level in one go a few weeks
ago, but we lost all our tries right near the end and waited until
tonight to finish it. We got back through all those parts and to
the final boss, but he creamed us up front. The problem was that
we didn&#8217;t know where to attack him. This is typical of this game:
it does a very poor job communicating to you what you need to do
to advance. For example, there are these doors in the final area
that are very hard to open because you don&#8217;t know what button to
press. Simple, but annoying.</p>

<p>Overall, the game is a nice quick platforming experience and I
think my wife liked it; and that&#8217;s saying something! I can&#8217;t wait to
play through the new Super Mario Brothers for the Wii with her.</p>

<p>We used Save States in the final area to conserve lives, but beat
the final boss on one try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she&#8217;s been waiting a long time for me.</p>

<p>I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the
second quest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Akumaj≈ç Dracula X Chi no Rondo on the PC
Engine CD.</p>

<p>This game is /amazing/. The levels are all so unique and
interesting. They are all challenging and the boss are
particularly frustrating, but totally satisfying and fun. I loved
being able to play as Maria after I rescued her. I can&#8217;t wait to
play Symphony of the Night again and pay attention to the
interactions with Maria. The game is definitely easier with her. I
only played with her through the alternate route and I beat
Dracula with both Richter and Maria. Naturally I also got 100%,
but I&#8217;d like to play it again sometime and go with Maria through
the primary route and Richter through the alternate route.</p></p>

<p>Update: One more thing. If you&#8217;ve played a Castlevania game,
you know how when you beat a boss, this magic sphere appears that
refills your health or advances you to the next level. I
/always/ jump to get it. It is so much fun!</p>

<p>I /absolutely/ recommend this game!</p>

<p>Finished with these paths:
Richter:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> Final
Prisoners: 2, 7</p>

<p>Maria:
1 -> 2&#8217; -> 3&#8217; -> 4&#8217; -> 5&#8217; -> 6 + Final
Prisoners: 3&#8217;, 4&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The &#8220;vibe&#8221; system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn&#8217;t proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn&#8217;t about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn&#8217;t finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you&#8217;re in for some frustration and annoyance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my last trip, I played through this game. I thought the
environment was really fresh relative to the last few Castlevania
games I&#8217;ve played and I enjoyed the partner system a lot, although
I felt like I didn&#8217;t have as much use for <em>REDACTED</em>lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I&#8217;m really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don&#8217;t think I will for a while.</p>

<p>My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn&#8217;t beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn&#8217;t finish the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was growing up, I really liked fighting games like /Street
Fighter/, but I was horrible at them, whether I played the
computer or another person. I decided earlier this year that I
would learn how to be good, so I bought Street Fighter IV and I
practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz
Street Fighter 4 FightStick Tournament Edition Arcade
stick. Heaven! It is so sweet to use for this game and some many
others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!</p>
