  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through The Legend of Zelda: The
Minish Cap. I knew I was almost done, so I stayed up a little too
late finish it tonight.</p>

<p>The graphics in this game are beautiful and vibrant. Many games
these days are dark and muddy, so it is refreshing to have such a
bright game. The game has the same style as /Link to the Past/,
but with a bit more cudly-ness.</p>

<p>The sound is good. I caught my wife humming a few of the
tunes.</p>

<p>The story is a respectable Zelda story. I like that the title
is a double entendre.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very good. It has the same core mechanics as
the first Zelda and /Link to the Past/ (my two
favourite), but almost all the items are brand new. The Kinstone
system (wherein you collect trinkets and give them to particular
NPCs) is a nice abstraction of a quest mechanic, although I
would&#8217;ve liked to have been able to get to the bonuses without
using a Kinstone, somehow. The boss fights are very fun and
difficult enough&#8212;I had to repeat two of them and the final
boss&#8217;s first form got me the first time. The dungeon designs are
good. The puzzles are interesting without being infuriating. I
only had a few times where I wanted to throw the control (all in
the Wind Palace, btw.) The world is big enough to make it
interesting and the teleport system is convenient.</p>

<p>I finished the game with 14 heart containers, two bottles,
without the boomerang, with the original shield, without any bomb
bag/quiver upgrades (actually I&#8217;m not sure if there are any) and
with all the sword techniques. It was a little hard to complete
with such a small amount of life and only two bottles, but it was
obviously do-able and fun.</p>

<p>I definitely still prefer /Link to the Past/, but
this is worth playing again and thus worth playing for the first
time too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I bought Ikaruga back in August, I&#8217;ve <em>still</em> been playing
every day. I&#8217;ve played for 38 hours, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds
according to the game clock. I&#8217;ve recently made a nice
achievement, so I thought I would make a progress report.</p>

<p>My accomplishments to date:
- <em>Credit-feeding through the game on Easy, Normal, and Hard.</em>
This was the first thing I did by October. (It&#8217;s not totally
brain-dead because you have to beat the bosses within the time
limit.) I was able to get through Easy before unlocking
free-play.
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 1.</em> I did this by the end of
November. It was really hard to get to that point, but now I get
an A without even thinking about it.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 1 - Dot Eater.</em> This only took a few tries and
was relatively easy. Done in November.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 2 - Dot Eater.</em> This was very hard, because it
requires pixel-perfect control to get through the blocks at the
beginning of the level. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIDc04e79M">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a> But it
only took about two months, maybe a little less. Done in
December.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 3 - Dot Eater.</em> This was /very hard/. I&#8217;ve been
working on this since December, but I just did it tonight. For
comparison, there are over a thousand people who&#8217;ve done Chapter
1 - Dot Eater, 103 who&#8217;ve done Chapter 2, and only 44 who&#8217;ve
done Chapter 3. (FWIW, 24 for Chapter 4 and 25 for the Final
Chapter.) There are four main challenges to this: first, getting
through the moving block lasers that push you into obstacles,
then getting through rows of enemies and moving spears, then
getting chased by/dealing with Shigi, then dealing with the
spinning boss Uzura. Yikes. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5iefdDhvs">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a>
- <em>Easy and Normal - One credit to Chapter 3&#8217;s Boss.</em> Not much to
say here, except that doing these levels Dot Eater helps train
for the normal mode well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Tomba! over the past few weeks as my
&#8220;main&#8221; game.</p>

<p>This game defies categorization.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s primarily a platforming game with a few accoutrements to
that basic experience: you get a number of different weapons, some
speed bonuses in form of new pants, and some utility items like a
grappling hook and a parasol (so you fall slower.) While the world
and gameplay in primarily 2D, you often need to jump into the
&#8220;background&#8221; and onto a different plane. Sometimes when you go
into the background the camera rotates to a different slice of a
3D area you&#8217;re exploring. It&#8217;s very neat mechanically.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the game is the mission system. As you
interact with the world and individuals in it, they inform you of
a problem. If and when you solve it, you gain AP and unlock
potentially more missions. Some of them are required, but
definitely not all of them. There are 130 in the game; I found 106
and cleared 87 of them. (I ended with 755,900 AP. I reckon this
isn&#8217;t very much.)</p>

<p>Overall the game is very fun and unique. I imagine that Zelda II:
The Adventure of Link could have been like this game and moved the
Zelda series in a good direction rather the dead-end /Zelda II/
was. /Tomba!/ took me 4 hours and 27 minutes on the clock to beat,
but I would guess I probably spent closer to 2.5 times that amount
of time due to the difficulty of the platforming and bosses that
required reloading my save file.</p>

<p>I easily recommend it. Despite having typical PS1 loading time
problems, it&#8217;s definitely worth it. I&#8217;m excited to play the sequel
eventually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week or so, I&#8217;ve played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms&#8212;I played on the Mac.</p>

<p>It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven&#8217;t played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end&#8212;it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.</p>

<p>I got the game <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html">for free</a>, so it was totally worth it. It costs <a href="http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287">$20</a>
and I&#8217;d say it is worth closer to $15.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About two weeks ago, <em>REDACTED</em> and I wanted to do something together
but didn&#8217;t have a movie to watch, didn&#8217;t want to play New Super
Mario Brothers Wii, didn&#8217;t want to watch Seinfeld, and were feeling
lazy. So we decided to start watching a new Joss Whedon show,
Dollhouse. Naturally, we haven&#8217;t done much at night since then
except watch it. Last night we finished the second season and thus
the whole series.</p>

<p>This show is amazing and awesome. It&#8217;s very clever, in that Joss
way. The world is compelling and you feel like you understand it,
in that Joss way. The characters feel real, in that Joss way. There
is an epic story with twists and turns, in that Joss way. Everyone
needs to watch it. It helps suggests deep thoughts about free will,
love, desire, and technology that are fascinating and
important.</p>

<p>When I watched it, however, I realized one thing more than
anything else: /TV is Dead/.</p>

<p>I would /never/ watch live TV for any reason, other than General
Conference, even for a show as amazing as Dollhouse. If a show like
this can&#8217;t get me to watch TV, and since it was cancelled the
feeling is common, then good TV simply can&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>

<p>This is really sad, because easily my favourite creative person
in film/movies/etc is Joss Whedon and his forte is the arc and the
world that are only possible with TV serialization. That format
needs some other way of existing profitably. (DVD sales, etc can&#8217;t
do it because they assume it has already aired.) I don&#8217;t have any
ideas or advice, but I wish I did.</p>

<p>The looming cancellation of the show is incredibly present as
you watch it. It&#8217;s totally true that the second season feels like
it is on &#8220;fast forward&#8221;. There were many episodes where <em>REDACTED</em> and I
looked at each other and said, &#8220;That would be half a season if this
were Buffy&#8221;, or similar comments. Yet, I&#8217;m glad the show had so
much closure and moved so far, especially after the annoying
non-ending of Firefly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.</p>

<p>This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and &#8220;flip&#8221; on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the &#8220;hardest&#8221;
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here&#8217;s a video of someone else doing it:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&amp;feature=related">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my end-game stats:</p>

<p>Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19</p>

<p>Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189</p>

<p>Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it&#8217;s easy to play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that&#8217;s how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction &#8220;mysteries&#8221; are simply crazy
things you can&#8217;t possible know until they come out of left
field. I&#8217;m glad this game wasn&#8217;t like that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Kid Dracula for the Gameboy. It&#8217;s a very straight-forward
platformer with a shooting mechanic. It has a little bonus
mechanic of different kinds of magic that let Kid Dracula turn
into a bat, walk on the ceiling, use a protective umbrella,
etc. Most of these things are only useful in a few places in the
eight level game, but they are present enough to make it fun to
use them. The best part about the game, however, is the clever cut
parody of the Castlevania series. Most of the common enemies show
up in super-cute form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve played through Cave Story on the
PC. (It has recently been re-released in an updated form for
WiiWare.)</p>

<p>It has a very unique and fun mix of Mega Man, Metroid, and
Adventure-style game play. I played through the &#8220;Hard&#8221; version of
the game where you get Booster 2.0 and I played through the &#8220;Hell&#8221;
final area as well.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it. It is free to download and it&#8217;s very
fun. It inspires me to work more often on my game ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of the past two-ish months, I&#8217;ve played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It&#8217;s kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It&#8217;s quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don&#8217;t get as many
lives/bombs during it.)</p>

<p>I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn&#8217;t registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)</p>

<p>Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540</p>

<p>Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)
