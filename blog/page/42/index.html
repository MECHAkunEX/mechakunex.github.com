  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn&#8217;t come with this game,
so I didn&#8217;t play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.</p>

<p>I beat this game. I didn&#8217;t get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn&#8217;t do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser&#8217;s Castle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through most of Super God Trooper Zeroigar, a shmup for
the PC-FX, tonight. It was pretty rad, but got a little bland
towards the end, which is why I stopped playing. I don&#8217;t
understand Japanese, so the long Anime cutscenes and conversations
didn&#8217;t have a big impact on me, but I appreciated their
presence. The shmuping was good, but the controls are way too
sensitive, which led to many stupid deaths.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played Bonk&#8217;s Adventure for the PC Engine (or
TurboGrafx-16.) The beginning of the game was very fun and
straight-forward, but once you get to the final level the
difficulty ramps up to an insane degree. It starts with a tunnel
in the water where there are spikes on the top and the bottom and
I have no idea how to get through without just spending multiple
lives to get through it. After that, there is a huge level full of
Mega Man-style disappearing blocks. Then there&#8217;s basically a boss
rush where you face all the previous bosses then two final bosses,
which are both insane. Nevertheless, the game was fun, but crazy
at the end. I got 66,080 points. Word.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I played through Metal Slug for the Neo-Geo. I didn&#8217;t
do very well: I got 508k points and used 28 continues. Ouch. It
was really fun though. The graphics in this game are /amazing/! I
have a hard time thinking of a modern game that is as
beautiful. The only real problem with the game is that shooting
diagonally is a big pain, but I probably just need practice. I
can&#8217;t wait to play it again or play sequels!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren&#8217;t that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn&#8217;t even in the game, but mentioned
and <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552">explained elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn&#8217;t resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something &#8220;stealthily&#8221; or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn&#8217;t make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn&#8217;t even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It&#8217;s not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the &#8220;real&#8221; way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin&#8217;s mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.</p>

<p>An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn&#8217;t fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren&#8217;t necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.</p>

<p>The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn&#8217;t angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would&#8217;ve liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!</p>

<p>Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don&#8217;t they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous &#8220;gamey&#8221; thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!</p>

<p>One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can&#8217;t follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don&#8217;t control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can&#8217;t have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in the simulation anyways,
so it&#8217;s already decided.&#8221; That&#8217;s true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
&#8220;ride&#8221;, but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.</p>

<p>I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.</p>

<p>Repetitive, boring slog.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing this. Castlevania&#8230; how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:</p>

<p>The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She&#8217;s beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn&#8217;t fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she&#8217;s wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she&#8217;s absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.</p>

<p>The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated&#8230; I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.</p>

<p>The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits&#8230; some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That&#8217;s something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and &#8220;makes sense&#8221;. This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula&#8217;s Castle it is huge.</p>

<p>The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.</p>

<p>The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.</p>

<p>The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don&#8217;t
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game&#8217;s combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn&#8217;t really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops&#8212;like Arma Felix, so cool!)</p>

<p>I recommend this game, no reservations!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For almost the past two months, I have been playing Sin and
Punishment: Hoshi no Keishōsha every day. In the beginning, I
could only get through about 15 minutes of the game, so it fit
well into my rotation. As I got towards the end, I would play
every day, get to right before the final boss and die, losing
about 45 minutes of my life every time. But! I loved it so much!
It is so satisfying to play this game and slowly get better at
getting through each boss, each segment; learning how to get more
and more enemies and points. At times I feel like I&#8217;m playing a
beautiful piano piece that I&#8217;ve practiced for so long.</p>

<p>When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t know about the sword or that you
could knock back projectiles at enemies, so once I learned I
quickly got past some of my previous bottlenecks. My favourite
part of the game is when you control Airan: running through the
ship with her, fighting Leda, going on the chase, and destroying
the fleet is just so&#8230; EPIC! Then, the subway sequence is really
fun, but honestly, not as cool as the ship sequence. The first and
second parts with Saki are fine, but the side-scrolling final
stage is awesome. The difficulty in the game is perfect. Even
though I got through the final boss on my first try, it was insane
and frenetic. I ended with about 564 hit points left on the Earth,
which started around 30k, so I clearly didn&#8217;t do an amazing
job. But it was awesome.</p>

<p>The music is great for its era (although wifey reports that she
got pretty tired of it.) The visuals hold up very well actually,
because everything is so big. Ya, the textures in the backgrounds
are really blurry, but it actually gives an apocalyptic and fast
paced feel. The controls are really smooth&#8230; although I didn&#8217;t
play on a N64 controller. (I used the best controller ever aka
arcade stick. I mapped the top three buttons to: strafe left,
fire, strafe right, lock-on/manual. Then the bottom left button to
jump so that I just laid my hand down and never had to move it. I
feel like the game was easier this way because I used more digits
than the N64 controller would &#8220;fit.&#8221;) I love the pacing and the
simple (but interesting) scoring system.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for the sequel, Sin and Punishment: Sora no Kōkeisha
to come out. If it doesn&#8217;t make it over, I&#8217;ll definitely have to
import a Japanese Wii or something to play it. I heart it.</p>

<p>Now the final business: My score. I played on Easy for this first
play-through. (I will do Normal soon.) I got 44,214,705 points,
spent 46 minutes and 41 seconds and got 2033 enemies. This is all
on one credit, of course.</p>

<p>Love it!</p>
