  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought this episode was very neat. There were some cool
revelations: more people on Caprica and how many Cylons were
left, in particular. I&#8217;ve decided that I think Gaius&#8217; goal is to
create a truce between the Humans and the Cylons. I&#8217;ve been
really annoyed with Tigh&#8217;s behavior. Now I think things will get
back on track now that the Commander is back on his feet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think my two favourite parts about this episode were the events
involving the Chief and the President.</p>

<p>I thought the Chief acted very wisely in trying to help out the
two girls, but also that he was noble in his obedience to
&#8220;soldier ethics&#8221; in regards to the Doctor&#8217;s disagreement with the
Lt. I find the command structure of the military to be
fascinating&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to be involved in it, but it&#8217;s
great.</p>

<p>The President&#8217;s little speech and revelation was pretty epic and
tough.</p>

<p>The XO is such a punk. I wonder how Adama will clean up his mess
once he wakes up. Tension.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really awesome episode. I thought they did a great job
making it really tense. I thought it was also awesome how the XO
knew what the goal of the Cylons was&#8230; given his previous
experience in the last war. It is very cool to think about how
they&#8217;ve already fought them before and what it was like the last
time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As if the last episode/season finale did not end with enough bad
stuff going on, this one opens with almost every bad thing
imaginable all happening at the same time. Some of the bad things
seem a bit too contrived&#8230; like Starbuck losing the raider. But
overall it created a lot of tension that the rest of the season
can resolve.</p>

<p>I like the further development of the backstory for some of the
characters.</p>

<p>I was really struck by how the marine wanted to pray and he
called the president the Gods&#8217; prophet.</p>

<p>I was very annoyed that Lee didn&#8217;t immediately go investigate the
fallen Cylon ship, although maybe the next episode will open with
him doing exactly that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a super epic episode. Boomer and Starbuck were
incredibly brave to do their parts in the beginning. The
realizations on Caprica were fascinating too. And it ended with a
totally crazy situation. The main problem was that there was no
real resolution of anything, just more bad things going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a neat episode. I liked the way the expressed such awe
over finding Kobol. It would be like finding Atlantis but much
much more significant. I don&#8217;t really feel like the episode was
&#8220;Part 1&#8221; of anything though, because it wasn&#8217;t sufficiently
cliff-hangery to make me really need to watch the next part
directly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly&#8212;every two days&#8212;and I haven&#8217;t stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game&#8230; i.e. got to the ending sequence&#8230; on
September 30th, but I&#8217;ve been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b">Here&#8217;s a video commentary</a> of the whole
normal game.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant game. It&#8217;s amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren&#8217;t reflected in the replay. If that&#8217;s the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.</p>

<p>Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a &#8220;puzzle&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren&#8217;t logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It&#8217;s very neat and you don&#8217;t need to have it
explained that you are racing, it&#8217;s so obvious when you start.</p>

<p>The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+&#8230; a game I really loved&#8230; on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.</p>

<p>Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you&#8217;d done before.</p>

<p>I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It&#8217;s an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.</p>
