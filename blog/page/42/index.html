  <div class="entry-content"><p>I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell&#8230; a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Yie Ar Kung-Fu for my Famicom tonight. I got it when I
bought the Famicom and I read that it was one of the first
fighting games.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy&#8217;s skull and it doesn&#8217;t register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.</p>

<p>But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.</p>

<p>However, other than number 9, I&#8217;ve never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Eternal Sonata on the Xbox from October 17th to
last night. I remember downloading the PS3 demo when I was sick
one day when the <em>REDACTED</em> was very very young. It seemed pretty cool,
and I like Tri- games, so I&#8217;ve had on my list since then. I saw a
Craigslist posting about it and grabbed it for ten bucks. I
finished the game with 23:59:46 on the game clock and my A-team
was around level 53 (significantly lower than a FAQ I glanced at
recommended) and the other characters on the bench were around the
low 40s.</p>

<p>The story and setting of this game is really bizarre. It takes
place inside the mind of Chopin, the composer, on his death bed
and is about a group of people kinda fighting the big bad empire,
but at the end it takes an even more bizarre turn and loses all
comprehensibility. But it doesn&#8217;t really matter. The end was even
worse for me because I used Japanese language with English
subtitles during the game and the ending had no subtitles. (Really
weird actually.) I don&#8217;t regret it though because the few times I
heard the English voices was horrific.</p>

<p>The graphics are beautiful and cartoony. There are many tiny
details in the background which really give flair to the world. In
a word, the graphics are &#8220;lush&#8221;&#8230; in colour, in detail, in
scope&#8230; it&#8217;s great. However it is incredibly unrealistic, unlike
say FF13 which is fantastic in a realistic way. One thing strange
about the art is how the characters look mostly like action
figures, but then there is uncanny shading on a nose, or under
eyes, or on cleavage, or even on the edge of their hair. I think
the worst part of most characters is how &#8220;stuck on&#8221; their hair
looks. In particular, Allegretto looks like a bald man wearing a
wig.</p>

<p>When I started I assumed that the music would have been amazing,
but it was just good. Nothing really special about it, but
definitely serviceable and a solid &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now, let me comment on the mechanics.</p>

<p>It has a really weak meta-game, outside the combat. There is very
little constraint on your resources. Well, if you rely on battles
to give you money, you&#8217;ll be struggling. However, Beat can take
pictures and sell even bad pictures for about 10k, where the best
weapons and items cost far less than even 3k. Since you can store
12 photos, this means that every time you visit a shop you can get
over 100k. This basically means you have infinite money. The real
constraint on your resources is that you always need to back-track
(the game is a straight line) to get to a shop, so you need to
make sure you stock up beforehand.</p>

<p>Other parts of the meta-game are a little annoying. For example,
you have an incredibly large party and balancing their levels
becomes very frustrating and I gave up around 15 hours in and just
stuck with one group. The exploration of dungeons can be very
annoying too. One of the prices of the lushness is that almost
every area of a big dungeon looks identical and every one is
either a literal maze or puzzle. These are fine in moderation, but
this game does it too much and rewards the exploration too
little. (There are very useful items in chests, for example.)</p>

<p>The largest part of the game is the battle system.</p>

<p>They do a good job unfolding the battle system with the Party
Level system that advances at fixed story parts and gives you new
challenges and options. In a nutshell, it works like this: each
character has their own turn that lasts a fixed amount of time,
they have some amount of Tactical Time before their clock ticks,
and movement/attacks take certain amounts of time. Time is
essentially your MP-like resource that controls what you
do. Special attacks are divided into dark and light categories
which you can only join when you are in light or dark
areas. Enemies are affect by the light too. It&#8217;s a neat little
thing. As your party level goes up, some of these get more
complicated. For example, at the beginning tactical time is
infinite and at the end it is zero. At the end, the speed of your
characters just goes up a lot so you can get things done faster. I
would said it is almost too fast at the end&#8230; I accidentally ran
past enemies a lot.</p>

<p>Overall, the battle system was satisfying, but it has a lot of
flaws. First, there are things that are too cumbersome to actually
use, like switching special attack sets in battle. I&#8217;m amazed they
didn&#8217;t bind that to the triggers. Second, the layout of the
characters, enemies, and arena are few in number in each area of
the game&#8230; on the order of two or three. This means once you
discover how to beat that enemy configuration, you can do the
exact same thing again. It gets old and makes you want to just run
past the enemies so you don&#8217;t have to fight them. Third, there is
a single strategy that works for all random encounters and one
that is almost the same that works for all bosses. For normal
enemies, just do lots of little combos and take them out one by
one. For bosses, build up Harmony Chains (big combos) with two
characters and have the other one on healing duty. This makes lots
of fights incredibly rote and frankly a little
boring. Nevertheless, each session of playing had a significant
section where I enjoyed the smashing of buttons and increasing of
numbers.</p>

<p>I actually fell asleep during this game more than once. One time I
was even in battle and fell asleep briefly, then woke up and
survived the battle with the one character that wasn&#8217;t dead yet. I
think in that case it says more about me than the game.</p>

<p>I thought about quitting the game a few times, but ultimately
decided to continue. I&#8217;d say it was worth it, but would have been
better if the game were shorter (or just better, of course.) I
doubt I will play this again. And so, I can&#8217;t recommend it very
highly, despite being a reasonable game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel like I know a little more the purpose of the plot on
Caprica. I greatly enjoyed the many references to the scriptures
of the humans. I thought the large insight on Baltar&#8217;s part about
his role and position was interesting. Overall, it was a cool
episode. It had exploration of the universe, some good drama,
some good action, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode. It was very comical. There was a
funny &#8220;make-out spot&#8221; sequence with Billy. I thought the
developing plot with Sharon (on Caprica) is very interesting. I
really disliked the character of Tigh&#8217;s wife&#8230; I hope that she
isn&#8217;t that obnoxious all the time.</p>

<p>By the way, I really hate that they show spoilers for the episode
in the intro, so I close me eyes. So weird that they would do
that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m beginning to really like Starbuck&#8217;s personality and I like
the interrogation of the Cylon, because they are very interesting
characters. This was the first time I realized that it is a bit
unreasonable to only show Cylons we know of working together
(when they are by themselves) simply as a conceit to the fact
that viewers shouldn&#8217;t know who the other ones are. The trope of
a &#8220;shadowy council&#8221; probably won&#8217;t be as bad as this. I think it
is very interesting to speculate on the psyche and goals of the
Cylons, particularly with their psychological warfare like shown
in this episode. I was very intrigued by what would happen when
Gaius found out that Sharon was a Cylon&#8230; will he tell Adama
right away?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great episode. My favourite characters are Gaius and
Number Six, so I was glad that the whole episode was about
them&#8212;with a little bit in the background maintaing the other
plot threads. I&#8217;m excited for him to actually make progress on
the Cylon detector (slash) doing the will of Number Six. I&#8217;m also
really excited about studying the Raider.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very court-room drama style episode. I was most
interested in speculating about Gaius and what&#8217;s going on
Caprica. The stuff on Galactica was fine, but not the kind of
thing I&#8217;m really into. I feel like the disobedience of tribunal
will be forgotten, but if it won&#8217;t be, then this will be a
pivotal moment.</p>

the nobility of the pilots in both fighting for their friend and
bowing to the moral pressure of the President. I thought it was
also amazing how Starbuck got the Cylon ship ready for flight and
marked it as well. I hope it will be really useful for them to
research the Cylons, both biologically and mechanically. I&#8217;m
excited about where this can go.</p>
