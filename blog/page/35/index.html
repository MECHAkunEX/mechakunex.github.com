  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am looking for more monsters&#8230; on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I&#8217;ll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy&#8212;I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I&#8217;m kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don&#8217;t want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I&#8217;ll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It&#8217;s weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn&#8217;t see any extra scene&#8230; will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits&#8230; that&#8217;s it&#8230; so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there&#8217;s no harder monsters to challenge, so it&#8217;s like it isn&#8217;t
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn&#8217;t acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We didn&#8217;t watch for as long as I hoped today&#8230; just one
episode. It was a really good episode though. I like the struggle
they are having about using support from the Cylons. I continue
to be fascinated by Gaius and what he is going to do. I love it
when he just says whatever Figment Six tells him to. I&#8217;m kind of
surprised what happened with Ellen. It seems even too low for
her. During this episode, I remembered something from the
Colonial Scriptures&#8230; it said that the 13th tribe was pursued by
demons. We were originally meant to assume that this was the
Cylons, but it appears that it was really not. I think it was
humans who later attacked them (as I said above.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had the worst experience playing this game ever. It lost my
progress from last time so I had to do a five level sequence over
again. It was unbearable. I noticed that this game has a much
worse UI than Meat Boy. For example, it is infuriating to have to
save every five levels and that it didn&#8217;t work and that you need
to press A to revive and that you can&#8217;t watch replays. Annoying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s plan is to try and kill the Long Gui and the Yomi. Killed
the Long Gui on the second try with 2 staggers and 5 stars. Beat
Yomi on the first try. See what I mean? Easy. In the &#8220;last time on
FF13-2&#8221;, it shows Lightning saying &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you to keep hope
alive&#8221;. It was &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you to keep Hope alive&#8221;, then it could
be a reference to Snow saying that he will be assassinated! Got
Supreme Being! Raspatil was really tough, but I got him on the
first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every
monster that isn&#8217;t on the Steppe!  [054:35:29 Frags 159/160 Lvl

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There&#8217;s a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool&#8212;especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the &#8220;real/good&#8221; ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. &#8220;The Future
is Hope&#8221; ending is strange because it seems like the &#8220;true&#8221;
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good&#8212;but it&#8217;s very anti-climatic&#8230; although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: &#8220;A new adventure was just beginning&#8212;the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!&#8221; Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough&#8230; it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn&#8217;t been any explanation given of why Snow is a l&#8217;Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower&#8211;The A.Z Files&#8212;reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
that can be done in the game still. [050:43:10 Frags 157/160 Lvl

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first time really playing in almost a week! The Chaos Crystal
weapons aren&#8217;t really powerful yet, I guess I don&#8217;t have enough
Fragments. I made my list of things to do in each location more
clear. The only location/time with a gate I haven&#8217;t gone to is the
Archelytte Steppe. I just got a Gigantaur crystal!!!  I love that
the hover jump is enough to get over a bridge-distance in the
steppe. Hey! I found Sazh! Sazh&#8217;s little speech sounds like he was
reading it and did it so fast. After that I saw Lightning, but it
was strange because she acted like she couldn&#8217;t hear us, but at
other points in the story see can see everything
everywhere. [045:33:27 Frags 120/160 Lvl 443]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode had a major plot dump. It was very interesting and
pretty consistent. I think my favourite part was how Helen
described how John set the Five up so that they would have &#8220;front
row seats&#8221; to his plans. It was also interesting to speculate on
the meaning of &#8220;this has all happened before&#8221;&#8212;particularly
given the implication that the 13th Tribe were Cylons and there
was a war on Kobol between AIs and Humans. They still haven&#8217;t
explained who destroyed Earth when the Cylons were living
there. I speculate that it was a group of humans from Kobol who
had been searching for the Cylons for revenge and didn&#8217;t go with
the 12 Colonies. I&#8217;m also fascinated by the idea that Galactica
is falling apart and will be improved by Cylons technology. And
I&#8217;m fascinated that Lee will reform the government. I can&#8217;t
believe that the show can keep getting better and going in
different directions.</p>
