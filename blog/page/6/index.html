  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for almost an hour tonight. It is brilliant in
its simple setup, but complex puzzles. The controls are
horrible&#8212;you can&#8217;t turn in mid-step, you can&#8217;t stop on stairs,
and you don&#8217;t always use a special attack when you think you
will. The graphics are horrific. The music is about 4 notes
repeated. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s a really addicting and satisfying
game. It&#8217;s neat that you can watch replays of your last
attempt. This game is very similar to Lolo-style games, but
different enough that it feels unique. I was very impressed.</p>

<p>On the Game Boy, apparently it has 80 levels, and I did 31. I
think I burnt myself out on it in the one sitting I did. I will
definitely play this again, and probably pick up where I was
before, but I&#8217;ll mark it as done because I think I understand the
game pretty thoroughly and (like the Crush games) I can&#8217;t really
binge on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for about an hour today. I used an emulator and
couldn&#8217;t resist save states. In the beginning, I worked my way
through on my own, using saves at each screen. I had no sense of
what the items would do, so I didn&#8217;t really buy any. After a
while, I looked at a walkthrough (which basically just recommended
which items to buy) and learned that I missed a few essential
hidden items. I restarted and made it to stage 4 following the
guide. I went away to eat, paused, and when I came back, the game
had reset itself.</p>

<p>This game looks and sounds really good, especially for its
age. It&#8217;s cute and has some interesting mechanics. I think of it
as a lot like Zelda 2, but with a less interesting combat system,
sloppier mechanics, and a more advanced inventory system. I found
the jumps to feel really wrong and the combat delays to be pretty
painful. The inventory system, once you realize what things are,
is neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that this is a pretty amazing game for its age,
but that a lot about it works against it. The biggest problem is
the lack of continues. The game is too deep on a customization
level to make sense as an arcade game. I presume that later
version of the game change this, because they were designed for
consoles. Secondly, the sprites are a bit too big and they make
it hard to see what&#8217;s going on. Third, the jumps and fighting
don&#8217;t feel quite right.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t play this, but I&#8217;m excited to investigate other games in
this series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like Alien Crush, this game is a very exciting and interesting
pinball table. I feel like this game is a lot crazier because
after the initial ideas in Alien Crush, they were able to go all
out. There&#8217;s lots moving around on the course, there&#8217;s three
layers, and many complicated dependencies between
pieces. In that sense, it&#8217;s much better. Plus, they added a
pass-the-controller 2-player option, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ball physics feel much worse and the ball seems
totally outside of your control. I think part of it is that the
board is broken into three screens and each one is squatter (and
thus more detailed) than any screen was in Alien Crush. At the end
of the day, the game feels worse, despite looking much cooler.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I could imagine playing this game a lot&#8230; if not
for the interface friction.</p>

<p>When I played, my dad and I did the pass-the-controller for a
bit. My best score was 3.7 mil. I got this by getting the castle
on the bottom and then just being super cautious whenever I was
on the bottom screen. It worked like a charm!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the &#8220;living&#8221; board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it&#8217;s not too hard to get used
to.</p>

<p>I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there&#8217;s not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don&#8217;t really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &amp;
weren&#8217;t learning experiences.</p>

<p>I enjoy the game a lot, although I&#8217;m not sure how much I
like <em>this</em> game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.</p>
