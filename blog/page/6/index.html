  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a simple and nice episode that just developed the
interaction between the characters. Some of plot
lines&#8212;feminism, the thief, etc&#8212;are clearly foreshadowing of
greater events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn&#8217;t see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.</p>

<p>The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he&#8217;s a bad businessman because he doesn&#8217;t have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O&#8217;Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.</p>

<p>I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There&#8217;s this
text:</p>

<p>David Edelstein: &#8220;the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk&#8221; &#8211; and
[in the movie] Ted says, &#8220;Wow, what does that even mean?&#8221; and
Audrey says, &#8220;I know, right?&#8221; So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss&#8217; sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don&#8217;t know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren&#8217;t making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really awesome movie. The costumes and visuals were
amazing. The re-writing of the Snow White story was really
cool. Collins looked stunning. I loved the dance scene at the end
too. It was rad. The funny digs were neat too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing this regularly for so long and I&#8217;ve never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that&#8217;s probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to retire this game for a while. I haven&#8217;t really
been playing that much even though I have it scheduled and kind of
want to. I think I need to start again from the beginning with no
assists. I only have the Endurance Races, the Formula GT races,
and the Special Events to get Golds on, but I don&#8217;t want to spend
the time on the Endurance ones and the Formula/Special events are
so technical, I think my skills just aren&#8217;t up to the task. I
think I need to re-learn to play. I&#8217;m going to put it on my
schedule to play it again in January and give it another try. I
can&#8217;t believe how much and how long I&#8217;ve played this game. It&#8217;s
sooo good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn&#8217;t have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they&#8217;re just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.</p>

<p>Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak">A great review</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was appalling! I can&#8217;t believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk&#8217;s death?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now&#8230; even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I&#8217;d like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I&#8217;m basically done with the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It&#8217;s funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There&#8217;s lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.</p>
