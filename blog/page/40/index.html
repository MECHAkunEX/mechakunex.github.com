  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that
comes with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. I remember playing
Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young&#8230; it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don&#8217;t remember doing very well at
it.</p>

<p>I played through this game on the new &#8220;Easy&#8221; setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:</p>

<p>Mission record:
Difficulty: Easy
Play time: 3:03:07
Save: 37
Continue: 23
Alert Mode: 122
Humans Killed: 292
Ration Used: 33
Special Item: Not used
Code Name: Deer</p>

<p>I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.</p>

<p>I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished Shatter.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a &#8220;bullet hall&#8221; influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It&#8217;s really a blast to
play.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.</p>

<p>I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.</p>

<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball&#8217;s movement on them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played through Soldner X-2 on the
PS3.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never really played a &#8220;Euroshmup&#8221; before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)</p>

<p>The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Shoot 1UP, another game from Mommy&#8217;s Best
Games. I also beat this in one sitting on the first try. Very
easy. The gimmick of this game is that you are controlling all
your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I&#8217;d heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.</p>

<p>I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven&#8217;t
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won&#8217;t play it
again.</p>

<p>I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Explosionade, an Xbox Live Indie Game. It
was 41 levels, I played through it in about 30 minutes and did a
1CC on my first try. I didn&#8217;t find it very compelling. The
graphics were crisp and nice. It was cheap, so I&#8217;d say it was
worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Rez on the Dreamcast.</p>

<p>This is a very acclaimed game that I&#8217;ve heard a lot about. It&#8217;s
well-known for its synergy between music, sound effects, visuals,
and actions. It is a Panzer Dragoon-style rail shooter with a
trance soundtrack and trippy theme. You start exploring a computer
system, but as you progress it implies that this computer system
has somehow consumed the real world and you are freeing it and
thus recreating Earth.</p>

<p>The game has really great style and fun gameplay. I had to play
each level (of 5) twice before beating them and I played the 1st
level a third time so I could get 100% to unlock level 5. I did
this over two days. I read online that there are unlockables for
getting more perfect scores, but the gameplay didn&#8217;t compel me to
finish that part of the game.</p>

<p>This game solidifies more for me that I dislike the Dragoon-style
games, probably because I first played Sin &amp; Punishment and
like the ability to dodge too much. I find the gameplay
surprisingly shallow: the key is to chain and destroy things in
basically the order they appear on the screen.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played the game because I have more context
for thinking about games and a better understanding of the history
of this genre and a knowledge of this influential game, but I
won&#8217;t be trying to complete it 100%.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blazing Lazers a few nights ago and tonight. This
is a shooter from 1989 on the PC Engine.</p>

<p>I found the weapons to be really cool. I particularly liked the
laser beam weapon that spread into weird shapes.</p>

<p>I found the hit box really annoying. The hit box is bigger than
the ship graphic and wider than it is vertically, so it is really
difficult to dodge properly, at least when compared to the modern
danmaku shooters I normally play.</p>

<p>I used save states before and after bosses, plus throughout the
final boss battle. In fact, my wife helped me restart a million
times through a particular explosion.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the game was fun, but I like modern shooters
better. I didn&#8217;t like it as much as the shooter that is in Retro
Game Challenge, which is supposedly based on this game.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy. I found out about
the game through <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/2007/02/best-undiscovered-neo-geo-games.html">Racketboy&#8217;s Undiscovered Neo-Geo Games</a> list.</p>

<p>The game is a side-scrolling action game with two planes of
movement. You can jump from one plane to the other and most of the
action in the game revolves around quickly and accurately getting
on the correct plane. Even though there is jumping, this isn&#8217;t
really a platforming game, because it stays on one path mostly and
there are rarely obstacles to jump over. There are four
worlds&#8212;each with two levels, one mid-boss, and one main boss;
followed by a final level with only a boss&#8212;which is actually a
six boss rush.</p>

<p>There are some interesting mechanics in the game. You can grab
things from a distance by stretching your arm. This allows you to
grab things from far away, as well as punch from a distance. Most
of the &#8220;puzzles&#8221; are about doing this effectively. There is a very
low time limit on the game and there are items that allow increase
it by 5, 10, or 20 seconds. I thought this would be stressful, but
I didn&#8217;t notice it at all. (That might have been because I
credit-fed.)</p>

<p>The animation is not nearly as good as Metal Slug, but it is
decent. There is a little bit of quirkiness. For example, there is
a funny animal in the final stage&#8230; the enemies will often wave
white flags at you&#8230; etc. There are some good details too: for
example, most vehicles are destructible and you can throw their
parts at the enemies once they are destroyed.</p>

<p>Overall, the game had a very basic and repetitive design. Most of
the enemies and bosses were dealt with in the same way. I didn&#8217;t
feel it was very deep. I could imagine feeling it was a bit deeper
if I restricted my credit usage. I would typically use 2 on a boss
and .5 on a level. I assume that most of the challenge of getting
credit usage down would be very much luck: enemies hit for a
lot.</p>

<p>I played through it in under an hour. I&#8217;d say it was worth
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I&#8217;m a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I&#8217;d never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It&#8217;s really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335">This review</a> of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn&#8217;t do better. Check that out.</p>

<p>When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, &#8220;This looks
cool.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
