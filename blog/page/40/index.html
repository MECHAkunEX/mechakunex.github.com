  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don&#8217;t think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.</p>

<p>As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn&#8217;t have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s competition, is, of course, Bayonetta&#8212;a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.</p>

<p>At it&#8217;s core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it&#8217;s very fair to compare them.</p>

<p>Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya&#8217;s commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn&#8217;t like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta&#8217;s dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.</p>

<p>In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.</p>

<p>There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a &#8220;strong&#8221; attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can&#8217;t, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.</p>

<p>One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it&#8217;s really not that bad because it&#8217;s so fast and you
basically can&#8217;t fail.)</p>

<p>Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.</p>

<p>On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it &#8220;as a
camera&#8221; rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don&#8217;t recall it ever happening.</p>

<p>But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn&#8217;t have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don&#8217;t remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was very curious about this game because I&#8217;m fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.</p>

<p>Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There&#8217;s no continuous spray of bullets and doesn&#8217;t even
seem to be a normal &#8220;fire&#8221; weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.</p>

<p>I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I&#8217;m too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, I bought Raiden Fighters Aces for the 360 as part of
a bundle of games from the SHMUPS forum.</p>

<p>I played it a few times.</p>

<p>It is a compilation of three old shooters in the same
series. There&#8217;s nothing really spectacular about them and they
aren&#8217;t even visually fantastic. At least they aren&#8217;t emulated
perfectly on MAME. I doubt I&#8217;ll play it many times, but I will
keep it on my list in case I get shmup-desperate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I&#8217;ll play it again unless I&#8217;m totally desperate. I&#8217;d rather
just read something on my phone. I don&#8217;t blame this game though, I
think it&#8217;s really the fault of the phone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game&#8230; how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It&#8217;s pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting&#8212;objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at a point in my life where it&#8217;s not worth it to read books
I&#8217;m not interested in, finish movies that I don&#8217;t love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren&#8217;t rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I&#8217;d like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I&#8217;ll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started on the July 12th and beat the main game on the 19th. I
continued playing the optional content until today. I did all the
extra &#8220;Search&#8221; missions, but I didn&#8217;t want to invest the time to
do every other mission to unlock the /Final/ mission. (So I
watched it on YouTube.) In the end, I cleared 86 missions in
36:22:53.</p>

<p>I thought the game was amazing. It&#8217;s beautiful and the controls
actually feel really nice (unlike Portable Ops, where the controls
were atrocious.) The story is really cool too. The main thing I
didn&#8217;t like about the game is how a lot of the extra content
revolved around incredibly difficult boss fights. (It was about
half that and half stealth missions&#8230; which were all really
fun.)</p>

<p>I thought the pace of unlocking new content was really nice. A big
problem with some games like this is that you feel drowned in the
number of possible options. This has a nice slow drip that feels
rewarding to unlock more. Eventually though, it became too much
for me when there were so many combat missions on the docket.</p>

<p>There were many funny in-jokes in the Metal Gear Universe that I
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the game though was the disgusting Che
worship. Ugh.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I have now played and beat every Metal Gear game that has been
released!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.</p>

<p>I was really excited when the game was announced, because
Castlevania games are basically perfect in my eyes. I was also
excited that it would be multiplayer, because I wanted to have
my wife play with me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as more information about the game came out, I was
pretty disappointed. You can&#8217;t play multiplayer in the same room
and it&#8217;s just the combat sub-system of the game, with a lot of the
progression stripped out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to get it and play it.</p>

<p>I played through the whole game with Alucard. I was originally
planning on playing through with all the characters, going through
the DLC characters and levels, etc&#8230; but after playing through
once I&#8217;m kind of non-plussed about doing that. I expect that it
will be more and more of the same with very little excitement.</p>

<p>While I won&#8217;t play more of it, I did enjoy what I played. It is
very difficult to play by yourself, because there are very few
benefits to grinding and it isn&#8217;t balanced for single player, but
it is very rewarding to conquer and master the boss patterns. In
particular, Death and Dracula each took me a few weeks to
beat. When I finally beat Dracula, I could only take one more hit
and I was in that state for a few minutes&#8230; miraculously dodging
everything. It was pretty rad.</p>

<p>I started the game in April and played about twice a week, then I
switched to playing every two days about two months ago.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.</p>

<p>It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons&#8212;although there are some clear winners overall.</p>

<p>My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can&#8217;t. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend it, but I probably won&#8217;t schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.</p>

<p>There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn&#8217;t check who you needed to
still visit.</p>

<p>All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.</p>
