  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can&#8217;t believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.</p>

<p>The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I&#8217;m really impressed by
this game and can&#8217;t wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.</p>

<p>There are some amazing videos of it online: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y">level 3 (perfect)</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk">1 player 2 player</a>. And <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml">here&#8217;s a description of the story</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I&#8217;d actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn&#8217;t touched
it since.</p>

<p>I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.</p>

<p>There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the last little bit, I played and beat this for the
Nintendo GBA. This is definitely a good entry in the Castlevania
franchise. I really appreciated the variety that came from the
Soul system, but I felt like it had a problem that many RPGs with
these &#8220;collecting&#8221; systems: most of the things you collect are
totally useless. This game had two other problems in my mind:
first, the difficulty curve had a really sharp spike at one point
which required me to grind for almost two hours to get past a
boss; and second, the user interface was really poor and that
complicated switching souls quickly to navigate around the
map. Both of these were fixed in the next entry; in particular the
Doppelganger soul allowed you to have two equipment sets
readied.</p></p>

<p>I will definitely play this again as the secret character, so
maybe I&#8217;ll report back then.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>/Best game ever!/</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe how good this game is. Seriously. I&#8217;m in
shock. Play it; stop reading and play it now. I bought an Xbox 360
for the sole purpose of this game and don&#8217;t regret it at all.</p>

<p>I was worried that it would be too easy and I would get annoyed
(&#8216;cause I only like hard old-school games), so I played it on
Insane (the hardest difficulty) from the start. This mode was
clearly intended to be played after you had done a few
play-throughs and unlocked the golden weapons and gotten high
levels. Until the very end of the game when you get the Inertia
Element and the Fusion Helmet and you reach around level 40, the
game is basically a stealth game. Even with full health upgrades,
you can die almost instantaneously in most rooms. I loved this
though. The very next day after beating it at 100% map and 100%
items, I immediately started again. I love it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought this on the PS3 and played through up to the final
dungeon, but didn&#8217;t want to grind to be able to get through it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of August, I played through FF7 for the first
time in a long time. It definitely is /not/ preserved as well as
Final Fantasy 6. The graphics are just ugly and
distracting. Additionally the game is filled with really annoying
minigames. Ugh. Nevertheless, the game is still pretty good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second GBA Metroid style Castlevania game. I played it
on the plane to and from a conference. It was very fun. There are
few points where the game is really confusing because there is
basically no direction about what you&#8217;re supposed to do and how an
item you got is actually a key. It was frustrating to spend hours
wandering around looking for something that I could do that I
hadn&#8217;t done, but I learned the map really well as a result.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy VI</a> (GBA version) on the DS</p>

<p>I /loved/ this game when it first came out. I remember getting a
SNES for my birthday, but not having any games until Christmas
when I asked for /Final Fantasy III/ (as it was called in the
US&#8230; not that I knew that at the time.) When I finally got it, I
remember talking to a friend later on in the night about how I had
played all day and was already half way through.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t played the game in over ten years, but before then I
played it through many times. Well, this time it was just as
awesome. But rather than just gloat, I&#8217;ll mention some things I
like about it:
- The characters have real depth and it matters who is in your
party in most situations as they react differently.
- The characters have unique battle personas for most of the game,
due to their useful special commands; although sadly this
degrades a little bit in the end game when magic is essential
for everything.
- The world is interesting with many connections that you don&#8217;t
need to notice unless you care to look. For example, the woman
in love with the fallen soldier in Mobliz or Shadow&#8217;s dreams in
the World of Ruin.
- The final battle is very unique with multiple parties and
different tiers with different status effect carry overs.
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M">The Opera Scene</a> (and portions of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGpIWD39Ngw">remake</a> and a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NC45S948ss][live version
with the New Japan Philharmonic]]&#8212;definitely watch the live
version and after the original.)
- Speaking of that scene, the music is amazing.
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCXGVNvtxkc">Imp</a>
- The multiple party dungeon system is neat, but see below.
- The split-up at the beginning of the game is very neat as well.</p>

<p>However, there are something I don&#8217;t like (and unfortunately not
many games have got them right either):
- In the end game, it feels like any party is just as good as
another because of magic.
- The multiple party dungeons are tedious when characters aren&#8217;t
equally leveled and the only way to get them there is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming">grind</a>),
which sucks.
- Gau, Mog, Relm, and Strago&#8217;s special commands are very cool when
you think about them but are very hard to use well. Gau in
particular requires <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/930370/50814">PhD to use well</a>.
- You can play the entire game and never see a [[http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Desperation_Attack][desperation
attack]]. (Before I read the FAQs, I had played the game three or
four times and only seen them twice.)</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do Dragon&#8217;s Den. I primarily used
Terra/Celes/Sabin/Mog->Umaro->Gogo</p>
