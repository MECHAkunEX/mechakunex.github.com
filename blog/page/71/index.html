  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing this. Castlevania&#8230; how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:</p>

<p>The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She&#8217;s beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn&#8217;t fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she&#8217;s wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she&#8217;s absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.</p>

<p>The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated&#8230; I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.</p>

<p>The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits&#8230; some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That&#8217;s something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and &#8220;makes sense&#8221;. This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula&#8217;s Castle it is huge.</p>

<p>The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.</p>

<p>The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.</p>

<p>The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don&#8217;t
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game&#8217;s combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn&#8217;t really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops&#8212;like Arma Felix, so cool!)</p>

<p>I recommend this game, no reservations!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For almost the past two months, I have been playing Sin and
Punishment: Hoshi no Keishōsha every day. In the beginning, I
could only get through about 15 minutes of the game, so it fit
well into my rotation. As I got towards the end, I would play
every day, get to right before the final boss and die, losing
about 45 minutes of my life every time. But! I loved it so much!
It is so satisfying to play this game and slowly get better at
getting through each boss, each segment; learning how to get more
and more enemies and points. At times I feel like I&#8217;m playing a
beautiful piano piece that I&#8217;ve practiced for so long.</p>

<p>When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t know about the sword or that you
could knock back projectiles at enemies, so once I learned I
quickly got past some of my previous bottlenecks. My favourite
part of the game is when you control Airan: running through the
ship with her, fighting Leda, going on the chase, and destroying
the fleet is just so&#8230; EPIC! Then, the subway sequence is really
fun, but honestly, not as cool as the ship sequence. The first and
second parts with Saki are fine, but the side-scrolling final
stage is awesome. The difficulty in the game is perfect. Even
though I got through the final boss on my first try, it was insane
and frenetic. I ended with about 564 hit points left on the Earth,
which started around 30k, so I clearly didn&#8217;t do an amazing
job. But it was awesome.</p>

<p>The music is great for its era (although wifey reports that she
got pretty tired of it.) The visuals hold up very well actually,
because everything is so big. Ya, the textures in the backgrounds
are really blurry, but it actually gives an apocalyptic and fast
paced feel. The controls are really smooth&#8230; although I didn&#8217;t
play on a N64 controller. (I used the best controller ever aka
arcade stick. I mapped the top three buttons to: strafe left,
fire, strafe right, lock-on/manual. Then the bottom left button to
jump so that I just laid my hand down and never had to move it. I
feel like the game was easier this way because I used more digits
than the N64 controller would &#8220;fit.&#8221;) I love the pacing and the
simple (but interesting) scoring system.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for the sequel, Sin and Punishment: Sora no Kōkeisha
to come out. If it doesn&#8217;t make it over, I&#8217;ll definitely have to
import a Japanese Wii or something to play it. I heart it.</p>

<p>Now the final business: My score. I played on Easy for this first
play-through. (I will do Normal soon.) I got 44,214,705 points,
spent 46 minutes and 41 seconds and got 2033 enemies. This is all
on one credit, of course.</p>

<p>Love it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.</p>

<p>This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn&#8217;t get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn&#8217;t get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
<a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=46&amp;gi=6946&amp;vi=7899">2,122,630</a>, but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)</p>

<p>I used lots of save states and I don&#8217;t think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn&#8217;t get to level 10.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wifey and I just beat World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck for the Genesis. This is a two player platformer
released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. It is really fun that you
have to cooperate with another person: sometimes you need to stand
on each other&#8217;s shoulders, pull the other player through a small
hole, or use a handcar together. There is also friendly fire in
the game, which is definitely exciting and forces you to really
communicate.</p>

<p>We played through all but the final level in one go a few weeks
ago, but we lost all our tries right near the end and waited until
tonight to finish it. We got back through all those parts and to
the final boss, but he creamed us up front. The problem was that
we didn&#8217;t know where to attack him. This is typical of this game:
it does a very poor job communicating to you what you need to do
to advance. For example, there are these doors in the final area
that are very hard to open because you don&#8217;t know what button to
press. Simple, but annoying.</p>

<p>Overall, the game is a nice quick platforming experience and I
think my wife liked it; and that&#8217;s saying something! I can&#8217;t wait to
play through the new Super Mario Brothers for the Wii with her.</p>

<p>We used Save States in the final area to conserve lives, but beat
the final boss on one try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she&#8217;s been waiting a long time for me.</p>

<p>I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the
second quest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo on the PC
Engine CD.</p>

<p>This game is /amazing/. The levels are all so unique and
interesting. They are all challenging and the boss are
particularly frustrating, but totally satisfying and fun. I loved
being able to play as Maria after I rescued her. I can&#8217;t wait to
play Symphony of the Night again and pay attention to the
interactions with Maria. The game is definitely easier with her. I
only played with her through the alternate route and I beat
Dracula with both Richter and Maria. Naturally I also got 100%,
but I&#8217;d like to play it again sometime and go with Maria through
the primary route and Richter through the alternate route.</p></p>

<p>Update: One more thing. If you&#8217;ve played a Castlevania game,
you know how when you beat a boss, this magic sphere appears that
refills your health or advances you to the next level. I
/always/ jump to get it. It is so much fun!</p>

<p>I /absolutely/ recommend this game!</p>

<p>Finished with these paths:
Richter:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> Final
Prisoners: 2, 7</p>

<p>Maria:
1 -> 2&#8217; -> 3&#8217; -> 4&#8217; -> 5&#8217; -> 6 + Final
Prisoners: 3&#8217;, 4&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The &#8220;vibe&#8221; system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn&#8217;t proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn&#8217;t about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn&#8217;t finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you&#8217;re in for some frustration and annoyance.</p>
