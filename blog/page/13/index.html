  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this on opening day, because my wife was going with some
friends and someone fell through, so I took the last ticket. I have
never read the books, so I don&#8217;t really have opinions or
predilections about it. I thought the world was neat. They did a
good job showing the opulence of the people in the capitol, but I
don&#8217;t think they really made the oppression disgusting enough. The
action was fun and she was pretty heroic&#8212;I found myself tearing
up a few times. I find the world to be pretty unbelievable
though. I don&#8217;t understand how the people in the capitol could be
supportive of the oppression, when they don&#8217;t seem to be kept in
the dark or otherwise &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; into thinking that they are
doing great things for the districts. Similarly, I don&#8217;t understand
why they would not take better care of the districts or why the
districts would not have already gone on strike. The idea that this
could go on for 74 years strains credulity. I don&#8217;t think Katniss
is a very consistent character. The movie communicated to me that
she was all about doing the right thing and would rather die than
not do that; yet, she doesn&#8217;t do a whole lot against &#8220;the man&#8221;. For
example, when she talks to Peter at night before the games start,
he says he wants to show that he is not &#8220;owned&#8221; and she agrees, but
says she&#8217;d like to go home. The way this scene plays out and how
she is so non-aggressive during the games said to me that she
really agreed with him. Yet, she never actually does anything to go
against them. Dying together at the end is a little bit like that,
but you get the impression that she knew they wouldn&#8217;t let her do
it, and therefore it was an empty calculation rather than a
confident objection. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I
felt like it could be more. My wife says that it is part one of a
trilogy and my wishes will come true in some way in the
future. That&#8217;s fine&#8230; but&#8230; it&#8217;s annoying when you need to know
something about the real world to appreciate a movie&#8230; when it
can&#8217;t satisfy you on its own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I listened to the <a href="http://www.crunkgames.com/?p%3D380">Crunk Games</a> Dragon Quest special and Alex said
something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
&#8220;Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill.&#8221; They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless &#8220;put in the hours&#8221; work and study
experiences. I&#8217;ve heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t like about
them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game in Arcade mode today (normally, I play it once
a month and I&#8217;ve been doing Ragnar&#8217;s story) and got to the end. I
think I will try some of the other characters over the next little
bit, but I&#8217;ll practically consider it mostly done. I like Street
Fighter much more given my experience with this game. The story is
super super Anime. The graphics are gorgeous. But, the systems are
not as appealing or intuitive to me, but I have more experience
with SF, so I like it better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This an intense movie. It has a very surreal fighting choreography
style that is reminiscent of Crouching Tiger but much more
crazy. Each of the shinobi have very diverse and interesting
&#8220;arts&#8221;. I love how the main characters seem like the wimps the
whole movie until they are finally forced to fight and they have
The Real Ultimate Power. It&#8217;s very cool. The movie is also
incredibly sad and emotional; it is fittingly tragic for a Romeo &amp;
Juliet-like story. I love the resolve of Oboro at the end. She&#8217;s
super tough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is on par with the last one and perhaps a slight step
down. It is much less globe-trotting, with essentially four
sets&#8212;the Tokyo office (small), Alaska (small), the LA Prison
(large), and the Arcadia (small).</p>

<p>The opening fight is caraaaazy and has a lot of the elements of the
third movie where you think you&#8217;re watching <em>the Alice</em> but
aren&#8217;t. I was disappointed that Alice lost her powers almost
instantly, but I think it is probably good for the movie that she
lost them, because they make her too unstoppable&#8230; but it still
fun to have her as a super hero. They don&#8217;t explain at all how she
recovers from the crash, separates from Wesker, doesn&#8217;t reconnect
to her supplies / more clones in Nevada, etc. But whatever :)</p>

<p>The Claire pick-up is kind of strange at the time, but the
resolution of what she was doing is pretty awesome by the end of
the movie. It was a genuine surprise and I liked it a lot. By the
way, Ali Larter. Wow.</p>

<p>One of the worst things about this movie is how horrible the actor
who plays Wesker is. He&#8217;s way to stiff and &#8220;too cool for school&#8221;. I
can see what he was going for&#8230; by not moving very much he&#8217;s
trying to act above the situation, but it comes across as really
stupid.</p>

<p>The ultimate action of the movie is strange because it is
practically a meaningless excursion&#8212;only Chris and Luther survive
and Luther barely does. It doesn&#8217;t really do anything to advance
the mythos, just that Wesker is a tough guy and Umbrella continues
to experiment on people. I&#8217;d like them pursue that fact that really
only Umbrella has a chance of saving the world and if they weren&#8217;t
such punks, Alice should be helping them. What does she expect to
do? She really has no motivation besides revenge and helping out
survivors (but mostly they just die because she&#8217;s around.) I found
it interesting in the beginning that she clearly blames herself for
the outbreak. Is she referring to planning a robbery? Or being
involved in the first movie? It&#8217;s unclear what she is talking
about.</p>

<p>The new kinds of zombies in this movie are interesting and appear
with almost no notice by the characters. The &#8220;Majini&#8221; zombies are
super creepy. The big &#8220;butcher&#8221; guy was weird; I expected him to be
like a rogue Nemesis, but they don&#8217;t really go into at all.</p>

<p>The ending is pretty insane. First, Wikipedia says that a figure
parachutes away from the explosion of Wesker&#8217;s plane, but I didn&#8217;t
see that. (Just watched a video of that and it&#8217;s pretty clear. When
I first saw the ending, I didn&#8217;t realize what the smudge in the
background was, but now it is clear.) Weird. Second, every movie
ends with an opening for the next movie, but 2 and 3 end of very
happy resolutions. 1 is less happy, but still Alice is in a
position of control and power. This ending is a pretty bad
cliff-hanger because they are literally about to be blown
away. Where are all these Umbrella goons hiding? It was not at all
clear to me that the woman in command of the attack was Jill
Valentine, because she had different hair color. Weird. (I watched
the ending again and it still doesn&#8217;t look like her, but the voice
sounds just like her.)</p>

<p>As I was watching, my PS3 detected a Cinavia watermark. What cool
technology! I had to switch to watching on the PC.</p>

<p>It is interesting that this movie made significantly more money
than the others. Good for them. The production value is definitely
up from the others. (Although I&#8217;d say that only the second was
&#8220;bad&#8221; on that front. The first wasn&#8217;t good, but I think it was good
for its time.)</p>

<p>Regarding the Wikipedia summary of the reception: I agree that
there is a large amount of slow motion which seems incredibly
tedious&#8212;especially in Claire&#8217;s fight in the shower. The action is
slower paced in general, but I think that is good, because you can
appreciate it more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It&#8217;s basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We&#8217;ve gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine&#8212;again
there&#8217;s basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it&#8217;s fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the &#8220;domesticated&#8221; zombie acts. It&#8217;s really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.</p>

<p>On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe&#8230; inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.</p>
