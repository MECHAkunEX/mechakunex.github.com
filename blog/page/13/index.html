  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to beat this game today. I used a cheat code to give
infinite lines, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about continues and
replaying sections over and over (at least, until I got passed
them once, or in the case of the stage before a boss battle, more
times.) However, even with that, I was able to get to
Frankenstein&#8217;s in 3 lives. I took another three to get to stage
15 (the stage that ends in Death.) I did all that in about 30
minutes. I played the stage before Death for about 25 minutes
before church. Then I had a very NES moment and left the system
running while I was at church.</p>

<p>When I got back, I played Death&#8217;s sequence over and over again
for an hour and a half. Eventually I decided to focus on not
losing any life at all during the hallway with the two axe
knights and the brutal Medusa heads, by willingly sacrificing
lots of hearts. This turned out to be a good move and I gradually
improved. It took maybe three times of getting to Death with full
health before I defeated him. It was awesome.</p>

<p>It only took about 15 minutes to get to Dracula after that. It
took another hour and a half before I beat Dracula. It got to the
point where I could get passed the first form without taking any
damage pretty reliably, but then I had to work on my moves to
fight the second form. Eventually I decided to try the potion
rather than the cross, because the cross didn&#8217;t seem to do much
damage. This was an awesome move. The potion doesn&#8217;t do any
damage, but it stunlocks him so he can&#8217;t move. Provided I didn&#8217;t
have the double shot, I was able to lay into him for two hits,
then stun, then repeat. I was triumphant!</p>

<p>Altogether, I beat the game in about four hours. It felt so good
to do it. Even though I used a code, it was a pretty weak code
because I had to do everything. It&#8217;s a good example about what
I&#8217;d like games to do&#8212;be like spaced repetition systems (like
Anki), have me do a stage until I can beat it reliably, then move
on, but don&#8217;t show me something that is now easy (or moderate,
but with random swings all the time.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I gave this game a chance. Initially, the controls
felt so gross, but now I really love their unique stickiness.</p>

<p>Cycle time: 3:58

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn&#8217;t notice anything wrong with Allison&#8217;s dancing. I&#8217;m
one of the &#8220;80% who don&#8217;t know anything about ballet&#8221;. It&#8217;s kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it&#8217;s all beautiful and can&#8217;t notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family&#8230; she
don&#8217;t seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>

for Allison. She seems really great, but in a lot of pain and
Rex isn&#8217;t being the best for her.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool &#8220;abilitease&#8221;. I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I&#8217;ve
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn&#8217;t realize it. But
now, it&#8217;s quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It&#8217;s cute so far though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn&#8217;t
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn&#8217;t (Craig&#8217;s conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts&#8217; character was very cute,
although we don&#8217;t learn anything about her, other than that she&#8217;s
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don&#8217;t really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

I&#8217;d heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very

to be used to so badly your whole life&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we played for about an hour and a half. I beat three of the
Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can&#8217;t dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a &#8220;bullet&#8221; is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn&#8217;t get
passed the title screen&#8230; it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn&#8217;t get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>
