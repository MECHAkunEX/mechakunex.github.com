  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley&#8217;s Castle
today.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don&#8217;t
remember ever getting to Wiley&#8217;s Castle, and especially not
through it. I&#8217;m kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don&#8217;t normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I&#8217;m just remembering it being harder than
it was? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man&#8217;s
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s anything that isn&#8217;t polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.</p>

<p>This game is amazing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played The Legend of Zelda on my AV Famicom with a RetroZone
PowerPak. It was awesome.</p>

<p>I started on Monday and played for about an hour while the <em>REDACTED</em>
was asleep. I got to the 2nd Dungeon, but got my butt kicked
pretty bad. I played yesterday and spent a lot of time in the
beginning crawling the map buying everything and finding all the
heart containers I could, then I got up to the 6th Dungeon in a
few hours. Today, I took it the rest of the way. I found the 6th
Dungeon to be very hard. I was able to complete the last dungeon
with two visits: the first one got me all the items and got me
familiar with the layout, but when I got to Ganon, I died, because
I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try&#8212;I only
used one potion too.</p>

<p>I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn&#8217;t shoot arrows (they consume money.)</p>

<p>It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don&#8217;t remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad&#8217;s map.</p>

<p>I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult&#8212;much more so than modern Zelda games&#8212;but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn&#8217;t
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I&#8217;ve been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I&#8217;ve been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.</p>

<p>I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don&#8217;t like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it&#8217;s pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the depth I&#8217;d like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.</p>

<p>The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It&#8217;s simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there&#8217;s no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn&#8217;t play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn&#8217;t totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.</p>

<p>Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don&#8217;t
need it.</p>

<p>The most appropriate word for this game is &#8220;fantastic&#8221; in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.</p>

<p>The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you&#8217;ve
seen or thought of before and doesn&#8217;t really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels&#8217; tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you&#8217;re walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It&#8217;s
really quite amazing.</p>

<p>What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It&#8217;s very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.</p>

<p>The story is baffling. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it&#8217;s baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There&#8217;s something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.</p>

<p>When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don&#8217;t think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don&#8217;t feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a must player.</p>

<p>Best Reader: YOU</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/">JC Fletcher&#8217;s review</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet.&#8221; and &#8220;If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing &#8230; your dream has been
fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played inFAMOUS last night. I&#8217;m glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the &#8220;So, sorry, Sony&#8221; program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.</p>

<p>At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.</p>

<p>The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.</p>

<p>I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.</p>

<p>Ba-leted!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This sounded like a really cool game: a combination of a shooter
and an adventure game where you travel through connected stages,
etc. Unfortunately, I found it impossible to understand what I was
supposed to do. I intend to give it another chance, maybe after
reading a manual, but I couldn&#8217;t cope with it when I tried it the
first time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played LittleBigPlanet last night too, which I got as part of
the same promotion as inFAMOUS. I had played the demo before.</p>

<p>This game is amazingly adorable. The team introduction in the
first level is adorable too.</p>

<p>This could have been a really charming and enjoyable game,
but&#8230;.</p>

<p>Wow, bad controls. So bad, I&#8217;m not actually interested in playing
it anymore. Really disappointing.</p>

<p>Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Raiden IV a bit. I played through to the end of the game,
including the second loop. I basically credit-fed the second loop
after making it to the second loop in a legit way. My best score
was 17,036,000. (A little short of the 20mil to get the last point
achievement.)</p>

<p>One thing I really liked about the game is that there were
massive, beautiful explosions and the way the ground spins, moves,
and feels really deep. I also liked the way the final boss appears
to be The Stone-Like. The weapon selection is pretty cool. It
reminds me a lot of Blazing Lazers.</p>

<p>There were quite a few things I didn&#8217;t like, though.</p>

<p>The size of the hit-box is really unclear and seems large.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel like the enemy bullets pop out of the background and
your bullets enough.</p>

<p>The game feels like it is cheating when you try to dodge some
shots. Specifically there are many times where the field is bigger
than the screen, so when you move to the left or right you move
across the background but basically stay in the same spot. This
feels like cheating because the bullets move with
you&#8212;effectively making it like you can&#8217;t dodge.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it when snipers come on-screen and then go to the
bottom of the screen and shoot up at you. I was thinking about
other shooters and couldn&#8217;t think of situations where you have to
dodge what is behind you&#8212;except in boss segments where the
screen is fixed and you&#8217;re not scrolling anymore. This last point
doesn&#8217;t seem broken; it is a legitimate gameplay choice, but I
don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t go in my rotation, but I got $10 worth of fun.</p>
