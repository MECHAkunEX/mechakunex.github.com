  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was appalling! I can&#8217;t believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk&#8217;s death?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now&#8230; even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I&#8217;d like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I&#8217;m basically done with the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It&#8217;s funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There&#8217;s lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to wait around for a long time today, so I played for about
40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn&#8217;t use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn&#8217;t use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I&#8217;ll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew&#8217;s distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two and half hours tonight. I&#8217;ve been taking a
break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot&#8230; it made it more
dramatic. It&#8217;s also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I&#8217;m glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane&#8217;s voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments&#8230; it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can&#8217;t have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan&#8217;s insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago&#8230; I forget when&#8230; we played again, beat the first
temple and got some items in the world. My son really enjoys
watching it.</p>

<p>Today we played up to the boss in the Tower of Hera, but were
totally creamed. It is tough. I keep getting knocked off and then
his health is reset.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun, fast-paced action movie. I liked how the world of
the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.</p>

interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They&#8217;ve laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>
