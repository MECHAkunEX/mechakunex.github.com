  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I&#8217;m in an area
now with just one person in my group and it&#8217;s quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I&#8217;m
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It&#8217;s not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven&#8217;t
died since I restarted.</p>

<p>I made it through a bunch more areas (I&#8217;m about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don&#8217;t know.) It&#8217;s almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don&#8217;t see
the global path so you don&#8217;t get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn&#8217;t find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
&#8220;side&#8221; quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places&#8230; kind
of a hole&#8230; that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren&#8217;t totally showing, it gets a little real and that&#8217;s
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting&#8230; the concept of remnants is neat. They&#8217;re basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I&#8217;m just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don&#8217;t understand how to optimize it,
so I&#8217;m just getting by.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on my last experience with the game, I think I&#8217;m basically
done with the game. I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play&#8212;5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren&#8217;t tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don&#8217;t think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I&#8217;m doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn&#8217;t quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can&#8217;t remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn&#8217;t noticed because I hadn&#8217;t play SMB
yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to be basically done with these games. Both are not
nearly as good as Deathsmiles, ESPgaluda II, or Mushihime-sama
Futari. Pink Sweets isn&#8217;t even really good at all for me. Both
lack the insane music and really popping/flowing feel of the other
games. I think I might play MMP every once in a while to
experience it a little bit, but it&#8217;s not something I love at
all. Overall, a bit of a bad purchase, seeing as I brought it back
from Japan myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved&#8212;I don&#8217;t know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I&#8217;ve played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear doing it
all over again I don&#8217;t think. At least not right away, I&#8217;ll try
again tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.</p>

<p>First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn&#8217;t unbearable, but it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad &#8220;dead
eye&#8221; syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren&#8217;t great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.</p>

<p>Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.</p>

<p>On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can&#8217;t actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it&#8217;s a strategy
game where positioning isn&#8217;t directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.</p>

<p>On another level, it&#8217;s kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select &#8220;Attack&#8221;, &#8220;Magic&#8221;, or &#8220;Item&#8221; and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey&#8217;s) sometimes during them. Except that you don&#8217;t
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don&#8217;t actually choose
which skills you will use, like &#8220;Magic > Fire&#8221;, you just choose
&#8220;Magic&#8221;. Except that all your skills aren&#8217;t always available, for
example, you can only choose &#8220;Heal&#8221; when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.</p>

<p>It is really strange.</p>

<p>Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven&#8217;t
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles (&#8220;Press A to Win&#8221;-style). Tomorrow
I&#8217;ll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I plan on starting this game today. I thought I&#8217;d write about my
expectations before I played it.</p>

<p>Like Blue Dragon, I&#8217;d heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;next gen&#8221; games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I&#8217;ve heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don&#8217;t
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I&#8217;ve
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don&#8217;t really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.</p>

<p>I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I&#8217;m skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m pretty excited about seeing what it is like.</p>
