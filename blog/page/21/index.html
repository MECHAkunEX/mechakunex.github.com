  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I played for a little less than three hours and finished
the game. I went through the Catacombs and then to the final
boss. I beat the Pinwheel boss and Nito on my first try. After I
got back to the Firelink Shrine, it took me a long time to figure
out that I just needed to jump down the pit to get back to the
Lordvessel. I did it the first time very nervously. I fought the
boss once and got creamed, then did a few of the upgrades I could
on my gear and then went back and beat him on my second try. After
I watched the ending, I had a big&#8230; that was it? Just explode
into the flame?</p>

<p>&#8211; Review &#8211;</p>

<p>This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It&#8217;s exactly like Demon&#8217;s Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon&#8217;s Souls.</p>

<p>I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could&#8217;ve been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren&#8217;t a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.</p>

<p>The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I&#8217;m undead, there&#8217;s a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don&#8217;t really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls story was very
coherent.</p>

<p>The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it&#8217;s all interconnected. It&#8217;s very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly &#8220;level&#8221;-y.</p>

<p>I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon&#8217;s. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don&#8217;t
think it really evolved that much.</p>

<p>The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn&#8217;t even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last&#8230; maybe I
just found a better farming spot.</p>

<p>The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon&#8217;s, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don&#8217;t really find the
game that difficult&#8230; just a good challenge&#8230; like Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon&#8217;s. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks&#8212;about the same
amount of total days, I think.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the game. But, I won&#8217;t be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I&#8217;d really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.</p>

<p>The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.</p>

<p>The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I&#8217;m glad that the characters realize this
too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny because when she&#8217;s in the field, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.</p>

<p>The real moment of Katniss&#8217; catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.</p>

<p>The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.</p>

<p>I find the term &#8220;Mockingjay&#8221; used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)</p>

<p>I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol&#8230; tense!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I played for a little less than four hours. I went from the
Duke&#8217;s Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good&#8230; still hard because you&#8217;ve got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up&#8230;
it&#8217;s all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow&#8230; just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.</p>

<p>I &#8220;love&#8221; seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.</p>

<p>I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there&#8217;s no doubt about
that, but I&#8217;m not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.</p>

<p>The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It&#8217;s as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn&#8217;t possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.</p>

<p>I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>I teared up in the District 11 scene.</p>

<p>Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?</p>

<p>It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.</p>

<p>Haymitch&#8217;s story is great.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;food porn&#8221; in the books never gets old, strangely.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; private session with the Gamemakers :)</p>

<p>The pre-Games interviews were amazing.</p>

<p>The end of Part II is waaaay intense.</p>

<p>I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss&#8217; body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s &#8220;naked&#8221; or talk about
her &#8220;breasts&#8221; and most often she mentions her &#8220;underwear&#8221;,
&#8220;underclothes&#8221;, or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;. It&#8217;s particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we&#8217;re so often given.</p>

<p>The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m disappointed the movie didn&#8217;t use the plot-point about the
&#8220;traitor&#8221; that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It&#8217;s a cool
idea.</p>

<p>I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine the audience really being excited about
it.</p>

<p>Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It&#8217;s very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn&#8217;t as touching.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn&#8217;t continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.</p>
