  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the rest of the game&#8230; meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn&#8217;t particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn&#8217;t really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn&#8217;t anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn&#8217;t dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There&#8217;s one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can&#8217;t survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

totally destroyed. I hope it isn&#8217;t too much longer, because it is
getting a little tired. Nothing really to say else about the
game play today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second Kurosawa film that I&#8217;ve seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
&#8220;psychedelic&#8221; scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I finished getting As or above on every event in Pac-Man CE
DX. My ranking across the whole game is 5,100/245,281 or in the
top 2.07%. It&#8217;s a really fun game. I think I like the normal mode
the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it&#8217;s too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I&#8217;m now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I&#8217;ll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene&#8217;s fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight&#8230; wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don&#8217;t think I would have really minded too
much&#8230; unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42&#8230; which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I&#8217;m liking Maru more and more. He&#8217;s so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene&#8217;s mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He&#8217;s not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they&#8217;ll get them
back and save the day&#8230; but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a pretty bad movie, but bad in that way that Pringles are,
where you think they are good while you&#8217;re eating them, but every
so often you think &#8220;What am I doing?&#8221; and afterward as you reflect
on it, you regret. You should read the Wikipedia page on the
Critical Reception. I very much agree. There are a few funny
moments, but overall it feels so fake. The best part is how
realistic the tour members are. I direct tours, actually, and I
find a lot of it to be true to life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene&#8217;s character&#8212;and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery&#8212;is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.</p>

<p>I got all the skills for a few classes, so I&#8217;ve made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they&#8217;ve dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.</p>
