  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the existence of this game and I have been since
I heard that it existed. I played the game for about twenty
minutes in all Japanese. I was able to understand the menus, but I
didn&#8217;t do much more than sound out the dialogue. The graphics are
ridiculously racist. The concept of the game is nuts and based on
my brief playing and a glance at a walkthrough&#8230; it is
transparent fetch quest with RPG battles in between. In some way,
this can be said of all RPGs, but it would be far too transparent
for me, given my limited grasp of the language. I wasn&#8217;t able to
walk to the first fetch quest delivery point and back without
dying.</p>

<p>Grinding is really the worst thing for old RPGs. Many of them had
interesting mechanics, but were padded for their day. In more
modern times, this padding is really destructive if you want to
experience what was interesting about the game. There&#8217;s no good
way to use codes and cheats to give a challenging, but still
non-tedious experience. There are ways to just pre-load with
super powers and get infinite experience, but that&#8217;s little
better than just watching the game on YouTube.</p>

<p>As I get older I&#8217;m much more interested in games without
progression systems because from the second you start you&#8217;re
faced with a test to learn new skills and apply them. The tests
get harder, but there&#8217;s no artificial curve in the game. In other
games with internal progression systems, the progression is more
than just numeric&#8230; it requires more strategy and planning. For
example, Dragon Quest 1 is basically just about getting higher
numbers until you can get even higher numbers. There&#8217;s little
strategy involved&#8230; just a test of how much risk you&#8217;re willing
to take. In contrast, FF6 adds more party members, complicated
enemy patterns, many spells, etc as the game progresses.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where Tom Sawyer fits in this rubric, but I&#8217;m not
going to give it a chance. I have dipped into its existence and
found it very curious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn&#8217;t make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn&#8217;t get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I&#8217;m doing terribly, but
it doesn&#8217;t communicate to me in any way what I&#8217;m doing wrong. In
addition, I&#8217;m now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games&#8230; even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can&#8217;t. Argh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game (via the prototype ROM dump) for a bit
today. It&#8217;s clear that this was the precursor to Earthbound. The
dialogue is great and the enemies are very odd.</p>

<p>It is also clear that it is a straight Dragon Quest clone. I was
not able to make it from the front door of my house to town
without dying. It took three trips before I reached a high enough
level to make it. When I got there, I had about $250 in cash, but
the next worthwhile weapon was $500. Classic. I started walking
around and was decimated by the first zombie on the way to the
cemetery (plot point #1).</p>

<p>During my short play, I noticed a few typos. This, combined with
the anticipatory pain of grinding, has led me to decide to replay
it on the Mother 1+2 remake for the GBA with the fan translation
that adds the &#8220;Easy Ring&#8221; option. I was definitely convinced that
I want to play this game, but not convinced by the NES version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I beat three levels after about forty minutes of play. This game
is very similar to Super Mario Brothers 2. It&#8217;s focused around
picking up blocks and throwing them, although you can throw them
in more directions in this game. The co-op play is a memorable
feature, although I played by myself.</p>

<p>The platforming is pretty good, but the hit detection against
projectiles and enemies is too imprecise&#8230; you can get hits
registered that look very far away from your character. This
annoyance combined with the extreme speed of a lot of the enemies
(particularly the flying ones) leads to a lot of frustration. The
boss of the third level is really vicious because it zooms across
the screen and drops two moving creatures that have big hit
boxes.</p>

<p>The first boss fight is super easy once you realize what you need
to do and is pretty bland. The third is more interesting, but
also flawed because you can&#8217;t effective shot in mid-air because
you fall so quickly.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a C+ NES platformer. It&#8217;s not
horrific&#8230; it&#8217;s certainly playable (unlike TMNT, for instance)
but it by no means enters the canon, and I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s really
worth my time. If I could have used a Game Genie code to get
infinite lives, I would have done it though and taken one screen
at a time. As it stands, the three lives per continue and three
continues barrier is too high for me to go through imperfect
mechanics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for a bit. It&#8217;s definitely better than the
last one. It seems a lot more deep and complex. It&#8217;s got this
non-linear-ness to it which is interesting, but the controls are
still pretty sloppy. There were many times when I just couldn&#8217;t
line up with an enemy and it was on top of me doing damage every
time it was possible. I&#8217;m still hopeful for the next sequel. But
this game doesn&#8217;t do it for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this for one run of about ten minutes. I got to 1-3. I
could very easily tell that this game was a novelty of its day:
Mario in Portable form! Today, there&#8217;s no reason to play
this. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s bad&#8230; but the limitations of the Game
Boy are way too awkward to really enjoy it. There are some cool
things though, such as the rolling boulders and the different
enemy types, but there&#8217;s no reason to play this when you&#8217;re at
home (or even with the hand-held options that are available
today.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for about a half-hour. I was a Human Female,
Human Male, Mutant Female, and Human Male. I sold my Saber, bought
some armor and went out to fight. It took the whole thirty minutes
to be able to afford one more piece of armor. I went out to fight
again and got into a fight with a Red Bull, during the course of
the fight, all my weapons broke and two of my characters died,
then the monster fled, so I didn&#8217;t get to kill and didn&#8217;t get any
gold. Now I don&#8217;t have the money to replace the weapons or revive
the fallen characters. This game seems like it will be nothing
but Kawazu brutalization and grinding. No thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for almost an hour tonight. It is brilliant in
its simple setup, but complex puzzles. The controls are
horrible&#8212;you can&#8217;t turn in mid-step, you can&#8217;t stop on stairs,
and you don&#8217;t always use a special attack when you think you
will. The graphics are horrific. The music is about 4 notes
repeated. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s a really addicting and satisfying
game. It&#8217;s neat that you can watch replays of your last
attempt. This game is very similar to Lolo-style games, but
different enough that it feels unique. I was very impressed.</p>

<p>On the Game Boy, apparently it has 80 levels, and I did 31. I
think I burnt myself out on it in the one sitting I did. I will
definitely play this again, and probably pick up where I was
before, but I&#8217;ll mark it as done because I think I understand the
game pretty thoroughly and (like the Crush games) I can&#8217;t really
binge on it.</p>
