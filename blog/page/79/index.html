  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo on the PC
Engine CD.</p>

<p>This game is /amazing/. The levels are all so unique and
interesting. They are all challenging and the boss are
particularly frustrating, but totally satisfying and fun. I loved
being able to play as Maria after I rescued her. I can&#8217;t wait to
play Symphony of the Night again and pay attention to the
interactions with Maria. The game is definitely easier with her. I
only played with her through the alternate route and I beat
Dracula with both Richter and Maria. Naturally I also got 100%,
but I&#8217;d like to play it again sometime and go with Maria through
the primary route and Richter through the alternate route.</p></p>

<p>Update: One more thing. If you&#8217;ve played a Castlevania game,
you know how when you beat a boss, this magic sphere appears that
refills your health or advances you to the next level. I
/always/ jump to get it. It is so much fun!</p>

<p>I /absolutely/ recommend this game!</p>

<p>Finished with these paths:
Richter:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> Final
Prisoners: 2, 7</p>

<p>Maria:
1 -> 2&#8217; -> 3&#8217; -> 4&#8217; -> 5&#8217; -> 6 + Final
Prisoners: 3&#8217;, 4&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a recent trip, I played Super Princess Peach for the
Nintendo DS. It was a fun little platformer. The &#8220;vibe&#8221; system was
really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn&#8217;t proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn&#8217;t about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn&#8217;t finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you&#8217;re in for some frustration and annoyance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my last trip, I played through this game. I thought the
environment was really fresh relative to the last few Castlevania
games I&#8217;ve played and I enjoyed the partner system a lot, although
I felt like I didn&#8217;t have as much use for <em>REDACTED</em>lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I&#8217;m really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don&#8217;t think I will for a while.</p>

<p>My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn&#8217;t beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn&#8217;t finish the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was growing up, I really liked fighting games like /Street
Fighter/, but I was horrible at them, whether I played the
computer or another person. I decided earlier this year that I
would learn how to be good, so I bought Street Fighter IV and I
practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz
Street Fighter 4 FightStick Tournament Edition Arcade
stick. Heaven! It is so sweet to use for this game and some many
others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently bought Ikaruga for the Xbox 360. This game is
/amazing/. I can&#8217;t believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was
meant to be played.</p>

<p>The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I&#8217;m really impressed by
this game and can&#8217;t wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.</p>

<p>There are some amazing videos of it online: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y">level 3 (perfect)</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZEGyrEnXrk">1 player 2 player</a>. And <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-thinking-man-s-ikaruga-stop-and-smell-the-duality-60929.phtml">here&#8217;s a description of the story</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I&#8217;d actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn&#8217;t touched
it since.</p>

<p>I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.</p>

<p>There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the last little bit, I played and beat this for the
Nintendo GBA. This is definitely a good entry in the Castlevania
franchise. I really appreciated the variety that came from the
Soul system, but I felt like it had a problem that many RPGs with
these &#8220;collecting&#8221; systems: most of the things you collect are
totally useless. This game had two other problems in my mind:
first, the difficulty curve had a really sharp spike at one point
which required me to grind for almost two hours to get past a
boss; and second, the user interface was really poor and that
complicated switching souls quickly to navigate around the
map. Both of these were fixed in the next entry; in particular the
Doppelganger soul allowed you to have two equipment sets
readied.</p></p>

<p>I will definitely play this again as the secret character, so
maybe I&#8217;ll report back then.</p>
