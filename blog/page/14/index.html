  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he&#8217;d play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn&#8217;t have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn&#8217;t beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you&#8217;ve conquered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a fine little romance. The most interesting thing about it
is how this, and other movies (like the Chaplin biopic) rewrite the
history of the Communist/Hollywood controversy of the 50s to play
out the way that modern Hollywood people wish that it would. It
makes me think that maybe some people wouldn&#8217;t realize that
Hollywood didn&#8217;t really &#8220;win&#8221;. There&#8217;s a lot of Hollywood
dopey-eye-ism in the movie, actually. It reminds me a lot of
Hugo.</p>

<p>I think the movie might have been improved by making it more
ambiguous about whether Jim Carrey really lost his memory.</p>

<p>The reviews are interesting. I think Roger Ebert saw what it was
going for and believed in it. The speech at the end was a bit too
dopey for my taste.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My little sister wanted to watch this movie tonight, so we watched
it together. I thought it was very cool and pretty trippy. I don&#8217;t
think Johnny Depp was very good in it though&#8230; he was too much
like <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow, but looked really weird and had a funny
voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the
best, they were just so odd. It was cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the blend of Western and Sci-Fi style. I was glad
that the aliens had a sensible purpose for being on Earth. I liked
that there was a deeper world in the background, but that it was
not too tantalizing (for a movie like this.) I thought the aliens
looked cool and Daniel Craig was super tough. The juxtaposition,
though, was the best part. All-around a good time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had heard a little about this movie when it came out, but nothing
really special. My parents wanted to watch a movie together and I
saw this on Amazon and suggested it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the movie. It&#8217;s very much unlike anything else in
its grand scheme. Maybe a little bit like Stargate. It takes a
little while to get started, but once it does, the pay-off is
great. I think what I like most about it is the way it spins a
world so well.</p>

<p>It makes me very interested in reading the series of books.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My mom recommended this movie to us, as she has been reading the
series it is based on for a long time. I found the movie charming
and cute. It was a nice light mystery with some subtle romantic and
funny moments. It makes me interested in the books.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.</p>

<p>I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren&#8217;t
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She&#8217;s got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.</p>

<p>I quite like the development of Pete&#8217;s understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.</p>

<p>I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter&#8217;s
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like &#8220;This Means War&#8221;, in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don&#8217;t think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely &#8220;hot&#8221; lady, although she&#8217;s definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her &#8220;sexy&#8221; scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For about a month I&#8217;ve been working on 5-14X (Necrosis). It was
very, very hard. You had to go down a shaft, across a wide area
with tiny platforms, then up a shaft, back down, back across, back
up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.</p>

<p>Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, &#8220;Well, I think this should be the last try
before we go to church.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Okay! Let&#8217;s DO it!&#8221; Then, of
course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.</p>

<p>I got 38.00 seconds when the par time was 60.00 seconds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Katniss destroying the Holo was pretty stupid.</p>

<p>Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.</p>

<p>Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.</p>

<p>Snow&#8217;s conversation with Katniss: very believable.</p>

<p>Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.</p>
