  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m beginning to really like Starbuck&#8217;s personality and I like
the interrogation of the Cylon, because they are very interesting
characters. This was the first time I realized that it is a bit
unreasonable to only show Cylons we know of working together
(when they are by themselves) simply as a conceit to the fact
that viewers shouldn&#8217;t know who the other ones are. The trope of
a &#8220;shadowy council&#8221; probably won&#8217;t be as bad as this. I think it
is very interesting to speculate on the psyche and goals of the
Cylons, particularly with their psychological warfare like shown
in this episode. I was very intrigued by what would happen when
Gaius found out that Sharon was a Cylon&#8230; will he tell Adama
right away?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great episode. My favourite characters are Gaius and
Number Six, so I was glad that the whole episode was about
them&#8212;with a little bit in the background maintaing the other
plot threads. I&#8217;m excited for him to actually make progress on
the Cylon detector (slash) doing the will of Number Six. I&#8217;m also
really excited about studying the Raider.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very court-room drama style episode. I was most
interested in speculating about Gaius and what&#8217;s going on
Caprica. The stuff on Galactica was fine, but not the kind of
thing I&#8217;m really into. I feel like the disobedience of tribunal
will be forgotten, but if it won&#8217;t be, then this will be a
pivotal moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really liked this episode a lot. They did a great job showing
the nobility of the pilots in both fighting for their friend and
bowing to the moral pressure of the President. I thought it was
also amazing how Starbuck got the Cylon ship ready for flight and
marked it as well. I hope it will be really useful for them to
research the Cylons, both biologically and mechanically. I&#8217;m
excited about where this can go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was mostly about the character of Starbuck and her
demons. I don&#8217;t like her very much, so I wasn&#8217;t enthralled with
the episode, but I thought it was a little neat to learn about
the training regime. I&#8217;m glad that the pressure from the Cylons
is back on. I didn&#8217;t like how they try to make her a kind of
&#8220;sexual&#8221; character, because I think she&#8217;s really weird looking
and it doesn&#8217;t work very well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I liked how this episode made reference to the long and detailed
history of the pre-Cylon attack life, including major political
figures. Also, I enjoyed the principled attitude of Apollo. The
situation with Gaius is getting very complicated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was interesting, but it was the first &#8220;normal&#8221;
episode for me, rather than one that really blew me away. I
thought it was neat to imagine how Sharon didn&#8217;t even realize she
was a Cylon and could actually fight against it. It was also cool
to learn more about the logistics of the Fleet. I like that
seemingly trivial things like that can be the &#8220;enemy&#8221; in this
show. I&#8217;m also very curious where the stuff on Caprica will
go. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it can possibly be relevant because Karl
can&#8217;t ever get to where the Galactica is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like how tragic this show is. My favourite form of drama
is tragedy and I think one of the reasons is that I like it when
circumstances go as low as imaginable, but then people persevere
and are heroic. This episode had that in spades. I almost cried
at a few parts. I really enjoyed the joy at the new baby at the
end. The idea of the whiteboard where every human is tracked is
brilliant.</p>

<p>One thing I wonder about the world of the show is whether there
was a time when the Twelve Colonies did not know about each
other. Did they have a pre-radio technology era, or were they
colonized with advanced space technology and mostly stayed at
that complexity for a long time?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I liked a lot of things about this episode.</p>

<p>I really like the concept of Number Six being a character. The
awkwardness of Gaius being the only one who can see her is very
fun.</p>

<p>I think the Cylon&#8217;s perspective is fascinating. I liked listening
to the guy on the depot talk about how they were serving God by
punishing the Humans for their sins. I thought it was awesome at
the end of the episode how they said they had to find and kill
the Humans or else they would come back some day for revenge.</p>

<p>I thought the revelations about the Human religion and the idea
of the mythic Earth is really cool. It makes you feel like they
could be out there somewhere. The <em>REDACTED</em> connection is great
too. I loved what they said the first verse of the Sacred Scrolls
were: &#8220;Life here came from out there&#8221;. They know they are
colonists of somewhere, but don&#8217;t know where.</p>

<p>It is a fascinating world. I think that&#8217;s what I like about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We watched the first episode of Battlestar Galactica last
night. Actually the first part of the miniseries.</p>

<p>My favourite part was how clearly they communicated that most
people had no idea what the Cylons were like and have no fear of
them, but that the old guys who do are the best qualified to deal
with them. I really liked the realization, as the war started,
that almost all the soldiers were too young to have even ever
seen a Cylon, but were now responsible to deal with them.</p>

<p>Very cool so far, I&#8217;m excited about the show.</p>
