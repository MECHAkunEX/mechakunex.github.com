  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I&#8217;ll play it again unless I&#8217;m totally desperate. I&#8217;d rather
just read something on my phone. I don&#8217;t blame this game though, I
think it&#8217;s really the fault of the phone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game&#8230; how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It&#8217;s pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting&#8212;objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at a point in my life where it&#8217;s not worth it to read books
I&#8217;m not interested in, finish movies that I don&#8217;t love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren&#8217;t rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I&#8217;d like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I&#8217;ll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started on the July 12th and beat the main game on the 19th. I
continued playing the optional content until today. I did all the
extra &#8220;Search&#8221; missions, but I didn&#8217;t want to invest the time to
do every other mission to unlock the /Final/ mission. (So I
watched it on YouTube.) In the end, I cleared 86 missions in
36:22:53.</p>

<p>I thought the game was amazing. It&#8217;s beautiful and the controls
actually feel really nice (unlike Portable Ops, where the controls
were atrocious.) The story is really cool too. The main thing I
didn&#8217;t like about the game is how a lot of the extra content
revolved around incredibly difficult boss fights. (It was about
half that and half stealth missions&#8230; which were all really
fun.)</p>

<p>I thought the pace of unlocking new content was really nice. A big
problem with some games like this is that you feel drowned in the
number of possible options. This has a nice slow drip that feels
rewarding to unlock more. Eventually though, it became too much
for me when there were so many combat missions on the docket.</p>

<p>There were many funny in-jokes in the Metal Gear Universe that I
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the game though was the disgusting Che
worship. Ugh.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I have now played and beat every Metal Gear game that has been
released!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.</p>

<p>I was really excited when the game was announced, because
Castlevania games are basically perfect in my eyes. I was also
excited that it would be multiplayer, because I wanted to have
my wife play with me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as more information about the game came out, I was
pretty disappointed. You can&#8217;t play multiplayer in the same room
and it&#8217;s just the combat sub-system of the game, with a lot of the
progression stripped out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to get it and play it.</p>

<p>I played through the whole game with Alucard. I was originally
planning on playing through with all the characters, going through
the DLC characters and levels, etc&#8230; but after playing through
once I&#8217;m kind of non-plussed about doing that. I expect that it
will be more and more of the same with very little excitement.</p>

<p>While I won&#8217;t play more of it, I did enjoy what I played. It is
very difficult to play by yourself, because there are very few
benefits to grinding and it isn&#8217;t balanced for single player, but
it is very rewarding to conquer and master the boss patterns. In
particular, Death and Dracula each took me a few weeks to
beat. When I finally beat Dracula, I could only take one more hit
and I was in that state for a few minutes&#8230; miraculously dodging
everything. It was pretty rad.</p>

<p>I started the game in April and played about twice a week, then I
switched to playing every two days about two months ago.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.</p>

<p>It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons&#8212;although there are some clear winners overall.</p>

<p>My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can&#8217;t. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend it, but I probably won&#8217;t schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.</p>

<p>There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn&#8217;t check who you needed to
still visit.</p>

<p>All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)</p>

<p>First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard&#8212;the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no &#8220;Game Over if Spotted&#8221; mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.</p>

<p>After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:</p>

<p>Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I didn&#8217;t make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I&#8217;m proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that&#8217;s attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.</p>

<p>Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP</p>

<p>I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.</p>

<p>Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP</p>

<p>I think I bought a shotgun or something.</p>

<p>Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 64 (30 more)
Current Drebin Points: 153,021DP</p>

<p>At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.</p>

<p>Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 46 (15 more)
Alert Phases: 89 (8 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 81 (17 more)
Weapon Types Procured: 37
Flashbacks Watched: 214
Special Items Used: Not Used
Current Drebin Points: 332,947DP
Code Name: &#8220;Pigeon&#8221;
Other titles: Inchworm, Hyena, Pig, Leopard</p>

<p>I used more continues in the final stage than any other.</p>

<p>One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.</p>

<p>In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn&#8217;t grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn&#8217;t hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn&#8217;t get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)</p>

<p>In the story department, this game is a winner.</p>

<p>All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.</p>

<p>The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.</p>

<p>The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.</p>

<p>There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.</p>

<p>I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.</p>

<p>The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.</p>

<p>my wife&#8217;s comment: People&#8217;s butts in this game look weird.</p>

<p>In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone&#8217;s toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.</p>

<p>The credits music is beautiful.</p>

<p>It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Desktop Dungeons every few days for about two
months. I was able to get through the normal mode easily with the
Fighter and the advanced version of the Fighter, but I haven&#8217;t
been able to with any other classes&#8212;I&#8217;ve tried the next Fighter
and the Thief, mainly the Thief. I feel like the game&#8217;s random
creation engine is flawed and creates un-beatable dungeons. For
example, in the last one I did, I beat every enemy and was only
level 8, but the boss is always level 10 and indestructible. I&#8217;ve
decided to stop playing because of this&#8230; I gave it many chances,
but every play session is becoming too rote. Initially, I thought
it was very cool because it flet like a roguelike, but was very
bite-sized. I think the idea is still good, but needs to be
refined.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the Metal Gear Solid 2: Digital Graphic Novel. It was
really cool. The changed the flow of the story a lot and a lot of
the details for the adventure, but it got to the same place. It
was neat, and a good reminder before playing MGS4 (which I am
doing right now.)</p>
