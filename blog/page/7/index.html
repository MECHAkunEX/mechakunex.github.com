  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a neat episode. It was basically just character
development for the Cylons, but it was very neat. I think the most
meaningful thing was about the disappointment of the One and his
role as a leader from the very beginning. Cool. There were no new
plot or mythology revelations, but it was neat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The flashbacks are interesting, but I wonder how they can
relevant. I don&#8217;t feel like they answer big questions about the
characters, they just seem to be elaborating some of the
characters we already know about them. Even Gaius/Caprica and
Laura&#8217;s things tell us new things about them, but we already
believed those characters traits. I&#8217;m kind of surprised that
Gaius would really go with Galactica and I still wonder what he
could do there. How will the story resolve what the deal is with
his &#8220;destiny&#8221; and his &#8220;angel&#8221;? I&#8217;m glad that Boomer is trying to
help Hera (even though she got her into the mess in the first
place.)  It was funny how the black guy said, &#8220;It looks like it
was wrong to trust her&#8221; and Cavil, ever the machine, says &#8220;No, it
was just a miscalculation.&#8221; It was really cool to see the humans
fighting alongside Centurions (you wonder how they explained the
problem to them); and it was also neat to see the old Centurions
on the colony. I&#8217;m still not sure how they&#8217;ll be able to fully
resolve the story. In my mind, they need (a) rescue Hera, (b)
destroy the Cylon threat, (c) find a place to live, and (d)
briefly explain how future integration will occur. Right now,
they are on track to (a) and I can imagine they&#8217;ll be able to (b)
by destroying the colony, or something. But what&#8217;ll happen with
(c) and (d)&#8230; or the other un-answered questions?</p>

<p>Well, the solution they came up with was pretty awesome. I find a
little hard to believe that they could convince everyone to put
down their technology, but it is a good solution. The connection
to real history is really cool too. It was super epic how Kara
came up with the jump coordinates and how she was really an angel
or something. Part of me wishes that they would go into more
detail with Gaius&#8217; cult, God, how the 13th (Cylon) colony was
attacked, etc, but another part of me thinks that they couldn&#8217;t
do it in a non-absurd way. By the way, I found the truce from
Cavil to be very believable and I think he would have been
trustworthy. I didn&#8217;t expect Tyril to be such a punk. What an
awesome show.</p>

<p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/03/you_will_know_t.html">Bryan Caplan</a> was very upset with the finale. He finds it really
unbelievable. I agree. But I think that the conclusion was safe,
in the sense that it resolved the core conflict in a meaningful
way. A few commentators make the point that it is the only way to
connect the Colonists with our past. One person on his site says
that the whole story is like a re-telling of the Flood: God is
sick of the wickness, so He destroys almost everyone and starts
over with a group of flawed people (Adama = Noah = weak to
drink). Another comment talks about how cool it would be if the
arrived in modern times and it dealt with how crazy we would feel
about them. The same guy says that they could have crash landed
to remove their equipment, rather than voluntary losing it. Re:
Kara leads people to their doom, might mean the destruction of
technology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very interesting episode. I can&#8217;t believe how terrible
Boomer is. Athena seems like she&#8217;s in so much pain. I love the
little insight into Gaius&#8217; operation. There&#8217;s now only one show
left, I have no idea how they can close it up. <em>REDACTED</em> thinks they
have to back and live on New Caprica, because that&#8217;s the only
habitable place they know. Could Hera do something that will
drastically improve the situation from the Cylon Colony? What
will it be like when the Cylon Basestar is the military HQ? It&#8217;s
intense.</p>

deep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml">Destructoid</a> - I like the review.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/">Edge</a> - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won&#8217;t get
you that.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php">Christian Nutt in Gamasutra</a> - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn&#8217;t need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;ve beat the game and 100%&#8217;d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect&#8212;there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor&#8212;a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.</p>

<p>FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem&#8212;the UI is much better in ways you wouldn&#8217;t
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun &amp; diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
&#8220;mechanics&#8221;, much better, in fact.</p>

<p>There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the &#8220;drive&#8221; of the
characters&#8212;escape&#8212;consumes all story bandwidth.</p>

<p>But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn&#8217;t even re-use every environment and there didn&#8217;t seem to
be very much from the &#8220;whole game of content&#8221; that was cut
from 13.</p>

<p>However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don&#8217;t think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn&#8217;t feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.</p>

<p>This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn&#8217;t pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content&#8212;the super hard bosses, like FF13&#8217;s missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.</p>

<p>In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13&#8217;s 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.</p>

<p>Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope&#8212;other than To Be Continued&#8212;that would&#8217;ve
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I&#8217;d hope for a bit more
improvements.</p>

<p>I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, Boomer is a low down good fer nothin&#8217;. I totally predicted
that Kara&#8217;s piano playing friend was her dad and that he wasn&#8217;t
real. Given that he played that song, it makes me wonder if like
her dad was the only living &#8220;Daniel&#8221; Cylon&#8212;you know, the
artist. Because if he doesn&#8217;t enter the plot in some way, why
would they tell us about him in the first place, given that it
wasn&#8217;t really that informative about something else. (Maybe just
that Cavil is a punk.) Also, at the beginning of this episode I
was thinking about how Cavil has been missing most of the season,
at least since the hub was destroyed, and that he doesn&#8217;t really
have plans that they are getting involved in. There&#8217;s only two
episodes left!</p>
