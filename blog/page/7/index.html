  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a CRAZY episode. The whole plot line is pretty cool and
exciting, but I kind of wish there was more in it. For example,
Holmes doesn&#8217;t defend himself at all, but it would great for him
to do so. I loved that he was in contempt of court, but we don&#8217;t
know what he said. There were lots of clever moments like that. I
loved the way Moriarty explained that social engineering is more
effective than hacking. I thought the ending was far too obvious,
especially with regard to Holmes enlisting Molly&#8217;s help. In that
respect it is obvious, but on the other hand it is ridiculous
that there&#8217;s going to be an explanation for how he survived,
tricked the people at morgue (presumably Molly just did it?),
etc. I&#8217;m a bit pessimistic about where the show will go from
here. The ending is so &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; in its incredulity,
that I could imagine Moriarty not really being dead too. The show
has upped the stakes so much, it seems like they can&#8217;t really go
back to pedestrian plots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very interesting episode. I liked that it was a
&#8220;monster of the week&#8221; kind of episode and not an episode about
the epic story. It was neat that the interpersonal story of
James and Sherlock was explored so much as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for almost three hours and beat the game. I beat
levels 6, 7, and 8 as Maria. Then, I beat 8 as Richter. Then I
beat 4&#8217; as Richter to get to 5&#8217;. I did 5&#8217; as Maria (and continued
on to beat the game on the same continue.)</p>

<p>When I finally beat Dracula as Richter, I wasn&#8217;t hit at all in his
human form, but was hit just once in his giant man-bat form (by
the blue energy wave, that I think you are supposed to duck
under.)</p>

<p>This is a very satisfying game to beat. I will definitely
continue playing it in the future&#8230; especially since I invested
in a PC Engine to be able to play it. It&#8217;s a blast.</p>

<p>Although&#8230; I&#8217;m annoyed that I only have 96% completion on the
save screen&#8230; despite having done everything in the game. I&#8217;m not
sure what I&#8217;m supposed to do to bring it to 100%.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they&#8217;re texting, there&#8217;s
the six months she&#8217;s pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she&#8217;s actually dead, etc. It&#8217;s a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson&#8217;s girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he&#8217;d be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I&#8217;ll be very annoyed that there won&#8217;t be
any closure in the sixth episode.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about 20 minutes tonight. I used the X-RGB with the
Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can&#8217;t wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a cute movie with a pretty unique plot. The main girl was
cute and wholesome. I feel like the ending was a bit empty though,
because other than going to AA there was no explanation of how
Arthur changed. Th end of the movie suggested that Arthur&#8217;s only
problem was that he drank a lot (and perhaps having so many
resources exacerbated the impact of that), but didn&#8217;t deal at all
with his lack of knowledge, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the morning, we played for about a half hour and beat level 4&#8217;
via the secret route&#8212;beating Camilla&#8212;but not getting to 5&#8217;. I
started on stage 5 a bit, but was pretty beat down.</p>

<p>Later, I played for about an hour and a half and beat
stage 5. Eventually I was able to use the watch to get through up
to Death without getting hit at all&#8230; by pausing the action just
before the large green monsters. Sometimes this game seems totally
impossible and brutalizing. The key seems to always be using the
sub-weapons effectively and breaking the challenges. Or, learning
pitch perfect timing and getting through unscathed&#8230; but mostly
doing the sub-weapons just right. It&#8217;s a fascinating design.</p>

<p>After I mastered that, it took about 7 tries to kill Death. I
stuck with the Cross. I used an Item Crash early and pummeled
him. I dodged the huge skulls by staying to the left and
right. The melee fight was pure stick-and-move. It is so
satisfying to win at this game.</p>

<p>After Death was dead, I fought the Vampire Bat and was killed
Medusa in the Boss rush stage. I decided to go back and fight
Camilla again, because supposedly you need to beat Death to get
the secret exit&#8230; but no luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really fascinating episode. I liked how there were
some many subplots and little stories. I think the Moriarty
character is really cool, but I thought the actor wasn&#8217;t a good
choice. I expected someone older and more menacing
looking. Instead, this guy looks like an angry bully
kid. Hopefully as we see him more, he&#8217;ll look more the part.</p>
