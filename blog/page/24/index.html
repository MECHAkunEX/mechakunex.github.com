  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.</p>

<p>Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn&#8217;t
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I will play it again, but I&#8217;ll move on to the next game for
now. I&#8217;ve realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I&#8217;ll play through it
right then, otherwise I&#8217;ll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the &#8220;play in
the future&#8221; list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to play Ikari Warriors on my Famicom. I wanted to play it
because I&#8217;ve heard it talked about some many times. But it was
excruciatingly slow. I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was the fault of my
PowerPak or the normal behavior, but when I looked at videos
online, it didn&#8217;t seem like it was normally faster. It reminded me
a little bit of Iron Tank, which I remember liking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is another game that I got with my Famicom for free. This is
a very intriguing game. It feels like a mix of the original
Castlevania games with the multiple area/free-form system of Order
of Ecclesia. After playing it for about 30 minutes, I put down in
my database that I&#8217;d like to try it again. The mechanics are
strong enough, although there seem to be a bit too many annoying
sinusoidal enemies. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.</p>

<p>Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.</p>

<p>This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest&#8230; some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can&#8217;t comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago I played Milon&#8217;s Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game&#8230; which is
otherwise really opaque.</p>

<p>The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn&#8217;t love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I&#8217;d have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don&#8217;t totally love the mechanics and I can&#8217;t save in between
play sessions, so I&#8217;d have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I&#8217;d seen enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.</p>

<p>This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I&#8217;m glad I
played it.</p>

<p>Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon&#8217;s
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.</p>

<p>In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.</p>

<p>I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn&#8217;t love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell&#8230; a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Yie Ar Kung-Fu for my Famicom tonight. I got it when I
bought the Famicom and I read that it was one of the first
fighting games.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy&#8217;s skull and it doesn&#8217;t register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.</p>

<p>But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.</p>

<p>However, other than number 9, I&#8217;ve never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.</p>
