  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d never read Jane Eyre before, but didn&#8217;t have very big
expectations for this movie. It was very well done and pretty
fascinating. I found the story to go very slowly and have a really
unpredictable structure. I expected to learn more about the
boarding school, but did not. I expected to learn more about her
job after meeting the Rivers, but did not. It seemed like it was
going to be a horror story before the old wife is revealed. After
getting through my expectations, it was very enjoyable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I&#8217;ve
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game&#8230; they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she&#8217;d be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said &#8220;until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die&#8221; instead of
&#8220;until death do you part&#8221;&#8230; thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I made a lot of progress and saved the kingdom. It was
fun. I started exploring the new continent. I had a really hard
time with fighting the giant cat. I could tell there was some
trick but couldn&#8217;t tell what it would be. It was annoying to have
no clue. I played for like two hours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like three hours today at various times. I got
through the next few adventures and now I&#8217;ve escaped from the
slave camp and I&#8217;m trying to get Coburg back in order. I really
enjoy the story in this Dragon Quest. It does a really good job of
making you feel like your dad is really strong and cares about
you. It&#8217;s neat. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of cute foreshadowing
going on too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like the setup of the story: being a kid, hanging out
with your dad, etc. It&#8217;s very adorable and heart-warming. I
especially like all the little jokes about how he can&#8217;t read. The
game-play is exactly what you&#8217;d expect and fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason I had lower expectations for this movie than recent
super hero movies I&#8217;ve seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning&#8230; like when he jumped on the grenade&#8230; and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn&#8217;t really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I&#8217;m excited to see The Avengers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend&#8217;s commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too&#8230; like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning&#8230; it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The stupidity continues: (pg 188) [The context is that the pioneers
don&#8217;t often win in technology.] &#8220;Palm Computing did not pioneer the
personal digital assistant; Apple did&#8221; (and clearly Palm has won in
that industry.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how &#8220;smart&#8221; the &#8220;great&#8221;
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can&#8217;t
really go into that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they&#8217;ve been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) &#8220;We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we&#8217;ve
uncovered.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren&#8217;t &#8220;conscientious&#8221; enough and even then
they say &#8220;almost any&#8221; and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don&#8217;t make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the &#8220;companies&#8221; we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a &#8220;Great&#8221;
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a &#8220;humble&#8221; leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>
