  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I&#8217;d comment on it more than my original post.</p>

<p>I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it&#8217;s a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to express what I like about it. There&#8217;s so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I&#8217;ve been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I&#8217;ll get better though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn&#8217;t mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an &#8220;arranged&#8221; soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version. This seems to me &#8220;edited&#8221; or
&#8220;variant&#8221;, although in most cases the &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don&#8217;t really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.</p>

<p>However, I definitely don&#8217;t like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles&#8217; music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.</p>

<p>As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I&#8217;ve gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I&#8217;m starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post about Ikaruga, I&#8217;ve continued my daily
training. I&#8217;ve made a few new accomplishments:
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.</em> I&#8217;ve been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here&#8217;s a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I&#8217;ve had a 12 chain
stretch and I&#8217;m on a 14 chain stretch. If I&#8217;m imbalanced because
I didn&#8217;t have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I&#8217;ve been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I&#8217;ll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it&#8217;s time for the boss and I&#8217;ve got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it&#8217;s that important, but I&#8217;d like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.</em> This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn&#8217;t say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I&#8217;m a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn&#8217;t get hit once (which is good
because I didn&#8217;t have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I still love this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five &#8220;acts&#8221; of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.</p>

<p>I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.</p>

<p>Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don&#8217;t invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you&#8217;ll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.</p>

<p>The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you&#8217;d want
to buy, so it just accumulates.</p>

<p>The story is interesting but there isn&#8217;t anything too special
about it.</p>

<p>The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn&#8217;t I quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I&#8217;ve decided to stop
playing because I&#8217;ve been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great: it&#8217;s a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
&#8220;catch-them-all&#8221; with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can &#8220;crack&#8221;.</p>

<p>The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn&#8217;t
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn&#8217;t realize that you could
change a character&#8217;s skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn&#8217;t the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.</p>

<p>However, there are a few key points where if you&#8217;ve done every
single battle before them and you&#8217;ve cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won&#8217;t be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played through most of Retro Game
Challenge and just completed the last challenge (beat all the
games) tonight. This game is incredibly brilliant.</p>

<p>The premise is that a demon version of a Japanese video game
playing TV star has sent you back into the 80s to challenge you
with old Famicom-style video games. You are presented with a game
and four challenges, when you complete most challenges you get a
new issue of a game magazine and when you complete all of them you
get another game and more challenges. Each game has an illustrated
manual. The game magazines are hilarious, because they will
preview games that you&#8217;ll be unlocking soon, they&#8217;ll report that a
game has been delayed, and they have a top 5 chart with hilarious
parody titles. When you play a game, it runs in to the top screen
of the DS, while on the bottom you see two kids sitting in front
of a TV playing. I love that the friend makes comments about how
you&#8217;re playing as you do. It is hilarious.</p>

<p>The games are great too:
- <em>Cosmic Gate</em> - This is a Galaga-like fixed-screen shooter. It
is simple, but fun.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man</em> - This is a single screen platformer,
like Bubble Bobble, although you throw ninja stars to stun
things. The main mechanic is going in &#8220;doors&#8221; that hurt the
enemies and protect you from damage. This isn&#8217;t my favourite
game, but it is enjoyable.
- <em>Rally King</em> - A racing game like RC Pro Am. The cool part is
the drift mechanic. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of racers, so when I beat
this game for the final challenge I used invincibility.
- <em>Star Prince</em> - A straight-forward vertically scrolling
shooter. The weapon selection is great and the hidden bonus
items are fun to find. You get a special controller to play this
game which turns your Y button into a rapid-fire. One of my
favourite subtleties is that you fire faster the closer you are
to the top of the screen (which is dangerous.)
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2</em> - This game plays just like its
predecessor, although it is considerably more difficult and the
final boss is very interesting.
- <em>Rally King SP</em> - The same game as its predecessor but with new
graphics. The levels are the same, etc. This is a promotional
game for the game magazine and a soup company. Very funny.
- <em>Guadia Quest</em> - A Dragon Quest-style JRPG. A fun mechanic is
that you can capture strong enemies and they will fight for
you. It was very fun to play this old school RPG.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3</em> - This is a reboot of the Robot Ninja
Haggle Man series with new graphics and gameplay. The gameplay
and graphics are incredibly reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden,
although the colors pop a lot more than the original NES Ninja
Gaidens. In addition to that core gameplay, there is a
customization system reminiscent of Super Metroid. This is a
little bit of exploration as well, but the levels are mostly
linear.</p>

<p>My favourite games were Star Prince, Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3, and
Guadia Quest.</p>

<p>I /highly/ recommend this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood&#8217;s Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch&#8212;you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don&#8217;t really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn&#8217;t actually
feel like a shooting game.</p>

<p>This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I&#8217;ve managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I&#8217;ve beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I&#8217;ve begun to appreciate them less. I
don&#8217;t find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I&#8217;d rather just play the game itself. Since I don&#8217;t plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.</p>

<p>It was fun C. Viper. I&#8217;ll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just finished Ninja Gaiden for the NES. It was great to use
an authentic controller for it. It was also great to be able to
use save states because the game is so hard.</p>

<p>I really like the simple and straight-forward controls. I love
the arcade/shmup-like patterns and difficulties. Even though with
modern games, I loathe lame cut-scenes over boring stories, I find
them really entertaining in this game, because they are so
simplistic. The music and sound-effects overall are nice, in that
8-bit way.</p>

<p>For the first four acts (there are six), I limited myself to
one save state per screen. This was a significant challenge. When
I got to the fifth act, it was so tough that I was tempted by the
save states and used them after each obstacle. Each of the final
bosses (there are three) was defeated by using a save after each
hit I landed. Nevertheless, I feel very satisfied that I have been
able to get through the game, because even severely disadvantaging
it, it was very hard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to playing the sequel. If I play it again,
I will use save states much less to force myself to gain more
skill at the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through The Legend of Zelda: The
Minish Cap. I knew I was almost done, so I stayed up a little too
late finish it tonight.</p>

<p>The graphics in this game are beautiful and vibrant. Many games
these days are dark and muddy, so it is refreshing to have such a
bright game. The game has the same style as /Link to the Past/,
but with a bit more cudly-ness.</p>

<p>The sound is good. I caught my wife humming a few of the
tunes.</p>

<p>The story is a respectable Zelda story. I like that the title
is a double entendre.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very good. It has the same core mechanics as
the first Zelda and /Link to the Past/ (my two
favourite), but almost all the items are brand new. The Kinstone
system (wherein you collect trinkets and give them to particular
NPCs) is a nice abstraction of a quest mechanic, although I
would&#8217;ve liked to have been able to get to the bonuses without
using a Kinstone, somehow. The boss fights are very fun and
difficult enough&#8212;I had to repeat two of them and the final
boss&#8217;s first form got me the first time. The dungeon designs are
good. The puzzles are interesting without being infuriating. I
only had a few times where I wanted to throw the control (all in
the Wind Palace, btw.) The world is big enough to make it
interesting and the teleport system is convenient.</p>

<p>I finished the game with 14 heart containers, two bottles,
without the boomerang, with the original shield, without any bomb
bag/quiver upgrades (actually I&#8217;m not sure if there are any) and
with all the sword techniques. It was a little hard to complete
with such a small amount of life and only two bottles, but it was
obviously do-able and fun.</p>

<p>I definitely still prefer /Link to the Past/, but
this is worth playing again and thus worth playing for the first
time too.</p>
