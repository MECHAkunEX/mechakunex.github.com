  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, &#8220;Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?&#8221; He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn&#8217;t move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

<p>We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The kids and I played this for a bit today. We did Needle Man and
couldn&#8217;t do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn&#8217;t get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie was suggested by Netflix and I wasn&#8217;t sure I would like
it. As we watched it, it was pretty cute and touching. It was very
reminiscent of how my wife and I were when we first met&#8230; fell in
love over the course of 10 days and then didn&#8217;t see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years
and years past&#8230; it was a very depressing and unhappy ending.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren&#8217;t totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren&#8217;t really
super heroes&#8230; more &#8220;super spys&#8221; and that didn&#8217;t seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character&#8230; the actor played him too &#8220;cool&#8221; and above-it-all.</p>

<p>There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, there&#8217;s only one God, and I don&#8217;t
think He dresses like that.&#8221; Not only was it delivered really well,
but it&#8217;s such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I&#8217;m surprised
that in this episode they didn&#8217;t show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rally girl&#8221; thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn&#8217;t playing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife has been wanting to watch this show for a while, based on
the recommendation of her good friend. I can&#8217;t think of that many
things that I care less about than football, so I&#8217;ve been
dragging my feet about watching it.</p>

<p>I found the first episode to be interesting. It is very
predictable in the plot development. The characters mostly play
to type, but they have a very real quality to them&#8230; like they
could be real people out there in a world that I know nothing
about (Texas, and Football.)</p>

<p>I really like the movie Varsity Blues and this is very
reminiscent of it. The small-town quaintness is cute and it is
interesting to learn about something I know nothing about.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed that no character in the show expressed
the idea that Jason&#8217;s sacrifice was not worth it and that one
game or football itself is not worth ruining your life
over. Hopefully that will come up later.</p>

<p>I very much like the amount of faith in the show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d never read Jane Eyre before, but didn&#8217;t have very big
expectations for this movie. It was very well done and pretty
fascinating. I found the story to go very slowly and have a really
unpredictable structure. I expected to learn more about the
boarding school, but did not. I expected to learn more about her
job after meeting the Rivers, but did not. It seemed like it was
going to be a horror story before the old wife is revealed. After
getting through my expectations, it was very enjoyable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I&#8217;ve
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game&#8230; they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she&#8217;d be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said &#8220;until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die&#8221; instead of
&#8220;until death do you part&#8221;&#8230; thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I made a lot of progress and saved the kingdom. It was
fun. I started exploring the new continent. I had a really hard
time with fighting the giant cat. I could tell there was some
trick but couldn&#8217;t tell what it would be. It was annoying to have
no clue. I played for like two hours.</p>
