  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool &#8220;abilitease&#8221;. I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I&#8217;ve
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn&#8217;t realize it. But
now, it&#8217;s quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It&#8217;s cute so far though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn&#8217;t
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn&#8217;t (Craig&#8217;s conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts&#8217; character was very cute,
although we don&#8217;t learn anything about her, other than that she&#8217;s
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don&#8217;t really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to think of this movie before seeing it, but
I&#8217;d heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very
bad for the guy&#8230; it must have been hard to grow up like that and
to be used to so badly your whole life&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we played for about an hour and a half. I beat three of the
Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can&#8217;t dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a &#8220;bullet&#8221; is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn&#8217;t get
passed the title screen&#8230; it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played again, at the request of my kids, and beat Mr. Sandman in
about three matches! The time I won, I didn&#8217;t get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played two times today. The first time for about 45 minutes and
I got to Stage 9. I found it incredibly difficult to get past the
bone pillars&#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.</p>

<p>I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don&#8217;t like
that I can&#8217;t restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad&#8230; my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cool movie. The effects were awesome and the
embellishments of the story, particularly the relationship of the
Evil Queen and her brother, were really cool. Kristen Stewart was
beautiful in it and played the part very well. I thought she was
awkward fighting, but feel like it was purposeful. Definitely a
fun movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man&#8217;s
stage. She killed a penguin! She&#8217;s getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time&#8230; something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn&#8217;t have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>
