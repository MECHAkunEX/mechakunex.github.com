  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like two hours today. I fought and won against
Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen&#8217;s Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I&#8217;m supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.</p>

<p>I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She&#8217;s a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That&#8217;s important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said &#8220;Amazing chest ahead&#8221;. It&#8217;s so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.</p>

<p>After failing utterly fighting her <em>and</em> realizing I hadn&#8217;t
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn&#8217;t buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.</p>

<p>I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn&#8217;t
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.</p>

<p>So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I&#8217;d get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.)</p>

<p>After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.</p>

<p>I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.</p>

<p>With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds&#8212;first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit <em>real</em> hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.</p>

<p>So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I&#8217;ll have to
perfect it later.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Explore the Blighttown - Swamp more
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie and the other ones were
pretty bad. I think their biggest failure was being too fantasy and
with too many monsters, etc. This movie doesn&#8217;t have that problem,
but it is definitely not as good as previous ones.</p>

<p>There are some fun moments of <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow being <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow. A
few absurd fights and chases. It&#8217;s a fairly fun and crazy movie.
The mermaids are totally beautiful and the mermaid who serves as
the love interest has a very sweet and innocent feel to her.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about a lot of the movie, it is pretty absurd
and silly, but I&#8217;m not sure I should really expect anything
different. It&#8217;s a solid B+. I think with a few more exciting fights
and a bit more plot coherence it could have been an A-.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I spent the time
working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I
would get repeatedly pummeled by the huge ghouls and then I kept
falling off and getting swarmed closer to the swamp. It was pretty
rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.</p>

<p>Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls&#8230; about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon&#8217;s Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can&#8217;t get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It&#8217;s kind of frustrating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn&#8217;t recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn&#8217;t skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.</p>

<p>I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I&#8217;m getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That&#8217;ll be nice to experiment with.</p>

really, really hard. Brutally hard. Especially the one where you
couldn&#8217;t build any new units. It was rough. This game has a really
good difficulty management system&#8230; in the beginning it is pretty
tough, but do-able and then near the middle to end it is insane,
but it&#8217;s all the same rules. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
