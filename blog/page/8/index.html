  <div class="entry-content"><p>My little sister wanted to watch this movie tonight, so we watched
it together. I thought it was very cool and pretty trippy. I don&#8217;t
think Johnny Depp was very good in it though&#8230; he was too much
like <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow, but looked really weird and had a funny
voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the
best, they were just so odd. It was cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the blend of Western and Sci-Fi style. I was glad
that the aliens had a sensible purpose for being on Earth. I liked
that there was a deeper world in the background, but that it was
not too tantalizing (for a movie like this.) I thought the aliens
looked cool and Daniel Craig was super tough. The juxtaposition,
though, was the best part. All-around a good time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had heard a little about this movie when it came out, but nothing
really special. My parents wanted to watch a movie together and I
saw this on Amazon and suggested it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the movie. It&#8217;s very much unlike anything else in
its grand scheme. Maybe a little bit like Stargate. It takes a
little while to get started, but once it does, the pay-off is
great. I think what I like most about it is the way it spins a
world so well.</p>

<p>It makes me very interested in reading the series of books.</p>

series it is based on for a long time. I found the movie charming
and cute. It was a nice light mystery with some subtle romantic and
funny moments. It makes me interested in the books.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.</p>

<p>I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren&#8217;t
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She&#8217;s got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.</p>

<p>I quite like the development of Pete&#8217;s understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.</p>

<p>I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter&#8217;s
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like &#8220;This Means War&#8221;, in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don&#8217;t think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely &#8220;hot&#8221; lady, although she&#8217;s definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her &#8220;sexy&#8221; scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For about a month I&#8217;ve been working on 5-14X (Necrosis). It was
very, very hard. You had to go down a shaft, across a wide area
with tiny platforms, then up a shaft, back down, back across, back
up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.</p>

<p>Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, &#8220;Well, I think this should be the last try
before we go to church.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Okay! Let&#8217;s DO it!&#8221; Then, of
course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.</p>

<p>I got 38.00 seconds when the par time was 60.00 seconds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Katniss destroying the Holo was pretty stupid.</p>

<p>Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.</p>

<p>Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.</p>

<p>Snow&#8217;s conversation with Katniss: very believable.</p>

<p>Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I played for a little less than three hours and finished
the game. I went through the Catacombs and then to the final
boss. I beat the Pinwheel boss and Nito on my first try. After I
got back to the Firelink Shrine, it took me a long time to figure
out that I just needed to jump down the pit to get back to the
Lordvessel. I did it the first time very nervously. I fought the
boss once and got creamed, then did a few of the upgrades I could
on my gear and then went back and beat him on my second try. After
I watched the ending, I had a big&#8230; that was it? Just explode
into the flame?</p>

<p>&#8211; Review &#8211;</p>

<p>This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It&#8217;s exactly like Demon&#8217;s Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon&#8217;s Souls.</p>

<p>I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could&#8217;ve been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren&#8217;t a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.</p>

<p>The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I&#8217;m undead, there&#8217;s a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don&#8217;t really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls story was very
coherent.</p>

<p>The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it&#8217;s all interconnected. It&#8217;s very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly &#8220;level&#8221;-y.</p>

<p>I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon&#8217;s. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don&#8217;t
think it really evolved that much.</p>

<p>The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn&#8217;t even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last&#8230; maybe I
just found a better farming spot.</p>

<p>The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon&#8217;s, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don&#8217;t really find the
game that difficult&#8230; just a good challenge&#8230; like Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon&#8217;s. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks&#8212;about the same
amount of total days, I think.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the game. But, I won&#8217;t be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I&#8217;d really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.</p>

<p>The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.</p>

<p>The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I&#8217;m glad that the characters realize this
too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny because when she&#8217;s in the field, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.</p>

<p>The real moment of Katniss&#8217; catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.</p>

<p>The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.</p>

<p>I find the term &#8220;Mockingjay&#8221; used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)</p>

<p>I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol&#8230; tense!</p>
