  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus, which I thought was
a Director&#8217;s Cut-style version of MGS:PO, but is actually a
totally different game mode; so I pretty quickly put it down and
got MGS:PO instead. I&#8217;m still playing that now and like it so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. It isn&#8217;t a
game, but it is on the PSP. It&#8217;s a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn&#8217;t give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.</p>

<p>I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis&#8217; abilities to
the form, because you can&#8217;t really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in watching the second graphic novel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After loving Metal Gear Acid so much, I played Metal Gear
Acid 2.</p>

<p>The opening movie of this was amazing.</p>

<p>The gameplay makes the last game feel like the first Dragon Quest:
there are so many ways the new interface is cleaner, easier, more
fluid, etc. I really like the improvements. The new gameplay
mechanics (like linkages and cover fire) where interesting, but
didn&#8217;t really make it different. But I&#8217;m fine with that, because I
just wanted more game. (The blinding mechanic was definitely new,
but very annoying.)</p>

<p>The game gives you cards in a different order from the last game
and I generally felt the weapon power-level was higher initially,
although the support cards had the same path.</p>

<p>I really liked the cell-shaded style of the 3D graphics.</p>

<p>The game does an absurd jiggling animation with the female
characters. It is ridiculous.</p>

<p>This game seems even more combat focused than the last
game. Whereas in the last game, there were many traversal levels
where combat was the best approach, in this game there are many
straight-out combat missions. This game also feels like it has a
lot less time in between boss encounters. I also noticed that
there weren&#8217;t really any &#8220;puzzle&#8221; levels, like before.</p>

<p>One thing that was close to a puzzle was the train level. It was
really cool to coax enemies into the path of the train and get
them squashed. Woo!</p>

<p>I did a little bit of grinding to get good cards, but I also made
some really stupid decks to get through some levels with a
challenge; both were fun.</p>

<p>The ending was very neat in its cinematic-ness, but the game in
general (and the bosses in particular) was a lot easier.</p>

<p>This game probably has more replay value because of the special
missions, but I didn&#8217;t do any.</p>

<p>Here are my final stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play Time: 14:24:20
Cost: 4395
Found: 45
Kills: 73
Total Damage: 15035
Clear Count: 1
Cards Collected: 41 (I don&#8217;t know what this means&#8230; maybe in the stages?)</p>

<p>I hope there will be an Acid 3.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.</p>

<p>This game is utterly insane in concept. It is a turn-based
tactical game based on the Metal Gear world, with collectible card
game elements. You need to read the Wikipedia page&#8217;s (linked
above) gameplay discussion to possibly understand how it
works. After playing it through, it is brilliant. I can&#8217;t believe
how great it is.</p>

<p>I love the gameplay. It is so deep. The final battle is
particularly epic.</p>

<p>The art is beautiful. There is some great 2D art, in addition to
the cool 3D in the game, but the 2D is definitely a lot better.</p>

<p>The story and characters are great and really &#8220;fit&#8221; in the Metal
Gear universe, even though it is a gaiden.</p>

<p>One of my favourite things in retrospect was the opening movie
that was an &#8220;action&#8221; video, but using the card-mechanics of the
whole game, so it felt really awkward and off-kilter, but in an
endearing way.</p>

<p>I found that the stealth-gameplay was pretty weak and it was
really optimized for combat, but I think that&#8217;s appropriate for
the gameplay since that&#8217;s where it really shines.</p>

<p>I think it would have a lot of replay value, although I never
played any level again, although I definitely died a lot and had
to make many attempts on some levels. In all, the game took me
19:55:01 on Normal difficulty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Persona 3 again. This time I played a female character
named Buffy Summers. That was the best part. I maxed all the
social links with a walkthrough and got all the remaining Personas
(there were five more I needed.) I just played 30 minutes a day
and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies
except bosses, because my MC was soooo powerful. Overall, it
wasn&#8217;t as good as the first time. I can&#8217;t tell if it is because
I&#8217;d done it before, or because being a girl wasn&#8217;t as exciting. I
can&#8217;t really get excited about wooing boys. :) There are
definitely some good jokes if you know what happens to the guy.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence over three days
from the 28th to the 30th. My stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play time: 19:14:20
Save: 12 times
Continue: 18 times
Alert Phase: 51 times
Humans Killed: 97 people
Seriously Injured: 129 times
Total Damage: 29 life bars.
Life Medicine Used: 0 times.
Plants &amp; Animals Captured: 11 kinds
Meals Eaten: 28 meals
Special Item: Not used
Title: Iguana</p>

<p>I have a lot of good things to say about this game, but I have a
few bad things and comments on the above stats.</p>

<p>First, I didn&#8217;t use any life medicine, because I never realized
what it did. I guess it was like a traditional ration from the
earlier games. I&#8217;m not sure how I missed the instructions that
they did that, but I totally ignored them the whole game. It
probably would&#8217;ve made a few things easier if I hadn&#8217;t. D&#8217;oh!</p>

<p>Next, I played on Normal, because there was no &#8220;Game Over if
Spotted&#8221; on any mode except European Extreme, which I don&#8217;t have
the fortitude for. This made me really mad, because I find the
game mechanically weak unless you have to sneak, but implementing
that mode yourself with saves, reloads, etc is waaay to tedious to
actually do. As such, I think my enjoyment of the game suffered a
lot. I don&#8217;t think I can think of any areas of the game that I got
through without alerting the guards. That means that I tried to
sneak, failed, and just ran past them frantically until I got to
the next cut-scene (which stopped the alert) or found somewhere to
hide, but then I&#8217;d just do it again. Thus, the game was basically
totally broken for me. The only mechanics I really did were the
combat mechanics during boss fights, which I&#8217;ve mentioned many
times before, I really don&#8217;t like. The biggest problem though is
that by not having to do areas many times until I got them right,
I really only saw most areas for a few minutes (and in a rush at
that.) Therefore, the scenery of the game didn&#8217;t have time to sink
in and create a lasting memory for me. I think that&#8217;s really
annoying. I almost want to play it again on EE, but then my sanity
checks and I have no desire to go through the horrible combat. I
wish Kojima Productions would realize that the sneaking and the
combat difficulty can be separated. Bummer.</p>

<p>Finally, the game very inelegantly gave me the RPG-7 after a
cut-scene where Snake used it, even though I had never found it up
to that point in the game. Snake just talks about having it, then
uses it, and then I have access to it. Generally these games are
good at forcing you to get things like that, I&#8217;m surprised they
missed this one.</p>

<p>On to the praise&#8230; Most of my praise for the game focuses on
its unique story and setting.</p>

<p>A few gameplay things&#8230; Since the setting is low-tech, I really
enjoy the need to heal yourself, eat food, etc. It makes
everything feel so much more real and impacting. It&#8217;s hard to
express just how that is. This game is a lot more linear than the
previous two MGS games, although very similar in linearity to the
Game Boy Color game I really liked. Basically, there are one-way
doors that lock you from going back in the world. This makes
things constantly feel fresh and new. It works really well in the
story as well, because you are not exploring one area like the
previous games, but you are pushing forward through a jungle to a
base and then to the escape. In a similar way, some of the
fundamental formulas of Metal Gear are really broken off in this
game. The biggest, I think, is that the game does not feel
&#8220;puzzley&#8221;, but rather the challenges come about very
organically. For example, there&#8217;s always been a token mine-field
that you must pass through that you are notified about, but in
this game mines appear very organically where they sensibly
should, and no one warns you about it. Another example is the lack
of remote controlled missile puzzles, etc. A lot of the same
elements are in this game, but they feel much more real and less
abstract, which is great. Overall, I&#8217;d say that I would prefer
more Metal Gear games like this, in particular, with the low-tech,
organic worlds.</p>

<p>On a technical level, there are some great aspects. First, the
music and ambient sound is out of the park amazing. The jungle
sounds like a jungle. Second, the areas are huge and impressive,
not the tiny corridors and rooms from previous games. The models
are nice and the art direction controls the exposure of their
flaws. Third, the first-person view jokes are great.</p>

<p>The best part of the game though, as I said before, is the setting
and story.</p>

<p>I love the opening James-Bond-style movie.</p>

<p>There are many times when characters will quote people from
earlier games that fill the same role as them. For example, Naked
Snake quotes Big Boss (himself) from MG2:SS and Solid Snake from
MGS1 (although I guess in the second case that would imply that
Big Boss had a big influence on Solid and gave him that idea.)</p>

<p>The whole development of Revolver Ocelot is amazing. The subtle
reveals when he is first introduced that he is one and the same;
the relationship between him and Naked; the &#8220;origin&#8221; story they
setup; and the best part&#8212;the post-credits reveal that harkens
back to MGS1 and lays a huge foundational mystery for the whole
series. If there weren&#8217;t so many other amazing characters, Ocelot
would&#8217;ve been the star.</p>

<p>In general, all the characters have really great moments that
reveal who their characters are. The characters serve really well
to reinforce the setting&#8217;s believably and put you in the time
period. I especially like the constant chatter about old movies on
the radio.</p>

<p>But in the end, the game totally sold me on the amazing heroism of
Naked Snake and The Boss. They are so honorable and amazing,
self-sacrificing heroes. I know it sounds cheesy, but it makes me
so proud of people and touches my heart that such pure virtues are
conceivable. When Big Boss was honoring The Boss at the end, it
gave me chills and brought some tears to my eyes. I&#8217;m especially a
sucker for tragedy and it hit the spot there too. Another part I
loved the heroism of was when EVA and Snake are about to go off
towards the end of the game and the Metal Gear theme slowly starts
to play&#8230; amazing.</p>

<p>I found the philosophy of the game great too. Especially The
Boss&#8217;s speech about how enemies don&#8217;t really exist, because we&#8217;re
all human beings and can connect on that level.</p>

<p>This has hands down the best &#8220;ending sequence&#8221; of any Metal
Gear. Not just the scenes after you can play, but the whole final
sequence of getting to the end&#8212;basically from planting the bombs
to the end. It is so epic and awesome.</p>

<p>What a game. I will play it again some day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.</p>

<p>I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.</p>

<p>I was playing as Xiphias and I&#8217;d never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC&#8217;d his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.</p>

<p>I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don&#8217;t anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.</p>

<p>This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.</p>

<p>The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It&#8217;s a blast to play. I&#8217;d like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)</p>

<p>I have three problems with the game.</p>

<p>First, the controllers aren&#8217;t precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that&#8217;s required.</p>

<p>Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.</p>

<p>Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.</p>

<p>But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.</p>
