  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour today on one run. I got a very high
score. I don&#8217;t know what it would mean to &#8220;beat&#8221; this game. In
addition, every time I play, even when I last longer, I don&#8217;t
really feel like I did anything good since you can manage to get
back down to a blank screen so often. Another thing strange about
this game is that the difficulty never really changes, I just
feel like I keep going and going and going but the soundtrack
changes. It&#8217;s odd.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to mark the game &#8220;Done&#8221; but play it whenever I need to
run down my Vita&#8217;s battery.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour today. I&#8217;m trying to beat the Pro VS
match. I tried first and the match lasted 15 minutes and I
ultimately lost after a good run of wins. I decided to try &#8220;Easy
Mode&#8221; to see how easy it was&#8230; and I lost twice and then won,
but failed on 3-5 twice. Easy doesn&#8217;t really seem that much
easier and it&#8217;s not worth having the green medal on the score
icon. I feel like I&#8217;m at a bit of a wall in this game and should
play it a lot less.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to schedule it for a weekly session on Sunday morning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for an hour and half this morning. I got stars in every
beginner event. I did 1-5 as Chang and I beat Isabella in Sudden
Death on the third hole. It was very intense. Also, in 1-5 I got
a crown. I haven&#8217;t figured out how to find out what will give you
a crown though. Everything seemed a lot easier with Change
because he had so much power, but it also seems like the
characters aren&#8217;t really supposed to be better than one-another,
but just represent different play styles. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played all night while chatting and burping my
new baby. I got stars up to 3-4 and did the Pro VS match twice. In
the first one, I lost after just a few holes and in the second I
had her tied until the second to last hole, then lost by one
stroke in the last. Ouch. It&#8217;s a very fun game. But I might be
playing too much :/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning we played for a bit more than an hour and beat the
game. I played through all of Wily&#8217;s Fortress three times. The
first time I got stuck on the level before the triplicator
because I ran out of energy for the Rush Jet. The second time I
got to Wily but after continuing I didn&#8217;t have any E-tanks or any
of the weapons I needed to kill him. The third time I won. It was
a brutal fight and I got really good at getting through the
fortress. I think this is a great game. Mega Man 2 is awesome,
but this is great too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for two and three quarter hours. I got stars in
1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. The game is very fun and I like the abstract
way it presents golf. I feel like I know nothing about golf, but
that I can do the game pretty well and have fun. One thing I
don&#8217;t like though is that golf punishes mistakes soooo
heavily. Basically one mistake can cause you to get two or three
strokes behind and then you&#8217;ll never get back. I went from being
1st in 1-4 to 13th in one hole and then ended in 19th because I
made another single mistake. It is brutal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed today that I could download this for my Vita, since I
already bought it for the PS3 back in 2008, so I downloaded it
and showed it to my wife. I love the opening&#8230; fighting with
Richter and then the abilitease. It&#8217;s great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for a little more than thirty minutes. We got to
the final boss rush, but I didn&#8217;t have enough skill to beat them,
and then when I got to the continue screen I accidentally
selected &#8220;Stage Select&#8221; rather than &#8220;Continue&#8221; so was put back at
the beginning of Wily&#8217;s Castle. In frustration, I quit. I
understand why this option is there&#8212;so you can gave E
tanks. But I was very annoyed that it was default and it took so
long to restart the game back to where I was.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like two hours tonight. The &#8220;gameplay loop&#8221; of this
game is very repetitive. I feel like my use of the fighting system
is so boring, but so effective too that it doesn&#8217;t matter. I still
like the feeling of flying through the air though. I feel like
that game is too long and I&#8217;ve already played it for so long. I
had a lot of frustrating times tonight when I needed to swing the
camera fast and couldn&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cute movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing. Taylor
Schilling is super beautiful. Zac was great in the movie, but I
think he looks too young for the part, even with
scruffiness. Something neat about Sparks is that his movies always
work, but as movies, there&#8217;s nothing really special about
them. Interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided that I&#8217;m not going to continue playing this game. It&#8217;s
definitely not a bad game, but it&#8217;s also not an excellent
game. Given its age, there are really some interface things that
it should have done better:</p>

<ul>
<li>attacks should not go into empty space</li>
<li>you should be able to see what equipment will improve your stats
and buy them easier</li>
<li>you should be able to see what items do</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if I had a lot of nostalgia for this game, I would be much
more willing to play it to experience the story and world again,
but I have much more nostalgia for the second game. In terms of
story, this game basically does everything I think is cool in the
first few hours and then it&#8217;s just been standard JRPG fare.</p>

<p>I do find the concept of the Old Cave with the &#8220;task&#8221; system to be
pretty interesting, but not enough to make me want to keep doing
it.</p>

<p>Basically this game will be left aside because of the &#8220;there&#8217;s
not enough time in the world to play non-amazing games&#8221;. I guess
this means that I can&#8217;t really recommend the game either, because
there&#8217;s things you should play instead, but it&#8217;s still not a
&#8220;bad&#8221; game. For example, I prefer it to the PS3 Star Ocean or
some of the other modern junk I&#8217;ve tried to play.</p>
