  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.</p>

<p>The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.</p>

<p>The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I&#8217;m glad that the characters realize this
too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny because when she&#8217;s in the field, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.</p>

<p>The real moment of Katniss&#8217; catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.</p>

<p>The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.</p>

<p>I find the term &#8220;Mockingjay&#8221; used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)</p>

<p>I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol&#8230; tense!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I played for a little less than four hours. I went from the
Duke&#8217;s Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good&#8230; still hard because you&#8217;ve got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up&#8230;
it&#8217;s all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow&#8230; just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.</p>

<p>I &#8220;love&#8221; seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.</p>

<p>I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there&#8217;s no doubt about
that, but I&#8217;m not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.</p>

<p>The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It&#8217;s as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn&#8217;t possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.</p>

<p>I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>I teared up in the District 11 scene.</p>

<p>Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?</p>

<p>It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.</p>

<p>Haymitch&#8217;s story is great.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;food porn&#8221; in the books never gets old, strangely.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; private session with the Gamemakers :)</p>

<p>The pre-Games interviews were amazing.</p>

<p>The end of Part II is waaaay intense.</p>

<p>I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss&#8217; body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s &#8220;naked&#8221; or talk about
her &#8220;breasts&#8221; and most often she mentions her &#8220;underwear&#8221;,
&#8220;underclothes&#8221;, or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;. It&#8217;s particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we&#8217;re so often given.</p>

<p>The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I played for about two hours and beat the Four Kings (on my
first try! with only 5 healing potions! boom!) and then spent a
lot of money upgrading my shields to +10 and buying Green Shards
to begin upgrading my bow and my next sword. I got myself over to
the Duke&#8217;s Archives for the next part of the game, but I won&#8217;t
play much longer tonight, despite having the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m disappointed the movie didn&#8217;t use the plot-point about the
&#8220;traitor&#8221; that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It&#8217;s a cool
idea.</p>

<p>I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine the audience really being excited about
it.</p>

<p>Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It&#8217;s very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn&#8217;t as touching.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn&#8217;t continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that if the Capitol is &#8220;surrounded&#8221; by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia&#8230; i.e. very far away&#8230; how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.</p>

<p>Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.</p>
