  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really rad movie. It had a similar amazing look as 300,
but was much more fantasy oriented. The actions of the Gods in the
movie are awesome and not quite like anything I&#8217;d ever seen
before. The actions are the humans are exciting and down to Earth
in a neat contrasting way. Mickey Rourke does an amazing job as a
crazy warlord. The movie is a really great spectacle piece and is
totally worth it just for the way the Greek Gods are presented.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a cool spy-action movie. I like how it emphasizes the
&#8220;soft&#8221; part of spy work (but not as much as something like
/Spygame/.) And, I think the fight scenes are really cool because
they are so slow and feel realistic. In a strange way, her
controlled fighting makes it almost less exciting, because she
seems so confident and in control all the time. There was lots of
neat camera work&#8212;mainly during the chase sequences. And, the
structuring of the story telling (in the beginning, she&#8217;s narrating
to someone else) is interesting. The one thing I think could have
been a lot better about the movie was the final reveal: the reason
for the betrayal could have been more meaningful and cooler. But,
overall, it was a pretty rad movie. I can imagine watching more
movies with Gina Carano starring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played another 30-ish minutes of the game. I decided that I&#8217;m
not interested enough in this game to play it. The story seems
fine, maybe a bit cliche. The interesting thing to me was the
setting of the intro movie, which was abandoned pretty instantly
and now I&#8217;m on random medieval planet (like the first three
games.) I&#8217;ll ignore a boring story if the gameplay is awesome,
but&#8230;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember what the combat system was like for the third
game (I remember liking it, but I feel like it was similar to
this) but I&#8217;m not compelled by this one at all. It&#8217;s a cross
between way too easy and way too frustrating. For example, most
battles can be won by simply pressing X over and over. There&#8217;s a
&#8220;blindside&#8221; system, but it&#8217;s basically impossible to use when you
are ganged up on, and when you aren&#8217;t ganged up on, you can just
time your attacks to never need to dodge. It&#8217;s frustrating that
you can&#8217;t really use it well. The targeting system is really
frustrating because it never seems to go where you want and
there&#8217;s no way to lock on to a target. The field is really bad,
because sometimes you&#8217;ll run at an enemy from behind, but the hit
detection is off, so you end up getting them from the side and you
get a Surprise attack, even though you clearly snuck up on them
from behind. Argh! The controls in combat are really laggy with
hidden timers or something. This is the worst when it comes to
jumping. You&#8217;ll hit the button and then have a noticeable delay
before the jump happens.</p>

<p>The game aspires to feel like a third-person action game, but it&#8217;s
not good enough at it to make the comparison a good thing. It
pales in comparison to Bayonetta. I don&#8217;t think I have the time
and interest to play 50 hours (the median time on
HowLongToBeat.com) of something that is not totally amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve played tri-Ace games released after this, because I
can imagine that if I played this on release, I would be skeptical
of their ability to continue to deliver hits. But, Resonance of
Fate was amaaaazing, so tri-Ace still has it.</p>

<p>So long, Star Ocean.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love this movie. It&#8217;s so inspirational and moving. I particularly
like the deep connection between it and the Gospel. I think it hits
the nail on the head in so many ways and is incredibly
pro-religion, of a sorts. I&#8217;ve read the book and I like both of
them for different reasons. It&#8217;s hard to say a lot about a movie I
just gush over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We watched the next episode where he spends a lot of time at the
Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It&#8217;s strange
that everyone talks about York&#8217;s scar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie has a very unique and interesting premise: a dystopia
where vampires have become the norm and humans are rare. The
beginning of the movie, where you learn about what normal vampire
culture is like, is the best and most interesting part of the
movie. The rest of it lacks any unifying idea that brings it
weight. The cure is discovered to be controlled sunlight, but no
explanation is given why this would work. The cure turns out to be
contagious, so when a former vampire is fed from the feeder is
cured. There&#8217;s no explanation offered, although I would have liked
some pseudo-science. The rest of the movie is some pretty routine
chase and fight sequences. The movie feels very much like an
allegory about American imperialism and the ethic of kids who join
the military, combined with standard liberal concerns about oil,
etc. The other great missed opportunity is more guilt and attention
given to the main &#8220;bad guy&#8220;&#8216;s interaction with his daughter.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the movie was a disappointment. It wasn&#8217;t totally
terrible; I can definitely think of worse movies. But the majority
of what I got out of it, I would have had by just reading the
Wikipedia page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven&#8217;t
really been captured by it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The combat system
doesn&#8217;t seem as advanced as I&#8217;d like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I&#8217;ll keep playing, but I&#8217;m a bit sad I
haven&#8217;t been totally won over by it.</p>

like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn&#8217;t yet done
what I did in the game, but he&#8217;s done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>
