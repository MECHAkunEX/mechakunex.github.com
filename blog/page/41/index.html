  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It&#8217;s basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We&#8217;ve gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine&#8212;again
there&#8217;s basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it&#8217;s fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the &#8220;domesticated&#8221; zombie acts. It&#8217;s really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.</p>

<p>On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe&#8230; inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements&#8211;for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t kill any kids.)</p>

<p>There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to &#8220;Kill all
STARS&#8221; and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis&#8217; display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.</p>

<p>Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements&#8212;something that is actually kind of rare&#8212;I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel&#8230; a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.</p>

<p>Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.</p>

<p>I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.</p>

<p>Overall, I can&#8217;t say I like this. <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023">Roger Ebert&#8217;s review</a> is funny;
&#8220;The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [&#8230;] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought this was an adorable movie. Rachel McAdams is really
beautiful and does a great job being tough, yet sensitive and
feminine. It&#8217;s very funny and heart-warming. It has a nice romantic
sub-plot as well as being exciting and uplifting. It really just
made us happy when we watched it. I highly recommend it as a fun,
funny movie for a boring night!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of the levels in the game are just too absurd. For example,
Episode 39, level 1 has you do the same challenge over and over
again. The game just isn&#8217;t very streamlined in the teaching
you. You feel like you know how to do something but are forced to
do it again, even though you aren&#8217;t really dying and
restarting. Obviously I&#8217;ll still be it, but it&#8217;s very
annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a
time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The wife and I watched this tonight. It&#8217;s a very funny premise: a
world where no one can lie and the first instance thereof. They do
a good job world-building and making the setting seem real. I love
how all the waiters and waitresses say horrible things to the
guests. The religious sub-plot is much cooler than the romantic
sub-plot, and I think they could have/should have followed that
further&#8212;with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it&#8217;s just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.</p>
