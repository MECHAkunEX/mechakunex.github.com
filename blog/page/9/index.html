  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn&#8217;t move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don&#8217;t think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O&#8217;Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary&#8217;s backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it&#8217;s more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I&#8217;m still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I&#8217;m very curious
how the next season will go, because they&#8217;ve been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really intense episode. I really enjoyed the cuteness
between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years&#8230; at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we played for a little more than an hour. We got to the Dark
World and got the first crystal. I beat the boss that was giving
me such a hard time before on the first try. It was cool. I
decided to keep track of my time from now on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I beat the level&#8212;The Coil. It was horrible. The first time
I beat it&#8212;after almost an hour&#8212;I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus&#8217; castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I play this while my son watched today. I spent twenty minutes
going through Stone Man&#8217;s stage. I got to him and was doing pretty
well, but the Mega Buster wasn&#8217;t powerful enough against him. The
spinning things are the worst&#8230; they crowd you and you can&#8217;t
shoot them while they are touching you. It stinks, you have to
draw them away and then jump n shoot them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another fascinating episode. I feel like it is really building to
a crescendo when all these things&#8212;Thomas, the Turk, etc&#8212;will
all come crashing down. Seven episodes is a very short season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a simple and nice episode that just developed the
interaction between the characters. Some of plot
lines&#8212;feminism, the thief, etc&#8212;are clearly foreshadowing of
greater events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn&#8217;t see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.</p>

<p>The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he&#8217;s a bad businessman because he doesn&#8217;t have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O&#8217;Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.</p>

<p>I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There&#8217;s this
text:</p>

<p>David Edelstein: &#8220;the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk&#8221; &#8211; and
[in the movie] Ted says, &#8220;Wow, what does that even mean?&#8221; and
Audrey says, &#8220;I know, right?&#8221; So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss&#8217; sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don&#8217;t know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren&#8217;t making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!</p>

cool. Collins looked stunning. I loved the dance scene at the end
