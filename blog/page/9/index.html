  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting&#8230; the concept of remnants is neat. They&#8217;re basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I&#8217;m just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don&#8217;t understand how to optimize it,
so I&#8217;m just getting by.</p>

<p>Total time: 2:15</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on my last experience with the game, I think I&#8217;m basically
done with the game. I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play&#8212;5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren&#8217;t tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don&#8217;t think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I&#8217;m doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn&#8217;t quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can&#8217;t remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn&#8217;t noticed because I hadn&#8217;t play SMB
yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to be basically done with these games. Both are not
nearly as good as Deathsmiles, ESPgaluda II, or Mushihime-sama
Futari. Pink Sweets isn&#8217;t even really good at all for me. Both
lack the insane music and really popping/flowing feel of the other
games. I think I might play MMP every once in a while to
experience it a little bit, but it&#8217;s not something I love at
all. Overall, a bit of a bad purchase, seeing as I brought it back
from Japan myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved&#8212;I don&#8217;t know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I&#8217;ve played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear doing it
all over again I don&#8217;t think. At least not right away, I&#8217;ll try
again tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.</p>

<p>First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn&#8217;t unbearable, but it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad &#8220;dead
eye&#8221; syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren&#8217;t great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.</p>

<p>Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.</p>

<p>On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can&#8217;t actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it&#8217;s a strategy
game where positioning isn&#8217;t directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.</p>

<p>On another level, it&#8217;s kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select &#8220;Attack&#8221;, &#8220;Magic&#8221;, or &#8220;Item&#8221; and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey&#8217;s) sometimes during them. Except that you don&#8217;t
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don&#8217;t actually choose
which skills you will use, like &#8220;Magic > Fire&#8221;, you just choose
&#8220;Magic&#8221;. Except that all your skills aren&#8217;t always available, for
example, you can only choose &#8220;Heal&#8221; when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.</p>

<p>It is really strange.</p>

<p>Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven&#8217;t
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles (&#8220;Press A to Win&#8221;-style). Tomorrow
I&#8217;ll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I plan on starting this game today. I thought I&#8217;d write about my
expectations before I played it.</p>

<p>Like Blue Dragon, I&#8217;d heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;next gen&#8221; games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I&#8217;ve heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don&#8217;t
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I&#8217;ve
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don&#8217;t really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.</p>

<p>I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I&#8217;m skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m pretty excited about seeing what it is like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the rest of the game&#8230; meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn&#8217;t particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn&#8217;t really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn&#8217;t anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn&#8217;t dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There&#8217;s one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can&#8217;t survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second Kurosawa film that I&#8217;ve seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
&#8220;psychedelic&#8221; scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>
