  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for a little more than thirty minutes. We got to
the final boss rush, but I didn&#8217;t have enough skill to beat them,
and then when I got to the continue screen I accidentally
selected &#8220;Stage Select&#8221; rather than &#8220;Continue&#8221; so was put back at
the beginning of Wily&#8217;s Castle. In frustration, I quit. I
understand why this option is there&#8212;so you can gave E
tanks. But I was very annoyed that it was default and it took so
long to restart the game back to where I was.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like two hours tonight. The &#8220;gameplay loop&#8221; of this
game is very repetitive. I feel like my use of the fighting system
is so boring, but so effective too that it doesn&#8217;t matter. I still
like the feeling of flying through the air though. I feel like
that game is too long and I&#8217;ve already played it for so long. I
had a lot of frustrating times tonight when I needed to swing the
camera fast and couldn&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cute movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing. Taylor
Schilling is super beautiful. Zac was great in the movie, but I
think he looks too young for the part, even with
scruffiness. Something neat about Sparks is that his movies always
work, but as movies, there&#8217;s nothing really special about
them. Interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided that I&#8217;m not going to continue playing this game. It&#8217;s
definitely not a bad game, but it&#8217;s also not an excellent
game. Given its age, there are really some interface things that
it should have done better:</p>

<ul>
<li>attacks should not go into empty space</li>
<li>you should be able to see what equipment will improve your stats
and buy them easier</li>
<li>you should be able to see what items do</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if I had a lot of nostalgia for this game, I would be much
more willing to play it to experience the story and world again,
but I have much more nostalgia for the second game. In terms of
story, this game basically does everything I think is cool in the
first few hours and then it&#8217;s just been standard JRPG fare.</p>

<p>I do find the concept of the Old Cave with the &#8220;task&#8221; system to be
pretty interesting, but not enough to make me want to keep doing
it.</p>

<p>Basically this game will be left aside because of the &#8220;there&#8217;s
not enough time in the world to play non-amazing games&#8221;. I guess
this means that I can&#8217;t really recommend the game either, because
there&#8217;s things you should play instead, but it&#8217;s still not a
&#8220;bad&#8221; game. For example, I prefer it to the PS3 Star Ocean or
some of the other modern junk I&#8217;ve tried to play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight. I got to the Old Cave and
to the Tower in the Northwest, but the enemies in the entry way
were pretty brutal. I feel like this game is almost all grind in
that way the DQ can be. There haven&#8217;t really been any cute
moments in the story since the main character and Lufia don&#8217;t
talk to each other anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We finished the series tonight. I thought the final episode was
pretty weak. I feel like the party for Katie was pretty
contrived; the discussion of the final performances was really
quickly cut, presumably because nothing happened; the meltdown
between Allison and Rex was really annoying because Rex seems
like such a jerk to her, but I&#8217;m glad that she reached out to
him, because it seems like if she opens up, he&#8217;ll be very good
for her; and the thing between Christiana and her husband was
touching.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half while we were watching a TV
show on my wife&#8217;s laptop. It was relaxing to grind a bit. I got
to the port town and met the guy who knew Guy. The story is very
simple so far, but it&#8217;s nice in a Dragon-Quest-y way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to beat this game today. I used a cheat code to give
infinite lines, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about continues and
replaying sections over and over (at least, until I got passed
them once, or in the case of the stage before a boss battle, more
times.) However, even with that, I was able to get to
Frankenstein&#8217;s in 3 lives. I took another three to get to stage
15 (the stage that ends in Death.) I did all that in about 30
minutes. I played the stage before Death for about 25 minutes
before church. Then I had a very NES moment and left the system
running while I was at church.</p>

<p>When I got back, I played Death&#8217;s sequence over and over again
for an hour and a half. Eventually I decided to focus on not
losing any life at all during the hallway with the two axe
knights and the brutal Medusa heads, by willingly sacrificing
lots of hearts. This turned out to be a good move and I gradually
improved. It took maybe three times of getting to Death with full
health before I defeated him. It was awesome.</p>

<p>It only took about 15 minutes to get to Dracula after that. It
took another hour and a half before I beat Dracula. It got to the
point where I could get passed the first form without taking any
damage pretty reliably, but then I had to work on my moves to
fight the second form. Eventually I decided to try the potion
rather than the cross, because the cross didn&#8217;t seem to do much
damage. This was an awesome move. The potion doesn&#8217;t do any
damage, but it stunlocks him so he can&#8217;t move. Provided I didn&#8217;t
have the double shot, I was able to lay into him for two hits,
then stun, then repeat. I was triumphant!</p>

<p>Altogether, I beat the game in about four hours. It felt so good
to do it. Even though I used a code, it was a pretty weak code
because I had to do everything. It&#8217;s a good example about what
I&#8217;d like games to do&#8212;be like spaced repetition systems (like
Anki), have me do a stage until I can beat it reliably, then move
on, but don&#8217;t show me something that is now easy (or moderate,
but with random swings all the time.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I gave this game a chance. Initially, the controls
felt so gross, but now I really love their unique stickiness.</p>

<p>Cycle time: 3:58
Total time: 6:59</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was cool to watch this one, because we were at the opening
show. I didn&#8217;t notice anything wrong with Allison&#8217;s dancing. I&#8217;m
one of the &#8220;80% who don&#8217;t know anything about ballet&#8221;. It&#8217;s kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it&#8217;s all beautiful and can&#8217;t notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family&#8230; she
don&#8217;t seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>
