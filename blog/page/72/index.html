  <div class="entry-content"><p>my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.</p>

<p>We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn&#8217;t stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we&#8217;ve completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.</p>

<p>The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I&#8217;m a major
opponent of innovation for innovation&#8217;s sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.</p>

<p>This game is FUN. I can&#8217;t wait to play with the <em>REDACTED</em> and his
sister (We haven&#8217;t decided on her pseudonym yet.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.</p>

<p>/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.</p>

<p>The best reviews of this game are&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>&#8220;YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&#8221;</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure&#8217;s latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>


<p>And&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>


<p>The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.</p>

<p>The only problem with the game, for me, is that I&#8217;m a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can &#8220;Save &amp; Quit&#8221; without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won&#8217;t score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.</p>

<p>my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I&#8217;d like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I&#8217;ve seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don&#8217;t need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I&#8217;ve played with enjoy it and wouldn&#8217;t like it if they had to do
more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I&#8217;d comment on it more than my original post.</p>

<p>I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it&#8217;s a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to express what I like about it. There&#8217;s so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I&#8217;ve been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I&#8217;ll get better though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn&#8217;t mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an &#8220;arranged&#8221; soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version. This seems to me &#8220;edited&#8221; or
&#8220;variant&#8221;, although in most cases the &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don&#8217;t really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.</p>

<p>However, I definitely don&#8217;t like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles&#8217; music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.</p>

<p>As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I&#8217;ve gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I&#8217;m starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post about Ikaruga, I&#8217;ve continued my daily
training. I&#8217;ve made a few new accomplishments:
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.</em> I&#8217;ve been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here&#8217;s a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I&#8217;ve had a 12 chain
stretch and I&#8217;m on a 14 chain stretch. If I&#8217;m imbalanced because
I didn&#8217;t have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I&#8217;ve been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I&#8217;ll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it&#8217;s time for the boss and I&#8217;ve got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it&#8217;s that important, but I&#8217;d like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.</em> This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn&#8217;t say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I&#8217;m a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn&#8217;t get hit once (which is good
because I didn&#8217;t have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I still love this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five &#8220;acts&#8221; of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.</p>

<p>I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.</p>

<p>Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don&#8217;t invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you&#8217;ll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.</p>

<p>The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you&#8217;d want
to buy, so it just accumulates.</p>

<p>The story is interesting but there isn&#8217;t anything too special
about it.</p>

<p>The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn&#8217;t I quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I&#8217;ve decided to stop
playing because I&#8217;ve been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great: it&#8217;s a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
&#8220;catch-them-all&#8221; with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can &#8220;crack&#8221;.</p>

<p>The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn&#8217;t
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn&#8217;t realize that you could
change a character&#8217;s skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn&#8217;t the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.</p>

<p>However, there are a few key points where if you&#8217;ve done every
single battle before them and you&#8217;ve cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won&#8217;t be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played through most of Retro Game
Challenge and just completed the last challenge (beat all the
games) tonight. This game is incredibly brilliant.</p>

<p>The premise is that a demon version of a Japanese video game
playing TV star has sent you back into the 80s to challenge you
with old Famicom-style video games. You are presented with a game
and four challenges, when you complete most challenges you get a
new issue of a game magazine and when you complete all of them you
get another game and more challenges. Each game has an illustrated
manual. The game magazines are hilarious, because they will
preview games that you&#8217;ll be unlocking soon, they&#8217;ll report that a
game has been delayed, and they have a top 5 chart with hilarious
parody titles. When you play a game, it runs in to the top screen
of the DS, while on the bottom you see two kids sitting in front
of a TV playing. I love that the friend makes comments about how
you&#8217;re playing as you do. It is hilarious.</p>

<p>The games are great too:
- <em>Cosmic Gate</em> - This is a Galaga-like fixed-screen shooter. It
is simple, but fun.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man</em> - This is a single screen platformer,
like Bubble Bobble, although you throw ninja stars to stun
things. The main mechanic is going in &#8220;doors&#8221; that hurt the
enemies and protect you from damage. This isn&#8217;t my favourite
game, but it is enjoyable.
- <em>Rally King</em> - A racing game like RC Pro Am. The cool part is
the drift mechanic. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of racers, so when I beat
this game for the final challenge I used invincibility.
- <em>Star Prince</em> - A straight-forward vertically scrolling
shooter. The weapon selection is great and the hidden bonus
items are fun to find. You get a special controller to play this
game which turns your Y button into a rapid-fire. One of my
favourite subtleties is that you fire faster the closer you are
to the top of the screen (which is dangerous.)
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2</em> - This game plays just like its
predecessor, although it is considerably more difficult and the
final boss is very interesting.
- <em>Rally King SP</em> - The same game as its predecessor but with new
graphics. The levels are the same, etc. This is a promotional
game for the game magazine and a soup company. Very funny.
- <em>Guadia Quest</em> - A Dragon Quest-style JRPG. A fun mechanic is
that you can capture strong enemies and they will fight for
you. It was very fun to play this old school RPG.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3</em> - This is a reboot of the Robot Ninja
Haggle Man series with new graphics and gameplay. The gameplay
and graphics are incredibly reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden,
although the colors pop a lot more than the original NES Ninja
Gaidens. In addition to that core gameplay, there is a
customization system reminiscent of Super Metroid. This is a
little bit of exploration as well, but the levels are mostly
linear.</p>

<p>My favourite games were Star Prince, Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3, and
Guadia Quest.</p>

<p>I /highly/ recommend this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood&#8217;s Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch&#8212;you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don&#8217;t really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn&#8217;t actually
feel like a shooting game.</p>

<p>This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I&#8217;ve managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I&#8217;ve beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I&#8217;ve begun to appreciate them less. I
don&#8217;t find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I&#8217;d rather just play the game itself. Since I don&#8217;t plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.</p>

<p>It was fun C. Viper. I&#8217;ll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P</p>
