  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was young, I played Baseball Stars a lot with my friend
Jeff, so I remembered it as being a great baseball game.</p>

<p>When I just played it last night, I didn&#8217;t really understand how
to play it. I suppose I should have read the manual, but it was
very non-intuitive and as I got a few innings in to the first game
and started to understand it better, I realized that I would have
liked it to be more RPG-like if I was going to play it alone. I
imagine that playing with another person would have been a good
experience, but by myself it really didn&#8217;t catch me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an amazing episode. It combined a lot of things that I
really like: intrigue, Gaius, heroism, and tense action. It was
masterful the way that Gaius convinced the president to do
something and then used it against her later. Very
brilliant. Now, of course, I agree with the thing they are
presenting as bad in the show, but nevertheless, I can appreciate
it as poor politics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the first three or four areas of The Guardian
Legend.</p>

<p>I was very interested in this game because of its shooter and
Metroid-vania mixed gameplay. But it was a little bit of a let
down.</p>

<p>The shooter parts were pretty mediocre in my mind, but I think
they were probably pretty standard and reasonable for NES shooters
of the era. The main problem with it was that it felt totally
disconnected from the rest of the game. I was hoping that it would
be integrated more.</p>

<p>The exploration was fun seemed to really matter and be
meaningful. I would quibble that I think the map presentation
could have been better, but I can look at it as a product of its
time.</p>

<p>The action was basically the same as the walking areas in Blaster
Master. Almost a Zelda perspective but projectile based. It wasn&#8217;t
very appealing to me. I can recognize that it was solid, but it
didn&#8217;t have the special something that capture my attention.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s not a game I plan on going back to, but it wasn&#8217;t a
waste of time to try out for a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options&#8212;choosing different characters&#8212;is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe this wasn&#8217;t originally a Mario game and wasn&#8217;t
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.</p>

<p>I also use Peach by the way, she&#8217;s the best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I&#8217;ve played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can&#8217;t deal
with it.</p>

<p>The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played some of Iron Tank the other day.</p>

<p>This was a super retro-goggle game. I didn&#8217;t like it at all, but I
remember playing the first level sooo many times as a kid.</p>

<p>I found the controls to be really sloppy and the game to be too
slow. This is definitely a common complaint I have, but I want
games that are very exciting and fast. I don&#8217;t have the patience
for ones that are too mind-numbing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to play through Final Fantasy 13 again in preparation
for Final Fantasy 13-2&#8217;s release.</p>

<p>I started on 2011/11/26 and finished on 2012/01/09 and played it
basically every day. I intended to just critical path the story
and not do any side quests or grinding of any kind. I kept that up
until the final boss area. It took 23 hours (23:15) to get to Gran
Pulse, about 12 hours (34:40) to get through Pulse and then 3
hours (38:45) to get to the final area. At that point I decided
that I would get all the achievements, so I grinded for 30 hours
(64:30), then did side quests for about 9 hours (73:45), then
grinded a bit more (77:57), then beat the game (79:56), and then
finished the remaining side quests and trophies (88:54). It was
interesting that this was the same amount of time as the last time
I played through and didn&#8217;t get everything.</p>

<p>Playing through the second time really solidified for me how
awesome this game is. It does an amazing job at making the combat
section action-packed and skill based. I remember being totally
destroyed by a few bosses the first time through the game; and
this time even though I was less powerful after I was beat once, I
could re-orient my strategy based on a better understanding of the
mechanics and conquer it.</p>

<p>I still think there are some improvements that could be made. I
noticed that the voice acting throughout Pulse is much worse than
the rest of the voice acting. I was bugged by how important
position was in combat, even though you can&#8217;t really influence
it. I was also re-convinced that the game is way too stingy on
money and experience.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, it was amazing and it definitely enters the FF
canon for me. I look forward to the next one with great
anticipation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played a bunch of Double Dragon the other day.</p>

<p>This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,
playing through a bunch of it recently really made it seem pretty
lame. I pretty much steam-rolled the game up through the end of
Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.</p>
