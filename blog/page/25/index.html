  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m glad things worked out with the cliffhanger from the last
episode. I&#8217;m very curious about what&#8217;s going on with the babies
and all that. I really have no confidence with if the rescue will
succeed. If it doesn&#8217;t, then what is going to happen to the
fleet, just die? If it does, then they&#8217;re back to what the show
was before without much exploration of what could have been
really interesting. It seems strange to end the New Caprica
sequence so quickly.</p>

<p>One thing I wondered during this episode was&#8230; what were the
Cylons originally for? Were they war robots? Did they do
everything&#8230; like normal jobs? What were the circumstances of
the original rebellion. Very curious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a real intense episode. I couldn&#8217;t believe that they
would kill the President. It makes me feel real bad for Baltar,
because he&#8217;s so defenseless and the only thing he can really do
is let them kill him, which wouldn&#8217;t accomplish anything. The
whole situation with Starbuck is probably the most insane one
though. I&#8217;m glad that Sharon is trusted though. Jeepers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cool episode. In broad strokes, I was correct
about what the setup of the new show is. I was very happy with
the special touches that I would have never thought of. The most
exciting, probably being what is going on with Starbuck. But
overall, it was awesome. I can totally see this show remaining
amazing.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to see the show as an allegory about the
US relation to the Muslim world. Religious conflict. Overwhelming
force. Chasing down rebels. Trying to force our help on them even
if they don&#8217;t want it. Etc. I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t all work out, but
the first episode of this show with the hero being a suicide
bomber is pretty obvious point in that direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before starting the new season, we watched the collected short
videos they made as a preview. Alone, they were kind of &#8220;eh&#8221;,
maybe the most important thing was the off-hand comment that the
Cylons said they were there to help. Of course, after the first
episode, there was more important, but it wasn&#8217;t obvious at the
time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an insane episode. They very quickly changed so many
fundamental things about the show.</p>

<p>The return of the survivors from Caprica was so quick, it seemed
far too easy and they didn&#8217;t even dwell on how many people made
it, etc.</p>

<p>The draw down of the Cylons was amazing, but they didn&#8217;t even
dwell on it and get the opinion of some of the people in the show
who would say something interesting&#8212;like Gaius or Figment
Number Six.</p>

<p>I was very proud of Lt. Gaida for turning in the XO and the
President and also proud of Adama for convincing her to step
down.</p>

<p>It was very powerful to see his reaction to the death of Pegasus
Number Six, as well as think about her feelings. Was she just
suicidal? Was it part of a plan?</p>

<p>The time leap to New Caprica City was also fascinating. I love
the idea of the military going back to the same waiting
anticipation that they were in so many years before, with
skeletal crews, etc. They do a good job showing how each person
had gotten sloppy in various ways or just otherwise changed their
lives.</p>

<p>Gaius becoming totally decadent seems perfectly in character. I
get the impression that he never saw Figment Six anymore.</p>

<p>Now, the bombshell at the end of the episode with the Cylons
coming back. That tops the cake of insanity.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder what the show could possibly become, because
it will be so different. Although I&#8217;ll probably be wrong, I&#8217;ll
give a prediction:</p>

<p>The Cylons came back because Caprica Six and Galactica Sharon
love their human partners and genuinely want to help repair the
damage they did to the humans by helping the relocate back to the
colonies and/or build up New Caprica. They know that they won&#8217;t
be trusted, so they&#8217;ll have to use the threat of force to get
them to help. Gaius will believe in this and fully cooperate, but
will be hated by the humans for this, despite greatly improving
their lives with Cylon workers. He&#8217;ll be seen as even more in
their pocket by having bodyguards, etc.</p>

<p>At the same time, Starbuck will lead a resistance either in the
city or in the wilderness, while the fleet attacks from the
air. The former President will create a shadow government that
coordinates these activities and does ultimately self-destructive
actions.</p>

<p>Eventually word of the Cylon baby will escape, or Gaius will lead
some sort of large scale survey to track it down, if the Cylons
don&#8217;t already have that plan. The baby will represent the further
dream of combining the two cultures peacefully.</p>

<p>This will go on for some time and then maybe some people will
leave for Earth again.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited.</p>
