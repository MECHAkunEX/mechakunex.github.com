about what they ate. I thought the &#8220;rivalry&#8221; between Beckanne

Beckanne&#8217;s dinner with the girls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the &#8220;recharging&#8221; missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don&#8217;t feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I&#8217;m pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren&#8217;t precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I&#8217;ll probably get used to it as I play. It&#8217;s a fun little
game&#8230; definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn&#8217;t have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided that life is too short to play games like Rayman Origins
when there are amazing games I haven&#8217;t played enough. So I&#8217;m
stopping. I did everything possible in the first world and
everything possible in the first half of the second world. The
horrible controls are not worth the adorable setting of the
game&#8230; unfortunately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I beat Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Magnet
Man. I think it took three continues. The kids instigated it and I
think this time we&#8217;ll actually play through the whole
game&#8230; gradually.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I beat Hard Man and Snake Man. Snake Man, and
his level, were excruciatingly hard. I found it very hard to
avoid Snake Man or do enough damage, but I lucked out with a good
pattern when I finally got him. I found the smoke stacks to be
the worst part of his level. A few times when the platform
appeared it launched me off into the abyss. Other times, the
bullets would hit me in mid-air, even if I killed them first
(because they&#8217;d respawn when I realigned so I wouldn&#8217;t be pushed
off. It was very painful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls &amp; bats. It was cute.</p>

<p>I think I will play it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The kids and I played this for a bit today. We did Needle Man and
couldn&#8217;t do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn&#8217;t get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whereas the first Rebuild movie was almost exactly the same, but
with slightly different dialogue and scenes, but otherwise the
same, except for the technology. This movie was very
different&#8230; Mari is a whole new character&#8230; and the interactions
with Asuka and how she came were totally different. I really
enjoyed the changes, especially with Asuka. I thought the ending
was crazy and much clearer than the corresponding part in the
series. Although I&#8217;m kind of surprised that this is the point it
ends at&#8230; I feel like there can&#8217;t be two more movies worth of
content, but I&#8217;m excited to find out what there&#8217;s going to be
there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half today. I did two chase
levels and a shmup level. There&#8217;s so much about this game that is
admirable: the music is cool, the level design is pretty neat,
the graphics are great. But man! The controls are SOOOOOOOOOO
bad. It&#8217;s like every level is the worst under-water level ever
from Mario. Rayman is just so slippery and hard to
control. Ugh. It makes me want to not play the game at all, but
I&#8217;m a masochist and can&#8217;t resist. I&#8217;ll definitely remove every of
Rayman game from my list though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished the game tonight in about an hour. I did the Miasma
Cave, the last Arena season, and the fight against Therius. It was
a very sweet ending. Overall, I think this is one of the strongest
stories out of an RPG I&#8217;ve played. The ending is a little bit
tropey, but not incredibly and it really justifies the things that
are tropes. I was really affected by the relationship between Zael
and Calista. It felt as real as a movie. I really loved this
game. The combat system was really fun and challenging. I think
the next time I play I&#8217;ll try not to get too powerful so the game
is a bit more challenging&#8230; but it was still good
anyways. Mistwalker keeps getting better and better.</p>
