  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like the setup of the story: being a kid, hanging out
with your dad, etc. It&#8217;s very adorable and heart-warming. I
especially like all the little jokes about how he can&#8217;t read. The
game-play is exactly what you&#8217;d expect and fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason I had lower expectations for this movie than recent
super hero movies I&#8217;ve seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning&#8230; like when he jumped on the grenade&#8230; and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn&#8217;t really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I&#8217;m excited to see The Avengers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend&#8217;s commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too&#8230; like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning&#8230; it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The stupidity continues: (pg 188) [The context is that the pioneers
don&#8217;t often win in technology.] &#8220;Palm Computing did not pioneer the
personal digital assistant; Apple did&#8221; (and clearly Palm has won in
that industry.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how &#8220;smart&#8221; the &#8220;great&#8221;
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can&#8217;t
really go into that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they&#8217;ve been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) &#8220;We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we&#8217;ve
uncovered.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren&#8217;t &#8220;conscientious&#8221; enough and even then
they say &#8220;almost any&#8221; and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don&#8217;t make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the &#8220;companies&#8221; we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a &#8220;Great&#8221;
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a &#8220;humble&#8221; leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he&#8217;d play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn&#8217;t have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn&#8217;t beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you&#8217;ve conquered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a fine little romance. The most interesting thing about it
is how this, and other movies (like the Chaplin biopic) rewrite the
history of the Communist/Hollywood controversy of the 50s to play
out the way that modern Hollywood people wish that it would. It
makes me think that maybe some people wouldn&#8217;t realize that
Hollywood didn&#8217;t really &#8220;win&#8221;. There&#8217;s a lot of Hollywood
dopey-eye-ism in the movie, actually. It reminds me a lot of
Hugo.</p>

<p>I think the movie might have been improved by making it more
ambiguous about whether Jim Carrey really lost his memory.</p>

<p>The reviews are interesting. I think Roger Ebert saw what it was
going for and believed in it. The speech at the end was a bit too
dopey for my taste.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My little sister wanted to watch this movie tonight, so we watched
it together. I thought it was very cool and pretty trippy. I don&#8217;t
think Johnny Depp was very good in it though&#8230; he was too much
like <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow, but looked really weird and had a funny
voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the
best, they were just so odd. It was cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the blend of Western and Sci-Fi style. I was glad
that the aliens had a sensible purpose for being on Earth. I liked
that there was a deeper world in the background, but that it was
not too tantalizing (for a movie like this.) I thought the aliens
looked cool and Daniel Craig was super tough. The juxtaposition,
though, was the best part. All-around a good time.</p>
