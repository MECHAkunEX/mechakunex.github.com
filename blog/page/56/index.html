  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through WarioWare: Touched! and had a chance with all of
the games. It is really fun, just like /WarioWare: Smooth Moves/
for the Wii.</p>

<p>This is the perfect game for someone with ADD, especially once
you unlock the Megamix and can sit on one screen and go through
the whole variety of games. I really enjoyed the retro games, but
I was a little annoyed when the control was really different than
the original game, because I felt stupid being so bad at them
initially. I thought the mic-based games were all very lazy and
easily the worst part of the game. my wife and I played the
Ping-Pong game, which was an incredibly clever use of the dual
screens of the DS.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot; I&#8217;ll keep it around to play
whenever I need something quick to fool around with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the
DS. I&#8217;d never played a game in this series before and it&#8217;s been a
long time since I&#8217;ve played a tactical game like this&#8212;although
/Devil Survivor/ was definitely tactically-inspired.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the game. I especially liked how hard it
felt. I think I only lost two or three missions (but beat them on
the second try), but for nearly all the missions after the
tutorial levels, I felt pushed to my limit and nearly losing. I
like that sensation, because it keeps the game very exciting.</p>

<p>During the majority of the time I played the game, I would make my
moves for a round, and then I would go do something else (like
practicing Japanese) and then look back when it was my turn
again. It was amazing to me how long it would often take before I
could take a turn again. I consider this a problem with the game,
although it worked out for good in my case because I was glad to
be getting something else done as well without giving it my total
focus.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about the game was how by the end, I
was regularly using almost all the features of the combat. This
suggests to me that the mechanics are well-designed and actually
useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time for the DS.</p>

<p>Ever since Super Mario RPG, I&#8217;ve liked the idea of a Mario-based
RPG, especially because of the action-based combat. I played Super
Paper Mario when I first got a Wii and enjoyed it a lot, but I
hadn&#8217;t played any of the portable Mario and Luigi games. I heard a
lot of good things about Bowser&#8217;s Inside Story, so I decided to
play this game in preparation.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable, but with a few
big flaws.</p>

<p>First, the dialogue is hilarious and ridiculous. There were many
times when I stopped, found my wife, and told her some of the great
lines. Second, the battle system was initially extremely
fun. Fighting each different enemy actually /feels/ different, as
opposed to a traditional turn-based RPG where you may use
different strategies, but what you&#8217;re doing feels the same. I&#8217;m
very impressed that they were able to do that.</p>

<p>I was not excellent at avoiding the enemies&#8217; attacks (you can
counter or dodge basically every attack against you), so I got
hammered a lot. This made me notice that average monsters would do
damage equal to about a third of your total health on every
attack. Since the players are normally out-numbered, this meant
that you could be KO&#8217;d in a single round on almost every battle if
you didn&#8217;t dodge. I don&#8217;t think I was under-leveled, because I was
able to get so far in the game. This was really obnoxious to me,
because I didn&#8217;t feel it fit the light-hearted tone of the game
and there were not very good ways to practice. (For example, it
takes about 2 minutes to get back into a fight after dying,
quitting, loading, etc; and I never found any &#8220;Heart Blocks&#8221; next
to a field where monsters were.)</p>

<p>A related problem was that it seemed like monsters had
extremely high health counters. For example, near when I quit, I
would regularly fight groups of 4 or 5 monsters, each with 170 HP
and I was able to do about 31 HP of damage each round with each
character. Each battle took almost 13 rounds&#8212;and that&#8217;s only if
I was able to dodge every attack and not have to heal. I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m that bad at games, so I find it easier to blame the
game.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is probably that after about 6 or 7
hours, I got really tired of the incredibly long and frustrating
battles, so I tried to avoid them as much as possible. I&#8212;as a
hardened RPG player&#8212;should have known better. If you avoid
combat, then you won&#8217;t level as much, so you won&#8217;t be able to
compete against bosses and other enemies, which spawns more
dodging, but now for necessity, etc. This was a bad strategy
because it really exacerbated my dislike of the game.</p>

<p>If I design a game with experience like this, I will have to
make a point of ensuring that the player cannot dig themselves
into a hole like this. One technique is to use a field-enemy
system like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy XIII where generally
enemies can only be avoided in &#8220;traversal&#8221; segments rather than
&#8220;dungeon&#8221; segments; and then control the pacing of combat through
that means.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I had a particularly horrendous battle. I fought B&amp;BB
(no spoilers). I started playing at the beginning of my student&#8217;s
final that started at 11am and got to the fight in about 15
minutes (not sure exactly.) The final was three hours and one
student made use of all the time. I beat the battle at 1:45pm. I
was in the battle for almost two hours! I couldn&#8217;t believe it!
This is supposed to a /portable/ game, as well. (You also cannot
pause in battle, which I find very odd.)</p>

<p>Last night, I was 12 hours into the game, at level 18, at the
fifth to last boss (according to a walkthrough), and getting
unbelievably pummeled. I decided that life is too short to play
games I don&#8217;t love. I walked away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still going to play Inside Story, but I probably will not
come back to this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat N+ for the DS.</p>

<p>Death stats in row-column order: 0, 37, 156, 443, 0, 110, 54, 2054
(bombs), 4 (clock), 4, 231, 134 (falling); Total: 3223.</p>

<p>Gold: 20323</p>

<p>This is an amazing 2D platforming game. It requires a lot of
precision and skill. I played it when I first got my DS, but
didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time on it (in fact, I don&#8217;t think I beat
the first episode.) But, I was reminded of it by Podcast 198x when
they compared it to Super Meat Boy, which I just got on XBLA. So,
since I&#8217;m DS-bound, I decided to play it.</p>

<p>I beat all the episodes and all the levels (I think there&#8217;s
about 250.) The satisfaction I get from this game is shmup like:
you have an incredibly difficult challenge that you tackle bit by
bit&#8212;getting a little bit further in the level each time. It&#8217;s a
great feeling to defeat something so difficult.</p>

<p>The game is incredibly exhilarating too. For example, there are
sentries that target you with their lasers and fire. You can see
the cross-hair starting to follow you and lock-on (it turns red
when it does); my heart races when I am avoiding laser
fire. Similarly, there are heat-seeking missiles that get on your
tail and it is a blast to avoid them.</p>

<p>The game is more physics-based than most platformers I&#8217;ve
played. A lot of levels require a certain amount of momentum to
get passed segments; gravity is actually acceleration rather than
velocity; etc. This makes an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>The game has perfect control. I can&#8217;t think of anything that
could be better about it.</p>

<p>I think the only thing the game lacks is kickin music. I know
there was music, but it is totally forgetable.</p>

<p>Overall, amazing game: A+</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a video that gives a good taste of the game and one of the
hardest levels: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYVr3GpBIHM">Episode 38</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the flood, I haven&#8217;t been able to play my normal game
regime. I decided to play a DS game, since that still works. I
picked up Nostalgia.</p>

<p>This game is great. It is basically Indiana Jones the RPG. The
alternate history world is really fun. The battle system is
straight-forward and classic, but still fun. The skill system is
interesting, although I didn&#8217;t find it that necessary to actually
use the skills much. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot.</p>

<p>The main problem is that after 12 hours, I had to stop because
I hit a well-known glitch in the game that stops your
progression. I read a few people on forums talking about the
problem and having to return the game, etc. Very disappointing,
but it was a fun experience while it lasted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the plane ride back from New England for Thanksgiving, I beat
New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I started playing the game in August 2009 on a trip to Oregon
for a wedding, but I hit a wall in my progress after the second
tower in World 6. It was very frustrating, so I only played it
occasionally (less than monthly), basically whenever I was bored
and had a few moments. On the ride out to Boston this year, I did
exactly that. And again as I was sitting around with my family one
night. Then. I beat the level! I played regularly the rest of the
trip and by the flight home, I&#8217;d beaten it.</p>

<p>Most of my opinion of the game revolve around the last World
and my painful experience with the progress wall. Obviously it is
very frustrating not to make any progress. I think the biggest
problem was that even when I could beat a level, you are
restricted from saving until after a tower or castle, so you had
to have a successful string and a long time to play to make
progress. NSMBW solved this problem with the Quick Save system,
although I see no reason to not have Save anywhere unlocked from
the beginning. The final level&#8217;s maze was really frustrating&#8212;I
made it there over 10 times and tried different patterns over and
over again, running out of time and then lives each time, before
looking it up online (which was a miracle, because I was on a
plane.)</p>

<p>I thought the physics in the game after more off than NSMBW. I
thought that the additional power-ups were mostly all dumb.</p>

<p>But, I love platformers and Mario in particular, so it was
really fun, especially when you&#8217;re on a roll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe how good this game is. It is stunningly
beautiful. The gameplay is really fun and never gets old. The
story is unique. Wow, just wow.</p>

<p>A few things I really loved:
- The backgrounds are DEEP and many layered. I loved walking
through a forest and seeing the shaded groves in the back. I
loved walking through the countryside and seeing houses in the
background. The detail is just exceptional.
- I love the interaction with the environment during battle. For
example, you&#8217;ll be fighting in a bamboo forest, and when you
attack you will cut bamboo shoots and they&#8217;ll fall down. It is a
really subtle effect, but it feels and looks great when it
happens.
- I love the art on the food that the characters eat and the
animation of bites being taken out of it. Again, it is a very
subtle and funny thing to see, but I liked it so much I went out
of my way to eat everything so I could see what it looked
like. It made me hungry for Japanese food.
- I enjoy that the characters can hang out a hot spring to get
rejuvenated. It is especially funny when they run into a spirit,
a monkey, or the other character while they&#8217;re there, because
there&#8217;s always funny dialogue.
- I like that both stories revolve around a woman: Momohime is the
central character of her story, although the possessing spirit
is also important; Kisuke is not really the central character in
his, instead Torahime is.
- I /really/ like how the characters talk trash against enemies in
the dialogue sequences before they fight them. It is really
funny and the style of their trash talk is really unique too.</p>

<p>A few things I thought could be better:
- It was a pain to see how many souls you&#8217;d collected, because it
was on the Start menu or the main screen. It was a few clicks
away.
- The animation getting out of battle was a little slow and didn&#8217;t
kick in until all the souls had floated to you. So there were
quite a few times when I was traveling a far distance and was
annoyed that I had to wait so long to move again.
- It was annoying to keep track of which Enemy Lairs you&#8217;d
defeated, because there was not &#8220;Todo list&#8221; and they looked the
same on the map before and after you&#8217;d completed them (although
not before and after you&#8217;d unlocked them, but you don&#8217;t find out
the level recommendation until you&#8217;d unlocked them.)</p>

<p>One way you can tell how much I liked the game was my desire to
complete /everything/. The game has two characters and
three endings per character. Here are my stats for my
playthroughs:
- Momohime: 1st ending: 7 hours, 32 minutes; Level 47
- Kisuke: 1st ending: 5 hours, 40 minutes; Level 41
- Momohime: 2nd ending: 11 hours, 51 minutes; Level 92
- Kisuke: 2nd ending: 6 hours, 27 minutes; Level 49
- Momohime: 3rd ending: 13 hours, 20 minutes; Level 99
- Kisuke: 3rd ending: 9 hours, 5 minutes; Level 86</p>

<p>I really liked the game and highly recommend it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.</p>

<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing&#8212;I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the &#8220;Time = Progress&#8221; equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn&#8217;t worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn&#8217;t going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.</p>

<p>The character progression system was fun&#8212;on the surface&#8212;it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone&#8217;s class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn&#8217;t love it enough
to really get into that.</p>

<p>I pretty much ignored the &#8220;quests&#8221; because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn&#8217;t do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don&#8217;t
love the game, I&#8217;m not taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren&#8217;t really for the solo player I
typically am.</p>

<p>The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I&#8217;ve briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.</p>

<p>Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn&#8217;t really pay of either.</p>

<p>On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.</p>

<p>I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character&#8217;s appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It&#8217;s funny how
close it goes to the JRPG cliché of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I&#8217;ll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.</p>
