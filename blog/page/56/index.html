  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly&#8212;every two days&#8212;and I haven&#8217;t stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game&#8230; i.e. got to the ending sequence&#8230; on
September 30th, but I&#8217;ve been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b">Here&#8217;s a video commentary</a> of the whole
normal game.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant game. It&#8217;s amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren&#8217;t reflected in the replay. If that&#8217;s the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.</p>

<p>Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a &#8220;puzzle&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren&#8217;t logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It&#8217;s very neat and you don&#8217;t need to have it
explained that you are racing, it&#8217;s so obvious when you start.</p>

<p>The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+&#8230; a game I really loved&#8230; on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.</p>

<p>Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you&#8217;d done before.</p>

<p>I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It&#8217;s an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Gran Turismo 5 for Christmas for my dad and I. I&#8217;d never
really been super into a racing game before, although I played a
racing game for the SNES and I got a diddly wheel for the PS1 to
play Ridge Racer with. I remember going over Sean&#8217;s house and
seeing his brother play Gran Turismo 1, but it&#8217;s always been in my
periphery since then. I&#8217;d been hearing a lot about how awesome the
game was and how demanding it was of your skill, so I decided to
make it a new hobby. Due to the flood, it took until some time in
January to start playing regularly. After getting started with the
controller I decided that I needed a racing wheel and a stand for
it. That was a really good idea, because it made the game so much
more awesome.</p>

<p>From January to September, I played the game every day. For the
first two-ish months I would play for about an hour or so, but
after that I would just do one race/event per night. After
September, I&#8217;ve been playing every two-ish days. After getting up
to the Extreme series in Spec A, I switched to closing out all the
Spec B races. In each case, I would not proceed until I got a gold
on every event (although I delayed a pre-Extreme event because it
was very very difficult.) After closing out the Spec B, I went
back and finished the other Extreme events. My statistics right
now are:</p>

<p>A-Spec Level: 28
B-Spec Level: 40
Game Progress: 95 %
Current Credits: 13,585,072
Total Wins: 303
No. of Cars Owned: 135
Trophies Earned: 50 %
Total Distance Driven: 42,292.1 Miles
Licenses: S (Gold: 25; Silver: 8; Bronze: 27)</p>

<p>Right now, I only have one Spec A event in Extreme left&#8230; the
Formula GT races (which are incredibly difficult) and all the Spec
A Endurance races. Plus I&#8217;d like to go back and get gold in every
License test and I haven&#8217;t done many Special Events.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m at the point where every task left in the game
(i.e. the 5% of the game that remains) is excruciatingly difficult
and often very time consuming. For example, each Formula GT race
takes about 30 minutes and you need to do six of them to win the
event. You can save the game in between races, but you can&#8217;t
tackle the courses piecemeal. The Endurance races were incredibly
tedious even on Spec B (which is AI controlled)&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine
how horrible they would be in Spec A.</p>

<p>Given how much time I&#8217;ve played the game&#8230; obviously it is
amazing. I wish there were more of the average difficulty races,
because I&#8217;m now at the depressing stage of playing the game more
and more. Basically, I wish I could play the game for ever and
keep making incremental progress, whereas right now I feel like I
need to jump a really big wall.</p>

<p>Overall, my favourite thing about the game was the nice difficulty
curve that made you always feel like you were improving and the
general skill that I feel like I&#8217;ve acquired because of it. It&#8217;s
almost like a shmup in a sense, because you have to gain personal
skill to do well. There were some awesome moments at the beginning
of the game when I was shaving milliseconds of trial times to get
a gold trophy. It was very satisfying to do. Sometimes though it
feels like you just need to get a better car to even have a chance
at certain races and it is hard to tell when that is. I think the
UI could be improved to give you some indication that your car is
very weak relative to the competition. Eventually I started using
a guide to recommend which cars to get&#8230; because there are so
many it is hard to decide what to buy at any one time.</p>

<p>The graphics and sound are amazing, as expected. The
side-of-the-road textures are really bad when you are going slow
(because you are terrible) but at the right speed they are
great. I had a little bit of screen tearing, but I get the feeling
it was something with my TV rather than the game. My favourite
tracks were the forest tracks where you got to see the interplay
of shadows and light. Very beautiful.</p>

<p>When I was doing Spec B at the end, I found the RPG side of the
game&#8230; getting credits and cars and upgrades to be strangely
satisfying. I can&#8217;t reiterate enough how absurd the Endurance
races are. There are 9, 12, 24 hour, etc races. It is
ridiculous. I would leave the game on over night or all day to
just finish them once I knew I had a strong enough driver, car,
and pit-strategy to just win with no effort. I wish there were a
&#8220;Simulate until the end of the race&#8221; button. The worst was
grinding the XP to get to the final race. I was a little annoyed
that nothing happened when I beat every single Spec B race.</p>

<p>I will continue playing the game. The main question is whether I
keep pushing at the remaining 5% or if I select the part of the
game that I like and keep doing it over and over. Probably a
balance of the two. However, I don&#8217;t think it would be possible
for me to actually play the whole game from the start again. Maybe
if they had some way of locking you out of certain driving assists
to have a different &#8220;difficulty&#8221; level, I would consider it. But
Gran Turismo 6&#8230;. probably :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played through the Battlefield 3 campaign.</p>

<p>A friend of mine lent me the game because he had played through it
and enjoyed it.</p>

<p>A little background before I discussed the game. I played through
all the original id FPS games: Wolf, Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2,
and then Quake 3. I got really into deathmatch around Quake 2 time
and played very competitively. The only console FPS games I have
ever played were Modern Warfare 1 and this. I basically had a 10
year gap of playing FPS games and have never played one on the
computer since then.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed about this game was that the language
was very poor in attempt to be realistic, although they seem to
almost exclusively use the F swear word. This is most prominent in
the very beginning of the game when you are with a group of
people.</p>

<p>The graphics are quite good, although nothing really
spectacular. In some places, there are really bad glitches. For
example when you a driving a tank quickly there are fields of
shrubs popping into existence in front of you as you drive. The
degree to which they go to duplicate film is almost
embarrassing. There are many fake film grains and &#8220;dust in the
air&#8221; effects. One character model looks exactly like the voice
actor (who is a relatively famous actor). Why not just be a movie
if you really want to be a movie? While playing the game, the most
impressive thing is the lighting.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed quickly about the game is how slow it
is. You feel like you are crawling all the time or that there is a
run button that you can&#8217;t find and thus are in stealth mode or
something. This sluggishness extends to the aiming controls as
well. I found that the sensitively just increased the size of the
&#8220;jumps&#8221; rather than their frequency. This is definitely a place
where old games were vastly superior. I assume the change is to
support the inferior console controls and/or inferior mass player
population.</p>

<p>I assumed that it would be fun to be part of a squad and run
around with other dudes. But most of the time you are just
following one guy (with a giant &#8220;Follow&#8221; marker on his head) and
then you get somewhere and they give you something important to
do. (Inexplicably you are the best at everything, yet need to
always be told exactly what to do.) An annoying necessity to give
the player something exciting to do.</p>

<p>The squad mechanics are related to my least favourite thing about
the game: you feel like you never accomplished anything. There
were many times where I was with my squad trying to advance or
defend some position and there seem to be an infinite number of
attackers (both at that instant and because more would come) but
then I kill one guy and suddenly all the opponents are suddenly
dead and it is time to move forward. I feel like the abstraction
inside the game is that X enemies must be killed before you can
advance or one from each of the 12 positions, which otherwise
refill shortly. It&#8217;s very strange and gives you the impression
that you are randomly shooting until the roller coaster moves on.</p>

<p>The shooting itself is very infantile. The aim assist system is so
strong that it seems like you can just alternately tap the left
and right shoulder buttons to bring up the sights&#8230; auto
aim&#8230; shoot&#8230; do it again. It is easily the most effective way
to play and it has basically no skill, yet it is also visually
jarring and makes me a little dizzy.</p>

<p>Dodging is just as easy because you don&#8217;t need to. It&#8217;s like an
action movie where every enemy always misses and the hero never
misses. You feel like there are always bullets flying but they
never hit you unless you are totally out in the open (i.e. not in
the right place&#8230; behind the guy you are following.) If you ever
do get hit, just duck for a few seconds and go back.</p>

<p>Since you don&#8217;t have to really plan where to go (follow the guy),
or what to shoot (everything), or try very hard to shoot (auto
aim), or dodge, you rarely feel like you have any impact on
the game or any real challenge. It&#8217;s just like a ride.</p>

<p>Roller coaster ride is normally a good thing to describe something
as, but in this case it has one of the bad aspects of a roller
coaster. You have no idea where you are going and don&#8217;t feel like
you have control over it. There is literally never any reason to
go backwards or on a different path.</p>

<p>The only times I ever died was before I learned to always follow
the guy, during cutscenes (more below), and when I didn&#8217;t realize
it wasn&#8217;t time to advance (related to not following the guy.) I
never felt like any death was due to lack of skill, but was due to
the game&#8217;s weird rules. (For example, you kill all the guys you
can see in front of you, but you haven&#8217;t killed enough on the
other side, so when you get beyond them you instantly die from
advancing to far or everyone inexplicably turns to you because now
they can see you&#8230;. and you&#8217;re the player.)</p>

<p>The ride has little breaks where you pilot vehicles. These seemed
like a preview for the multiplayer, because they weren&#8217;t very fun
or challenging, but they were just a little break. The best part
was actually the pre-flight checks on the jet mission. Not because
it was particularly fun, but because it felt really realistic and
cute. I was kind of surprised at how boring the flying was. The
tank drive was just frustrating because it controlled so poorly. I
guess that&#8217;s realistic. =)</p>

<p>Easily the worst thing about the game were the quick-time events
and the pseudo-cutscene where you need to do something. The QTEs
are so dumb because you have a split second to make a button
press, but there&#8217;s no reason why that should be the button you
have to press and it is up so far. Basically this means that you
have to die three or four times and memorize the button sequence
at do it. This would not be so horrific it didn&#8217;t take so long to
get back to where you were before. At the last QTE, the whole
sequence maybe took 40 seconds, but every time you died, it would
take about 160 seconds to reload. It was excruciating. Another
occasion was like that because you weren&#8217;t really in a normal
cutscene, but control was taken away from you, but then suddenly
you need to shoot&#8230; but the rules of shooting were broken because
you can&#8217;t aim. The first time I did I died because I tried to aim
and then shoot rather than just shoot. Argh.</p>

<p>The way they deal with failure in the game is really weird. If you
get shot at and died, you fall down dead. That&#8217;s great. If you do
something incorrectly, like you don&#8217;t get to the vehicle fast
enough, the game screen just turns black and you do it again. They
don&#8217;t depict the consequence in any way. It&#8217;s very weird and
jarring.</p>

<p>The height of the game for me was the sniper mission, because it
felt very cool and had great graphics.</p>

<p>The story of the game was fine. It was like a Tom Clancy book, but
with this strange interrogation/flash-back/flash-forward motif. I
thought it was really neat that you played the end first and then
went back, and the second time you did it, it seemed to be
harder&#8230; i.e. not actually harder, but with more enemies. Some
story segments were very meh. For instance, the HALO jump that the
soliders do is so lame compared to Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>

<p>A few tiny annoyances: You can&#8217;t pause cutscenes and when I tried
I accidentally skipped on. They give you hints to do things even
if you are already doing them&#8230; like crouching, so you think you
must not really be crouching, so you stand up, and then you
die. Thanks game.</p>

<p>The game didn&#8217;t give me any play statistics, but I started at
7:15pm (that was the earliest achievement at least, so it must
have been a bit before that) and the last achievement was at
1:38am, but I took a break to have a big snack, talk to the wife,
get ready for bed, etc. I&#8217;d reckon the game took about 5 hours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I played Contra on the Famicom.</p>

<p>I played for about an hour and got to the end of the third stage
reliably, but couldn&#8217;t take care of the boss fast enough. I played
the Japanese version so I could use stage select and start from
the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the
game. This effectively gives you infinite continues if you are
honest about not going past the point that you&#8217;ve gotten before. I
like infinite continue systems, provided the time in between
continue points is sufficient large. I feel like a lot of newer
games have such tiny checkpoint stretches that you can just plow
through. I realized that the reason I want to 1CC shmups is
because when you continue you start from exactly where you were
rather than the beginning of the level, so it feels really cheap
to do so.</p>

<p>After deciding to put it down for the day, I decided to play the
US version and use an infinite lives Game Genie code so I could
quickly play through the whole game and remember what all the
stages were like. (Since you begin a new life exactly where you
were, this allows you to plow through any problem.) It was nice to
remember what everything was like. The noises during the snow
stage were very memorable, as were the sounds of blowing up the
spiked walls in the factory.</p>

<p>This game is very tight and has a lot of friction, which is really
good, especially compared to some of the games that haven&#8217;t stood
up very well. It&#8217;s a solid game, but I think it has a few
problems. The major one is that it so wedded to the wrong arcade
sensibilities&#8230; namely cheap kills to get more
quarters. Nevertheless, this is definitely an optimal path through
most levels. For example, after a dozen or so tries, I could get
through the third stage without getting hit once. (Of course, the
boss trounced me.) I remember this game being great to play with a
friend, although in retrospect it has some bad co-op attributes:
you can kill your friend by scrolling the screen and you can too
easily steal their upgrade. Given these, I&#8217;m not sure I really
would want to play it with someone, because I wouldn&#8217;t want to
make them mad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m not sure I would play the game again or invest the
time to get past stage 3 honestly. The main reason is that it just
isn&#8217;t a joy to play. It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s not the giddy kind of fun
that a Mega Man 2 or Bayonetta is. It just isn&#8217;t the
Ur-Run-n-Gun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blaster Master tonight after getting home from
Thanksgiving in SLC.</p>

<p>I had fond memories of reading about this game in Nintendo Power
and seeing the box art many many times. However, I don&#8217;t remember
ever playing it. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve always thought of it as a game I
played, but when I stretch, I realize I can&#8217;t remember any
details. Another funny thing happened related to this game
recently. Just last night a student asked me if I knew the name of
the game with the kid and his frog that jumps in a
hole. Naturally, I said &#8220;Blaster Master!&#8221; And then I played it the
next day.</p>

<p>The game was very fun. The platforming is very simple. It&#8217;s more
of a combat game. However, the combat is not really twitchy or
skillful. It is more a matter of being patient and taking each
enemy one at a time. I thought that I would appreciate the
&#8220;Metroid&#8221;-ness about it. But, although there is a back-tracking
and an open world. The upgrades you get feel like &#8220;keys&#8221; that are
only used once, rather than enhancements of your abilities that
you use all the time. That&#8217;s a weak way to have a system like
this. Perhaps the worst part is that the final upgrade makes the
jumping feel totally off, wrong, and hard to do right because you
accidentally go under the platform you are on. The bosses are
really really hard and in most cases I resorted to dirty tricks to
get them&#8230; like going into a place where I could hit them but
they couldn&#8217;t hit me. Some it was pure luck.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do stick by the game being fun, and although I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, I would recommend it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
&#8220;hang&#8221; of it.</p>

<p>The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn&#8217;t remember was that it really
isn&#8217;t much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There&#8217;s basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that this will go on the same &#8220;Play it again&#8221; list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don&#8217;t
remember ever beating the game.</p>

<p>I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn&#8217;t work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.</p>

<p>I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can&#8217;t think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got this game when I ordered my AV Famicom from Japan. I
immediately tried it but it seems to be corrupted or something
because both the actual cart and the ROM (through my PowerPak)
have all sorts of graphical glitches. Reading the Wikipedia page
makes it sound intriguing, but I can&#8217;t try it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a cross between Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania but with
terrible art and really loose, sloppy game play. Reading about the
game on Wikipedia makes it seem so cool, but the mechanics are
just way too bad to push through to what sounds like it would be
good. I have no connection in my history to this game, so it is
easy to say &#8220;Who cares?&#8221;</p>
