  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week or so, I&#8217;ve played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms&#8212;I played on the Mac.</p>

<p>It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven&#8217;t played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end&#8212;it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.</p>

<p>I got the game <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html">for free</a>, so it was totally worth it. It costs <a href="http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287">$20</a>
and I&#8217;d say it is worth closer to $15.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About two weeks ago, <em>REDACTED</em> and I wanted to do something together
but didn&#8217;t have a movie to watch, didn&#8217;t want to play New Super
Mario Brothers Wii, didn&#8217;t want to watch Seinfeld, and were feeling
lazy. So we decided to start watching a new Joss Whedon show,
Dollhouse. Naturally, we haven&#8217;t done much at night since then
except watch it. Last night we finished the second season and thus
the whole series.</p>

<p>This show is amazing and awesome. It&#8217;s very clever, in that Joss
way. The world is compelling and you feel like you understand it,
in that Joss way. The characters feel real, in that Joss way. There
is an epic story with twists and turns, in that Joss way. Everyone
needs to watch it. It helps suggests deep thoughts about free will,
love, desire, and technology that are fascinating and
important.</p>

<p>When I watched it, however, I realized one thing more than
anything else: /TV is Dead/.</p>

<p>I would /never/ watch live TV for any reason, other than General
Conference, even for a show as amazing as Dollhouse. If a show like
this can&#8217;t get me to watch TV, and since it was cancelled the
feeling is common, then good TV simply can&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>

<p>This is really sad, because easily my favourite creative person
in film/movies/etc is Joss Whedon and his forte is the arc and the
world that are only possible with TV serialization. That format
needs some other way of existing profitably. (DVD sales, etc can&#8217;t
do it because they assume it has already aired.) I don&#8217;t have any
ideas or advice, but I wish I did.</p>

<p>The looming cancellation of the show is incredibly present as
you watch it. It&#8217;s totally true that the second season feels like
it is on &#8220;fast forward&#8221;. There were many episodes where <em>REDACTED</em> and I
looked at each other and said, &#8220;That would be half a season if this
were Buffy&#8221;, or similar comments. Yet, I&#8217;m glad the show had so
much closure and moved so far, especially after the annoying
non-ending of Firefly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.</p>

<p>This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and &#8220;flip&#8221; on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the &#8220;hardest&#8221;
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here&#8217;s a video of someone else doing it:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&amp;feature=related">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my end-game stats:</p>

<p>Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19</p>

<p>Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189</p>

<p>Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it&#8217;s easy to play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that&#8217;s how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction &#8220;mysteries&#8221; are simply crazy
things you can&#8217;t possible know until they come out of left
field. I&#8217;m glad this game wasn&#8217;t like that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Kid Dracula for the Gameboy. It&#8217;s a very straight-forward
platformer with a shooting mechanic. It has a little bonus
mechanic of different kinds of magic that let Kid Dracula turn
into a bat, walk on the ceiling, use a protective umbrella,
etc. Most of these things are only useful in a few places in the
eight level game, but they are present enough to make it fun to
use them. The best part about the game, however, is the clever cut
parody of the Castlevania series. Most of the common enemies show
up in super-cute form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve played through Cave Story on the
PC. (It has recently been re-released in an updated form for
WiiWare.)</p>

<p>It has a very unique and fun mix of Mega Man, Metroid, and
Adventure-style game play. I played through the &#8220;Hard&#8221; version of
the game where you get Booster 2.0 and I played through the &#8220;Hell&#8221;
final area as well.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it. It is free to download and it&#8217;s very
fun. It inspires me to work more often on my game ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of the past two-ish months, I&#8217;ve played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It&#8217;s kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It&#8217;s quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don&#8217;t get as many
lives/bombs during it.)</p>

<p>I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn&#8217;t registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)</p>

<p>Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540</p>

<p>Type B:
Novice = 35,715,270
Hard B = 24,875,750
Hard C = 135,740,260
Very Hard = 393,604,405
Death Label = 373,690,850
Doom Mode = 414,267,420 (4.6/5 of DOOM)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Final Fantasy 13, I wanted to play something really
light. Katamari Damacy was a good choice. It&#8217;s crazy, bizarre, and
really fun. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about it over the past few years and
I was glad to be able to try it out.</p>

<p>I really like the way you collect countries in the ending
sequence. It&#8217;s funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Final Fantasy 13 for another 26 hours (making 88
total.) I got all the trophies except the incredibly tedious ones
(getting all other trophies, getting all items, getting 5 stars on
every mission, and beating a Long Gui.) This made me almost hate
this game.</p>

<p>The post-game is much more tedious than previous games. Completing
all the missions was very fun, but the grinding for money was
horrible. I did enough to get 4 Ultimate Weapons and max out 2 of
them. I see no justification for how stingy the game is.</p>

<p>I would&#8217;ve much /much/ rather played the main game in a New Game
Plus mode with higher money drop rates so I could re-view the
story and work through getting all the items.</p>
