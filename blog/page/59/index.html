  <div class="entry-content"><p>Late last year I got エスプガルーダII from someone on the SHMUPS
forum. I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until January, when I
stopped playing Mushi every day. My scores as of now are:
- ESPGaluda II - 360 Novice - Asagi: All-Clear. 217,480,251 points. #669 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Black Label Novice - Seseri: All-Clear. 229,344,460 points. #938 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Arrange - Tateha: Stage 2. 2,888,170 points. #1320 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - Omake! - Asagi: All-Clear. 496,851,202 points. #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Asagi: Stage 2. 1,615,157 points. #1675 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Ageha: Stage 3. 12,034,604 points. #771 #hiscore</p>

<p>I was able to easily 1CC the easy modes, but I&#8217;ve been working on
the normal modes for some time.</p>

<p>The art in the game is very pretty, but not as fantastical as
Mushi. Most of the enemies are human (they leave blood stains on
the ground, eww) or normal military-looking things, which I find
kind of boring. Nevertheless, the art, given the style, is
great.</p>

<p>The music on the first level is AMAZING, but the music for the
rest of the game is just so-so.</p>

<p>The scoring system is interesting. Basically, you get gems and
gold. Killing enemies drops gems. You can use gems to slow down
time. When you destroy an enemy and time is slowed, then all their
bullets become gold. (If you try to slow down time, but don&#8217;t have
gems, time speeds up. If you kill enemies in this mode, they drop
gold. Also, you are always getting points just for being in this
mode.) Now, time is slower for the bullets, but not the
characters, so by slowing down time you build up many bullets on
the screen and you can cash them all in for gold if you picked a
good time (where good time means you can kill the enemy.) This is
a really neat risk/reward system because you can spend gems to
make it easier to dodge or to get high scores; and, getting high
scores means there needs to be many bullets, and you need to
accurately gauge if you can kill the enemy with the number of gems
you have, otherwise all those bullets will need to be dodged.</p>

<p>While it is very interesting, I don&#8217;t find the game as enjoyable
as Mushi. It doesn&#8217;t have the same pace or something. I&#8217;ve played
it every day for about six months and I think I will play it much
less frequently, and spend more time with Mushi.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve also been playing Decimation X3.</p>

<p>This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of
control insane. I love it.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it
regularly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel over the past three
days. This is a Game Boy Color game. At first, I assumed it would
basically be just like the first two Metal Gear games for the
MSX. It is, but it has clearly greatly evolved. This is the
perfect 2D Metal Gear. It makes me think (like I think for so many
series) how much better the series would be if it stuck in 2D but
got bigger, better, and more beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how many of the mechanics from MGS they were able to
integrate into the game. For example, looking around walls is done
brilliantly. Tapping on walls works great. All the weapons
return. It&#8217;s really a spectacular game. In some ways I&#8217;d say it is
better than MGS because many mechanics actually appear multiple
times. For example, there&#8217;s really only one time you need to use
the Nikita Missiles in MGS (when you destroy the only electrical
panel in the game), but there are many instances in this
game. Same thing with the C4; there&#8217;s one occurrences in MGS, but
many in this. I like the richness of that.</p>

<p>This game is technically linear and broken into stages, but in
many ways that is totally fine and a little inaccurate. It&#8217;s a bit
inaccurate because there are many stages where you revisit areas
from previous stages (but that&#8217;s a severe minority.) It&#8217;s totally
fine because if you really break it down, MGS was linear too:
there is very sparse back-tracking. For example, once you go to
Otacon&#8217;s lab, there&#8217;s no reason to ever go back, even though you
could. This game just turns that admission into something enforced
by the game. Still though, each stage is really large and they
individually contain a lot of back-tracking. But really,
back-tracking (the need to go to old areas) and open world (the
technical ability to revisit old areas) are not valuable in and of
themselves. What is valuable is when the world feels &#8220;real&#8221; and
not artificial like a traditional stage-based game. This game
really makes the world feel real because of the way that things
connect and the size of the areas generally. In fact, I really see
a lot of this game in MGS4, which has a similar open-world
stage-based setup, where many areas have internal sections that
don&#8217;t allow back-tracking.</p>

<p>I really want to think about this game as the basis for another 2D
Metal Gear-style game.</p>

<p>Here are the stats that I got:</p>

<p>Play Time: 02:56:07
Being Found: 001 times
Enemies: 000 killed
Rations: 008 used
Code Name: Spider</p>

<p>I was able to get such scores by using save states and always
restarting a room if I got caught. I don&#8217;t feel this is cheating
because I still had to overcome the obstacle myself. It&#8217;s really
an efficient way to do the traditional MGS Extreme mode where you
get a Game Over when you get caught. If I made an MGS-style game,
it would have this be an option and have it really stream-lined
(maybe Super Meat Boy streamlined.)</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I thought I was going to play Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. I
got it all ready and played it&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t at all what I
expected.</p>

<p>First, a little background. My favourite part about Metal Gear is
sneaking without being noticed and without interacting with the
guards in any direct way. I dislike using weapons and I dislike
using chokes or throws. My least favourite parts of Metal Gear
games are when you are forced to interact&#8212;such as running up the
stairs in the 2nd and 3rd games in the series or the boss battles
in general.</p>

<p>I was expecting VR Missions to be hundreds of bite-sized
guard/room configurations I had to get through in this way. It is
sort of that, except that the vast majority of the content
revolves crucially around using weapons to kill the
enemies&#8212;going so far as to prevent the goal from appearing until
you destroy them.</p>

<p>I did all the No Weapon Sneaking mode missions in about twenty
minutes&#8230; looked through the other options&#8230; and decided to
ignore them and move on to the next game in the Metal Gear
series. I wonder if the MGS2 VR missions will be better?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes over the course
of about a week. This is a remake of Metal Gear Solid with a bit
of new gameplay, new cinematics, and generally improved graphics.</p>

<p>I had never played this remake, but I played the original many
times when it came out. I really enjoyed playing it again. It was
very nostalgic for me.</p>

<p>I noticed a lot of homages to the first two games. For example,
you meet Meryl in a bathroom; you fist fight with Gray Fox; there
is a key that changes with the temperature; and you fight in an
elevator against an assassination squad. All these happened in
Metal Gear: Solid Snake. Naturally, the themes are the
same&#8212;especially the idea that everyone betrays Snake.</p>

<p>The one annoying thing in the game was the tortue scene. They
don&#8217;t tell you in the dialogue which button resists and which
button gives up. As soon as it started, I tried to call someone on
the Codec to find that out. Of course, the give up button was the
call button. Doh! I hadn&#8217;t saved in hours, so I couldn&#8217;t do it
again. What a bummer. Meryl died because of it.</p>

<p>Game Level: Easy
Play Time: 10:38:12
Save: 12 times
Continue: 21 times
Alert Mode: 31 times
Enemies: 037 killed
Rations: 056 used

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Portal over
the last little bit. The game is really clever and unique. The
puzzles were nothing quite like I&#8217;ve experienced before and the
story is clever. I love the idea that you break out of a puzzle
game and use your skills &#8220;against&#8221; the game in the &#8220;real
world&#8221;.</p>

<p>Definitely a great and memorable game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake over the last
three or four days. I played the MSX2 version that comes with
Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.</p>

<p>This game is the true prequel to Metal Gear Solid. The story is
explicitly a sequel, whereas the original Metal Gear is obviously
ret-con&#8217;d to be about the same stuff. The themes definitely
originate here: the pacifism is so much more clear. The gameplay
gets a whole lot deeper in this game with the radar, the guards
hearing you, etc. There are very direct callbacks to this game in
later entries in the series&#8212;such as climatic fist fights.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game. I initially found it much harder than
the first one because the guards are so much more perceptive and
the first area is a tightly confined space, but as I played I got
a lot better. Also, it is harder to be glutted with ammo and
rations, but you definitely get to that point by the end of the
game. I was initially confused and annoyed about when you were
allowed to save, but then I realized it was on area transitions
(when there was a loading screen) and so I was able to use that to
my advantage when I was going to a place I was scared of.</p>

<p>Here are my play-through stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Easy
Play Time: 4:59:44
Save: 27
Continue: 17
Alert Mode: 117
Humans Killed: 246
Ration Used: 7
Special Item: Not Used
Code Name: Zebra</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that
comes with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. I remember playing
Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young&#8230; it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don&#8217;t remember doing very well at
it.</p>

<p>I played through this game on the new &#8220;Easy&#8221; setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:</p>

<p>Mission record:
Difficulty: Easy
Play time: 3:03:07
Save: 37
Continue: 23
Alert Mode: 122
Humans Killed: 292
Ration Used: 33
Special Item: Not used
Code Name: Deer</p>

<p>I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.</p>

<p>I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished Shatter.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a &#8220;bullet hall&#8221; influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It&#8217;s really a blast to
play.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.</p>

<p>I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.</p>

<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball&#8217;s movement on them.</p>
