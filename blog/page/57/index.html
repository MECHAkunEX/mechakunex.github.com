  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I thought I was going to play Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. I
got it all ready and played it&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t at all what I
expected.</p>

<p>First, a little background. My favourite part about Metal Gear is
sneaking without being noticed and without interacting with the
guards in any direct way. I dislike using weapons and I dislike
using chokes or throws. My least favourite parts of Metal Gear
games are when you are forced to interact&#8212;such as running up the
stairs in the 2nd and 3rd games in the series or the boss battles
in general.</p>

<p>I was expecting VR Missions to be hundreds of bite-sized
guard/room configurations I had to get through in this way. It is
sort of that, except that the vast majority of the content
revolves crucially around using weapons to kill the
enemies&#8212;going so far as to prevent the goal from appearing until
you destroy them.</p>

<p>I did all the No Weapon Sneaking mode missions in about twenty
minutes&#8230; looked through the other options&#8230; and decided to
ignore them and move on to the next game in the Metal Gear
series. I wonder if the MGS2 VR missions will be better?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes over the course
of about a week. This is a remake of Metal Gear Solid with a bit
of new gameplay, new cinematics, and generally improved graphics.</p>

<p>I had never played this remake, but I played the original many
times when it came out. I really enjoyed playing it again. It was
very nostalgic for me.</p>

<p>I noticed a lot of homages to the first two games. For example,
you meet Meryl in a bathroom; you fist fight with Gray Fox; there
is a key that changes with the temperature; and you fight in an
elevator against an assassination squad. All these happened in
Metal Gear: Solid Snake. Naturally, the themes are the
same&#8212;especially the idea that everyone betrays Snake.</p>

<p>The one annoying thing in the game was the tortue scene. They
don&#8217;t tell you in the dialogue which button resists and which
button gives up. As soon as it started, I tried to call someone on
the Codec to find that out. Of course, the give up button was the
call button. Doh! I hadn&#8217;t saved in hours, so I couldn&#8217;t do it
again. What a bummer. Meryl died because of it.</p>

<p>Game Level: Easy
Play Time: 10:38:12
Save: 12 times
Continue: 21 times
Alert Mode: 31 times
Enemies: 037 killed
Rations: 056 used
Code Name: Flying Squirrel

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Portal over
the last little bit. The game is really clever and unique. The
puzzles were nothing quite like I&#8217;ve experienced before and the
story is clever. I love the idea that you break out of a puzzle
game and use your skills &#8220;against&#8221; the game in the &#8220;real
world&#8221;.</p>

<p>Definitely a great and memorable game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake over the last
three or four days. I played the MSX2 version that comes with
Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.</p>

<p>This game is the true prequel to Metal Gear Solid. The story is
explicitly a sequel, whereas the original Metal Gear is obviously
ret-con&#8217;d to be about the same stuff. The themes definitely
originate here: the pacifism is so much more clear. The gameplay
gets a whole lot deeper in this game with the radar, the guards
hearing you, etc. There are very direct callbacks to this game in
later entries in the series&#8212;such as climatic fist fights.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game. I initially found it much harder than
the first one because the guards are so much more perceptive and
the first area is a tightly confined space, but as I played I got
a lot better. Also, it is harder to be glutted with ammo and
rations, but you definitely get to that point by the end of the
game. I was initially confused and annoyed about when you were
allowed to save, but then I realized it was on area transitions
(when there was a loading screen) and so I was able to use that to
my advantage when I was going to a place I was scared of.</p>

<p>Here are my play-through stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Easy
Play Time: 4:59:44
Save: 27
Continue: 17
Alert Mode: 117
Humans Killed: 246
Ration Used: 7
Special Item: Not Used
Code Name: Zebra</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that
comes with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. I remember playing
Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young&#8230; it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don&#8217;t remember doing very well at
it.</p>

<p>I played through this game on the new &#8220;Easy&#8221; setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:</p>

<p>Mission record:
Difficulty: Easy
Play time: 3:03:07
Save: 37
Continue: 23
Alert Mode: 122
Humans Killed: 292
Ration Used: 33
Special Item: Not used
Code Name: Deer</p>

<p>I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.</p>

<p>I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished Shatter.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a &#8220;bullet hall&#8221; influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It&#8217;s really a blast to
play.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.</p>

<p>I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.</p>

<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball&#8217;s movement on them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played through Soldner X-2 on the
PS3.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never really played a &#8220;Euroshmup&#8221; before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)</p>

<p>The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Shoot 1UP, another game from Mommy&#8217;s Best
Games. I also beat this in one sitting on the first try. Very
easy. The gimmick of this game is that you are controlling all
your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I&#8217;d heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.</p>

<p>I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven&#8217;t
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won&#8217;t play it
again.</p>

<p>I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.</p>

was 41 levels, I played through it in about 30 minutes and did a
1CC on my first try. I didn&#8217;t find it very compelling. The
graphics were crisp and nice. It was cheap, so I&#8217;d say it was
worth it.</p>
