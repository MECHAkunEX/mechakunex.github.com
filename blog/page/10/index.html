  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man&#8217;s
stage. She killed a penguin! She&#8217;s getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time&#8230; something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn&#8217;t have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult&#8212;basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It&#8217;s similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you&#8217;re basically toast.</p>

<p>The part I got to, where there&#8217;s Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it&#8217;s super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It&#8217;s a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for like an hour. I got to the next part of the
town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn&#8217;t do
any of the combat ones. I&#8217;m really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I&#8217;m moving it away from myself. It&#8217;s
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the &#8220;stealth&#8221; mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There were some fun moments here. I loved when they were talking
about what they ate. I thought the &#8220;rivalry&#8221; between Beckanne
and Allison seemed edited out of proportion, especially
Beckanne&#8217;s dinner with the girls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the &#8220;recharging&#8221; missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don&#8217;t feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I&#8217;m pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren&#8217;t precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I&#8217;ll probably get used to it as I play. It&#8217;s a fun little
game&#8230; definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn&#8217;t have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided that life is too short to play games like Rayman Origins
when there are amazing games I haven&#8217;t played enough. So I&#8217;m
stopping. I did everything possible in the first world and
everything possible in the first half of the second world. The
horrible controls are not worth the adorable setting of the
game&#8230; unfortunately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I beat Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Magnet
Man. I think it took three continues. The kids instigated it and I
think this time we&#8217;ll actually play through the whole
game&#8230; gradually.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I beat Hard Man and Snake Man. Snake Man, and
his level, were excruciatingly hard. I found it very hard to
avoid Snake Man or do enough damage, but I lucked out with a good
pattern when I finally got him. I found the smoke stacks to be
the worst part of his level. A few times when the platform
appeared it launched me off into the abyss. Other times, the
bullets would hit me in mid-air, even if I killed them first
(because they&#8217;d respawn when I realigned so I wouldn&#8217;t be pushed
off. It was very painful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today at the request of my kids. I got to the horrific
part in the second level where you are trying to get passed the
Medusa heads and platforming. The kids had a lot of fun before
that trying to play and attacking the ghouls &amp; bats. It was cute.</p>

<p>I think I will play it again.</p>

couldn&#8217;t do enough damage to the boss. Then we did Top Man, and
won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn&#8217;t get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different
game.</p>
