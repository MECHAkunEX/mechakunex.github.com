  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although technically just a month later, it feels like there is a
big gap between this episode and the last. It is interesting the
way they&#8217;ve driven the family back together, solved a few
problems, and created more. There&#8217;s a very fluid flow to the
show, where there are many balls in the air that get caught at
regular rates, but just as new ones go up. I&#8217;m most curious about
the Matthew and Edith plot lines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an interesting movie. I feel like the main point is that
we have two groups of people with loose morals, but vastly
different ways of reacting to them coming into conflict. The
characters are pretty complex and interesting. The environments,
food, clothes, and women all look very beautiful and elegant. It&#8217;s
a fun non-stereotyped picture of France. I particularly like the
scene where the two police flirt. It serves no purpose other than
to say, &#8220;This can&#8217;t happen in America.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really neat movie. I didn&#8217;t know anything about Coco
Chanel, besides who she was and that she had a major influence on
women&#8217;s fashion. It was very interesting to learn about her life
before getting in to the fashion world. I like the subtlety of the
movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played tonight for about 20 minutes. I played two continues on
Ring Man&#8217;s stage and couldn&#8217;t get much past the Hippo. My kids
then took two continues and just stayed on the first screen
running around and climbing up the later and using the super
shot. It was cute.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just noticed that the next season was released in the
UK. This was a fun episode to get back with everyone again. I&#8217;m
glad that they&#8217;ve evolved the challenge to be more than just
Mary and Matthew fighting. It seems like the new challenge will
be this money problem and it will last through the whole
season. Obviously I have no clue, but they&#8217;ve actually got a
reliable problem to lean on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this today for 30 minutes at the request of my son. He
loves Mega Man a lot and always wants to play one. He&#8217;s very
interested in fighting Skull Man, but I went Toad -> Bright ->
Pharaoh and then died during Ring Man&#8217;s stage.</p>

<p>Something I dislike about Mega Man is the three lives system. On
a single level, it is a good idea, because it requires you to get
some mastery, rather than just sacrificing life to go
forward. The problem is that when you beat a boss on your last
life, the next level you start off with only the one life. This
encourages you to commit suicide at the start of the next level
(because there&#8217;s no disadvantage to doing that&#8230; you keep your E
Tanks and all your equipment.) I don&#8217;t like it when games have an
optimal strategy that is (a) un-fun, (b) trivial to execute, and
(c) trivial to have just programmed out of the game.</p>

<p>In any case, this game has lots of clever concepts in its
platforming.</p>

<p>In Toad Man&#8217;s stage, the rain&#8217;s ability to push you is very
challenging and the rushing water is also interesting. Fighting
the Giant Snail on the water-ridden platform was very nerve
racking.</p>

<p>In Bright Man&#8217;s stage, the jumping grasshoppers were cool
(although really out of place) and the enemies that shut-out the
lights when you hit them was pretty crazy. The sequence before the
boss door where you had to jump from falling/sliding platform to
the next one while the light-putter-outers where moving around and
firing. It was nuts.</p>

<p>In Pharaoh Man&#8217;s stage, the platforms then when you jump on them
start moving and then fall was cool. It was particularly
challenging because the next platform would shot at you just
before you were supposed to jump on to it and if you didn&#8217;t jump
early enough, you would be shocked and fall to your death.</p>

<p>In Ring Man&#8217;s stage (what I&#8217;ve seen so far), I like the platforms
that shift from side to side as you walk across them. In one
sequence if you dropped beneath one you could get a large health
charge, but you had to jump back up quickly or else you&#8217;d be
stuck. It&#8217;s a great idea.</p>

<p>This game is a very creative Mega Man game that really does
something quite different every stage, rather than executing the
same set of mechanics really well. (It&#8217;s not that I think the
normal Mega Man style is bad, but this is neat.) I&#8217;ve heard a lot
of griping about the charged shot, but I don&#8217;t find it to be so
powerful that I have to keep it charged all the time (and thus
slow down the action.) Whenever I&#8217;ve done that, I think it has
hurt me more than it helped.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember playing this game as a kid and thinking it was cool. I
just remember that it is an Action RPG. I played today for an
hour with my son and we beat the first dungeon. It&#8217;s very
fun. There&#8217;s a little too much grinding&#8230; I feel like I can&#8217;t
move forward and search, but I have to consciously try to get
money and EXP. But, it&#8217;s fun. The charge shot is essential for
staying out of harm, but it makes you less flexible, so it&#8217;s a
nice mechanic to put you in stressful situations.</p>
