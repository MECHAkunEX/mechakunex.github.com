  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a much more traditional Bond movie, with a ridiculous and
large scale evil plot. I felt like the feel of the movie was a lot
different and that the beginning is much better and tighter than
the end. There are lots of bombshells in the movie, but they dwell
on Bond&#8217;s ability to conquest a bit less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is such an amazing movie. The whole story-arc of Vesper is so
powerful and heart-breaking. The first half of the film has so
many super high energy exciting parts&#8230; like the opening and the
airport. The film has lots of great lines and funny parts&#8230; like
at the country club and between Bond and Vesper. This is really great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun caper movie. The story is very complicated and has
lots of twists, in a way that reminiscent of Ocean&#8217;s Eleven, but
with more off-the-wall occurrences. I feel like there were a lot
of things that should have been explained, because they would have
been very interesting, that weren&#8217;t. For example, how Penelope
manages to get out of Prague. In general though, after about the
first third, the characters (which beforehand were fascinating)
all have their identities fixed and then they never change. We
learn a lot about Penelope in the beginning, but then she&#8217;s
static. Similarly, the ending just doesn&#8217;t feel right given what
we know about the character&#8217;s feelings. Nevertheless, it was a
unique and cute movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a CRAZY episode. The whole plot line is pretty cool and
exciting, but I kind of wish there was more in it. For example,
Holmes doesn&#8217;t defend himself at all, but it would great for him
to do so. I loved that he was in contempt of court, but we don&#8217;t
know what he said. There were lots of clever moments like that. I
loved the way Moriarty explained that social engineering is more
effective than hacking. I thought the ending was far too obvious,
especially with regard to Holmes enlisting Molly&#8217;s help. In that
respect it is obvious, but on the other hand it is ridiculous
that there&#8217;s going to be an explanation for how he survived,
tricked the people at morgue (presumably Molly just did it?),
etc. I&#8217;m a bit pessimistic about where the show will go from
here. The ending is so &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; in its incredulity,
that I could imagine Moriarty not really being dead too. The show
has upped the stakes so much, it seems like they can&#8217;t really go
back to pedestrian plots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very interesting episode. I liked that it was a
&#8220;monster of the week&#8221; kind of episode and not an episode about
the epic story. It was neat that the interpersonal story of
James and Sherlock was explored so much as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for almost three hours and beat the game. I beat
levels 6, 7, and 8 as Maria. Then, I beat 8 as Richter. Then I
beat 4&#8217; as Richter to get to 5&#8217;. I did 5&#8217; as Maria (and continued
on to beat the game on the same continue.)</p>

<p>When I finally beat Dracula as Richter, I wasn&#8217;t hit at all in his
human form, but was hit just once in his giant man-bat form (by
the blue energy wave, that I think you are supposed to duck
under.)</p>

<p>This is a very satisfying game to beat. I will definitely
continue playing it in the future&#8230; especially since I invested
in a PC Engine to be able to play it. It&#8217;s a blast.</p>

<p>Although&#8230; I&#8217;m annoyed that I only have 96% completion on the
save screen&#8230; despite having done everything in the game. I&#8217;m not
sure what I&#8217;m supposed to do to bring it to 100%.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they&#8217;re texting, there&#8217;s
the six months she&#8217;s pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she&#8217;s actually dead, etc. It&#8217;s a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson&#8217;s girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he&#8217;d be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I&#8217;ll be very annoyed that there won&#8217;t be
any closure in the sixth episode.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about 20 minutes tonight. I used the X-RGB with the
Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can&#8217;t wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>
