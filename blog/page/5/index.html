  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this afternoon for like an hour. I got up to Bald
Bull. During the fight with Soda Popinski that I won, I was in the
second round and had him down twice and he got me down for the
second time&#8230; I considered restarting, but didn&#8217;t and won. Woot!</p>

<p>Later in the day I played for a bit more and got to
Mr. Sandman. He&#8217;s really really hard. I&#8217;ve decided to put this as
&#8220;Scheduled&#8221; game and play it weekly until I beat him, rather than
burning a lot of time all at once.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kind of appalled that I was able to get to the end so
quickly, but I know it will take a while to beat Sandman and
online I read that there is another round of fighting every enemy
during Title Defense. So it will be a fun experience, but not
really something you can binge on too much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played again from the start for about an hour. This time I
beat Chill Penguin, then went against Flame Mammoth (because I
thought he&#8217;d be weak, but he wasn&#8217;t), then we went to Sting
Chameleon&#8217;s stage and got the Armor upgrade. I&#8217;m not sure if I
will use the password next time we play. Fighting the armor
upgrade guard was te&#8212;-dious!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we played for an hour and a half-ish. We beat the game! The
final boss and the last rocket sequence was pretty tough and my
wife was getting very frustrated, but we eventually did it.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Channel clocks our total time at 20 hours and 52
minutes (I haven&#8217;t been keeping track of our game play that long.)</p>

<p>We decided that the game is a lot more sloppy in many ways
compared to NSMBW, but that we had a lot of fun, especially once
we got infinite lives. We don&#8217;t love the game enough to try to get
all the bonuses to unlock the hidden temple, so that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>I like platformers, but I like playing games with my wife more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in May, I bought a copy of S&amp;P for the N64 in Japan. On
Tuesday I bought a US N64 to play it on. Today, I got the
&#8220;GameBit&#8221; in the mail that I needed to region mod it to play
Japanese N64 games.</p>

<p>I started playing S&amp;P and it took a while to get used to the
controls again&#8230; especially because before I played on my arcade
stick (under an emulator) and now I was using the actual control
scheme. It felt a little strange but I started to get used to it
quickly.</p>

<p>I played about 14 minutes and got: 5,343,930 pts, 11m13s, and 531
enemies. I died at the final stage of the final boss of the first
level. I remember it taking a while to realize that I had to
shoot the glowing spot under water the first time too&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this in the morning and got to Great Tiger. I had a
tough time with Bear Hugger before I realized that I could duck
the Bear Hug. I only fought one round against Great Tiger, so I&#8217;m
just learning his patterns. It is interesting how this game is
almost, but not quite, identical to the NES version. There are
some things that are better and more convenient (like Saves and
Retry in the middle of a match) but other than that it&#8217;s just
tweaked on the edges. It&#8217;s cool.</p>

Intro stage and then Chill Penguin. We got the dash and got to
the boss, but died on the first time and were out of lives. He
wanted to play Launch Octopus again so we did that had a tough
time with the ships before it was time for breakfast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played for an hour and beat the first three levels of
World 8. There was a normal platforming level (although it had
lots of breaking platforms), then a rocket level, then a mine-cart
level. The rocket levels are so terrible because they are just
memorization mazes with an awful control scheme. It was
annoying. But eventually I got in the zone and did it. I think my
wife was a bit mad because she kept trying and dying every other
time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours this afternoon. I beat the normal
game, but I got a message about a hidden episode that requires a
certain score to play through. I&#8217;m interested in the story and I
feel duty bound to get this score myself, rather than just watch
it online. (Whereas I will watch the &#8220;True&#8221; Ending that is DLC
because that&#8217;s ridiculous.) I&#8217;ll probably get the chance to do it
later today.</p>

<p>The normal ending is crazy. The &#8220;Tarantula&#8221; earth is ridiculous. I
love that there is a title screen on the last episode of the
game. I love the crazy million exploding arms thing. The battle
with the Vlitra Core was horrific. It is incredibly hard to dodge
in this game because the frame rate will get really choppy and
then things start teleporting around. The worst thing about the
fight was that the two QTE counter-attacks would change the
prompt seemingly randomly so you couldn&#8217;t really be prepared for
what it would be. Argh.</p>

<p>I thought that Yasha&#8217;s voice actor sounded like York from Deadly
Premonition, but my wife disagreed&#8230; and she was right. As usual.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Later in the day I tried to starting doing the S Ranks to get the
true ending. I redid level 13, did really well, but didn&#8217;t get an
S. This made me decide it wasn&#8217;t worth it to play the game
continuously to earn the S. Instead, I watched it on YouTube and
then started watching the DLC.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>In the extended ending DLC, the Demigods-are-Robots hypothesis
got a lot of strength, because Asura&#8217;s chest is opened and a new
&#8220;reactor&#8221; is put inside.</p>

<p>The space fight with the True Boss is ridiculous. Asura grows
larger than the Earth, but it is still huge. At one point, it
seems to be launching stars at Asura.</p>

<p>The ending comic sequence is nuts too. Chun-Li was in it! I love
the ridiculous time lengths&#8230; 670 million years later.</p>

<p>The Street Fighter DLC was pretty crazy too. I liked how meta it
was&#8230; Asura entering Ryu&#8217;s game and then Ryu entering Asura&#8217;s
game. And I loved that Akuma and Asura fought for 500 years
straight. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say Asura&#8217;s Wrath was a fun experience. The anime
aspect of it was really great and I think the QTEs do a good job
at making that experience more tense because you&#8217;re at the edge
of your seat. I never failed during a QTE sequence, but I did
fail quite a few times at the big boss battles during the action
sequences. I felt like they were pretty bad because they were
just sloppy (which I mentioned above.) But, given the anime
package, they were pretty fun. I&#8217;d say that they should&#8217;ve been a
bit easier or shorter so that they didn&#8217;t take away from the
roller coaster. In a lot of those action sequences there was real
bad frame-rate problems and on the version I played there was
some screen tearing near the end of the game. But other than
that, things looked really good.</p>

<p>I can recommend Asura&#8217;s Wrath in the same way I&#8217;d recommend a good
movie or TV show. It&#8217;s 8 hours worth of over-the-top insanity for
a reasonable price. I doubt it would be very replayable (even
replaying the one level for a score was really unexciting) and
this speaks ill of it /as a game/. But as a unique form of new
interactive entertainment&#8230; it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours tonight. I think I&#8217;m basically at
the end of the game. It was cool to play as Yasha at first,
although I was kind of disappointed I didn&#8217;t get to play as
Berserker Asura. This game is totally nuts. Today I decided that
Deus looks like Ganon from Twilight Princess. Also, I think that
something I enjoy about this is how it is a lot like Bayonetta in
terms of its style and craziness. If only the action were as good
as Bayonetta, that would be awesome. But as it stands, the style
of the game is a really great substitute.</p>
