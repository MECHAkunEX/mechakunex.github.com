  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks&#8230; about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I&#8217;m not totally
positive that the game didn&#8217;t keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that accounting is accurate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.</p>

<p>For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you&#8217;ll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to &#8220;over charge&#8221; an attack so that you
go past some other character&#8217;s turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person&#8217;s turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there&#8217;s a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.</p>

<p>I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.</p>

<p>The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a &#8220;base&#8221; to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.</p>

<p>Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It&#8217;s not totally mindless. But I wouldn&#8217;t
say I love it.</p>

<p>The story is pretty meh. I&#8217;ve been playing for 10 hours and I
don&#8217;t really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.</p>

<p>The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named &#8220;Acornivores&#8221;
- The Devee dance party
- Maru&#8217;s dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started this game tonight.</p>

<p>Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law&#8217;s house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.</p>

<p>But, I never bought the game until this January&#8212;almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.</p>

<p>Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I&#8217;ve grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.</p>

<p>I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.</p>

<p>I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, &#8220;Anime!&#8221; It&#8217;s a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.</p>

<p>In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l&#8217;Cie. Then they escape.</p>

<p>Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don&#8217;t really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than &#8220;Get Home&#8221;. I presume they&#8217;ll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?</p>

<p>The battle system is very traditional. There&#8217;s no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can&#8217;t act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you&#8217;ll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don&#8217;t want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn&#8217;t really explained.</p>

<p>I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.</p>

<p>Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don&#8217;t get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.</p>

<p>The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That&#8217;s a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there&#8217;s isn&#8217;t a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.</p>

<p>The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven&#8217;t really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can&#8217;t heal him
over it and I&#8217;m nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I&#8217;m spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.</p>

<p>I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won&#8217;t give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little &#8220;Poo Piles&#8221; that say &#8220;(squish)
(squish)&#8221; when you search them. Nice!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We watched this movie tonight. I heard a lot about it when it came
out, suggesting that it was a lame movie, but with some cool 3D
effects. Obviously I didn&#8217;t watch it in 3D, but I found the normal
effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It&#8217;s the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it&#8217;s pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing this about every two days since I bought it. Two
days ago I got all the achievements&#8212;I reached the Championship I
maze and just did the next one to get the final achievement. Today
I did the Ghost Combo on Championship I&#8230; it is really hard!
I never noticed in the others that you need to beat a relatively
low local-high score (30) to even complete it, but it is very
difficult to get that many ghosts in this, because there aren&#8217;t
sleeper ghosts. I&#8217;ll have to study it more to do it.</p>

play this game, I think to myself, &#8220;Wow, I hate this game&#8217;s
controls so much.&#8221; It is so frustrating that they never seem to
work right. Super Meat Boy has almost ruined every other

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My three year old loved this movie when he was two and it was on
Netflix. I think it is very cute and does a great job with the
visuals and in particular the expressiveness of the characters. I
think the kids act <em>just</em> like little kids. I don&#8217;t like the plot
as much as other Miyazaki movies because almost nothing
happens. It&#8217;s very meh. But it is still good because of how cool
the characters are.</p>
