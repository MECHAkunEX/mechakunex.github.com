  <div class="entry-content"><p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I&#8217;m now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I&#8217;ll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene&#8217;s fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight&#8230; wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don&#8217;t think I would have really minded too
much&#8230; unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42&#8230; which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I&#8217;m liking Maru more and more. He&#8217;s so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene&#8217;s mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He&#8217;s not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they&#8217;ll get them
back and save the day&#8230; but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a pretty bad movie, but bad in that way that Pringles are,
where you think they are good while you&#8217;re eating them, but every
so often you think &#8220;What am I doing?&#8221; and afterward as you reflect
on it, you regret. You should read the Wikipedia page on the
Critical Reception. I very much agree. There are a few funny
moments, but overall it feels so fake. The best part is how
realistic the tour members are. I direct tours, actually, and I
find a lot of it to be true to life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through two sequences tonight and started what I assume
will be the last part of this disc. The concept of the town that
had been imprisoned is kind of interesting. Nene&#8217;s character&#8212;and
mainly his long history of bad-dudery&#8212;is starting to get more
interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.</p>

<p>I got all the skills for a few classes, so I&#8217;ve made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they&#8217;ve dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I started from the beginning of Disc 2 and went to the
Ancient Prison. There weren&#8217;t a lot of boss battles today, but
they were a few and a few more mini-bosses (seemingly unique
enemies, but without the boss battle music.) I got a lot of
equipment upgrades, but didn&#8217;t gain many levels, either overall or
ranks in my classes. I wouldn&#8217;t say there was anything hard today
either.</p>

<p>The story had a few revelations today. Most interesting was the
idea that the Ancients have not been seen in 10,000 years and that
Nene is one of these ancients&#8230; presumably the last one who &#8220;won&#8221;
the war and therefore is the &#8220;king&#8221; of the world, but lives so
secretively and without the need to interact with people, he&#8217;s
effectively a force of nature from their perspective, and only
chooses to interact in so much as to bug them. Yet, he has
recently had some problems with his age, so he needs to use
Ancient technology again, but can&#8217;t find it. (That&#8217;s what you get
for killing everyone, I guess.) Although, the above summary is
definitely my surmise and not something the game explains.</p>

<p>This is an interesting concept, but the game doesn&#8217;t uses its
curiosity as much as I am expanding on it in my head.</p>

<p>There were a few cute more things. I think my favourite was the
Pyre-Rat. The emotion of the machines sacrificing themselves was
very real.</p>

<p>I took a glance at a FAQ&#8217;s TOC to see how far I was in the game
and it appears that I am near the end of this Disc, which is
strange to me, but maybe one of the final areas takes a long time?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I have not needed to grind, because I would probably
quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played tonight a lot and got to the second disc.</p>

<p>Today there were a couple dumb mini-games: the wagon escort
mission and the MechaCat shooting segment. They weren&#8217;t miserable,
but they weren&#8217;t fun.</p>

<p>In Mural Town, I learned more about the world, which was kind of
interesting. It used to have magic, then it had robots, then
everything was destroyed. Still no real explanation of what&#8217;s the
deal with the world though.</p>

<p>In Jibral, there&#8217;s a really big town but it kind of loses
direction and you wander around aimlessly. I know some people like
stuff like this, because they feel like they can really explore,
etc, but I don&#8217;t like it. I want focused, tight
experiences. Especially when exploration isn&#8217;t necessarily fun
(e.g., in Castlevania it is fun to traverse and you fight things
on the way.)</p>

<p>I agree with Maru that Zola is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The final area of the disc was pretty epic. I like it when disc
changes are accompanied by awesomeness and not just running out of
space. There was a good boss rush and I actually died for the
first time against the knife throwing one. (My magic users were
Silenced and two attackers were Paralyzed and she spammed the
&#8220;Knife Rain&#8221; attack.) The fights were pretty tense tonight, which
was fun.</p>

<p>By today, they&#8217;ve firmly established that the plot is to take out
Nene, but I realized why I think it is weak. It&#8217;s because the
characters themselves are so empty. They have no personal desires
or hurdles they need to overcome. They are more than totally blank
though: each has an archetype based on their relationship with
their parents. Whatev, I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not as crazy about
the motivation.</p>

<p>My class ranks are about 26 now. I looked in the instruction book
and it says that most classes top out at level 36 in terms of what
skills they get. I wonder what I&#8217;ll choose for my number twos?</p>

<p>I wonder if my 14-hour through disc 1 should just be multiplied by
3 to get the today time? That would be about 40
hours. HowLongToBeat.com lists as having about 37 hours average
for normal playthroughs. I can&#8217;t imagine doing a lot of bonus
content, so I expect I&#8217;m on track.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks&#8230; about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I&#8217;m not totally
positive that the game didn&#8217;t keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that accounting is accurate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.</p>

<p>For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you&#8217;ll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to &#8220;over charge&#8221; an attack so that you
go past some other character&#8217;s turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person&#8217;s turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there&#8217;s a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.</p>

<p>I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.</p>

<p>The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a &#8220;base&#8221; to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.</p>

<p>Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It&#8217;s not totally mindless. But I wouldn&#8217;t
say I love it.</p>

<p>The story is pretty meh. I&#8217;ve been playing for 10 hours and I
don&#8217;t really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.</p>

<p>The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named &#8220;Acornivores&#8221;
- The Devee dance party
- Maru&#8217;s dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.</p>
