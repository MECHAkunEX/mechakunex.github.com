  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I played Contra on the Famicom.</p>

<p>I played for about an hour and got to the end of the third stage
reliably, but couldn&#8217;t take care of the boss fast enough. I played
the Japanese version so I could use stage select and start from
the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the
game. This effectively gives you infinite continues if you are
honest about not going past the point that you&#8217;ve gotten before. I
like infinite continue systems, provided the time in between
continue points is sufficient large. I feel like a lot of newer
games have such tiny checkpoint stretches that you can just plow
through. I realized that the reason I want to 1CC shmups is
because when you continue you start from exactly where you were
rather than the beginning of the level, so it feels really cheap
to do so.</p>

<p>After deciding to put it down for the day, I decided to play the
US version and use an infinite lives Game Genie code so I could
quickly play through the whole game and remember what all the
stages were like. (Since you begin a new life exactly where you
were, this allows you to plow through any problem.) It was nice to
remember what everything was like. The noises during the snow
stage were very memorable, as were the sounds of blowing up the
spiked walls in the factory.</p>

<p>This game is very tight and has a lot of friction, which is really
good, especially compared to some of the games that haven&#8217;t stood
up very well. It&#8217;s a solid game, but I think it has a few
problems. The major one is that it so wedded to the wrong arcade
sensibilities&#8230; namely cheap kills to get more
quarters. Nevertheless, this is definitely an optimal path through
most levels. For example, after a dozen or so tries, I could get
through the third stage without getting hit once. (Of course, the
boss trounced me.) I remember this game being great to play with a
friend, although in retrospect it has some bad co-op attributes:
you can kill your friend by scrolling the screen and you can too
easily steal their upgrade. Given these, I&#8217;m not sure I really
would want to play it with someone, because I wouldn&#8217;t want to
make them mad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m not sure I would play the game again or invest the
time to get past stage 3 honestly. The main reason is that it just
isn&#8217;t a joy to play. It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s not the giddy kind of fun
that a Mega Man 2 or Bayonetta is. It just isn&#8217;t the
Ur-Run-n-Gun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blaster Master tonight after getting home from
Thanksgiving in SLC.</p>

<p>I had fond memories of reading about this game in Nintendo Power
and seeing the box art many many times. However, I don&#8217;t remember
ever playing it. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve always thought of it as a game I
played, but when I stretch, I realize I can&#8217;t remember any
details. Another funny thing happened related to this game
recently. Just last night a student asked me if I knew the name of
the game with the kid and his frog that jumps in a
hole. Naturally, I said &#8220;Blaster Master!&#8221; And then I played it the
next day.</p>

<p>The game was very fun. The platforming is very simple. It&#8217;s more
of a combat game. However, the combat is not really twitchy or
skillful. It is more a matter of being patient and taking each
enemy one at a time. I thought that I would appreciate the
&#8220;Metroid&#8221;-ness about it. But, although there is a back-tracking
and an open world. The upgrades you get feel like &#8220;keys&#8221; that are
only used once, rather than enhancements of your abilities that
you use all the time. That&#8217;s a weak way to have a system like
this. Perhaps the worst part is that the final upgrade makes the
jumping feel totally off, wrong, and hard to do right because you
accidentally go under the platform you are on. The bosses are
really really hard and in most cases I resorted to dirty tricks to
get them&#8230; like going into a place where I could hit them but
they couldn&#8217;t hit me. Some it was pure luck.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do stick by the game being fun, and although I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, I would recommend it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
&#8220;hang&#8221; of it.</p>

<p>The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn&#8217;t remember was that it really
isn&#8217;t much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There&#8217;s basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that this will go on the same &#8220;Play it again&#8221; list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don&#8217;t
remember ever beating the game.</p>

<p>I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn&#8217;t work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.</p>

<p>I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can&#8217;t think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got this game when I ordered my AV Famicom from Japan. I
immediately tried it but it seems to be corrupted or something
because both the actual cart and the ROM (through my PowerPak)
have all sorts of graphical glitches. Reading the Wikipedia page
makes it sound intriguing, but I can&#8217;t try it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a cross between Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania but with
terrible art and really loose, sloppy game play. Reading about the
game on Wikipedia makes it seem so cool, but the mechanics are
just way too bad to push through to what sounds like it would be
good. I have no connection in my history to this game, so it is
easy to say &#8220;Who cares?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I don&#8217;t seem the type, but I really liked sports games on
the NES and SNES. In particular, I have very fond memories of
baseball games. I got the Japanese version of this game with my
Famicom, so I popped it in and played a few innings. It is
definitely a very weak and primitive game. I will try the later
versions though, because maybe it got tighter and faster.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.</p>

<p>Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn&#8217;t
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I will play it again, but I&#8217;ll move on to the next game for
now. I&#8217;ve realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I&#8217;ll play through it
right then, otherwise I&#8217;ll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the &#8220;play in
the future&#8221; list.</p>
