  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been hearing more and more about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>, the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/">GiantBomb</a> previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml">what he loved</a> and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn&#8217;t
love]]. And this morning I listened to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689">Active Time Babble</a> talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.</p>

<p>I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.</p>

<p>A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- <em>Challenging Battles:</em> Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I&#8217;ve also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- <em>Controlled Progression:</em> ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn&#8217;t unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can&#8217;t accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I&#8217;ll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- <em>Controlled Cast:</em> ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don&#8217;t have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact <em>in
character</em> in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don&#8217;t think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don&#8217;t use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don&#8217;t actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I&#8217;m excited about
that.
- <em>Linear Progression:</em> ATB mentioned that you can&#8217;t unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- <em>Post-game:</em> The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you&#8217;ve already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>For giggles, I&#8217;ll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can&#8217;t think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don&#8217;t think 11 really
counts anyways. I&#8217;d like to do 8 and 9 again.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently bought a Dreamcast. The very first game I played was
The Typing of the Dead, but I only played it for a few minutes to
show to Wifey. The very first game I played in depth is &lt;a
Radilgy, a shmup.</p>

<p>The art style is really unique and good looking. The controllers
are quite tight. The weapons are fun. (I really like the lasers
and the bubbles. I play most of the time with the lasers though.)
The shield, sword, and force field are nice touches.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth levels have these segments that require
spamming the force field over and over and over. (At least, that&#8217;s
how I do it!) It is pretty insane. Each of the end bosses is
really fun. The mid-level bosses are a little repetitive, because
they have the same core attacks, but they fit well and create a
nice feel for the game. (As I understand from the Wikipedia story,
those are the terrorists and the end bosses are warped
robots.)</p>

<p>My one complaint with the game is that the graphics are so
bright and there is so much flashing that it becomes hard to look
at after a while. I&#8217;ve been playing in 20-ish minute chunks then
doing something else.</p>

<p>I just beat it on Easy with 6 credits and 5 life credits using the
laser. I&#8217;ve been working on a number of different
configurations. I don&#8217;t like it when shmups have so many options,
because I don&#8217;t have a good grasp of what the &#8220;right&#8221; options
are. There is also a big temptation to make it easier, etc. I
wonder, should I try to 1cc it on Easy, then Normal, then Hard? Or
just got right to a different difficulty, etc? I can use 1 credit
to get to the middle of stage 3 (the mini-boss) on Normal. I&#8217;ve
gotten through stages 1 and 2 without ever dying as well. How
should I go about it? I plan on definitely playing for a little
while, but I don&#8217;t want to make it a permanent pursuit like
/Ikaruga/.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.</p>

<p>I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don&#8217;t remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you&#8217;re supposed to stop the music but
you can&#8217;t hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.</p>

<p>Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that&#8217;s what the
rest of the game will be like, I&#8217;m not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn&#8217;t seem that way and it didn&#8217;t seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn&#8217;t imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.</p>

<p>I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I&#8217;m quite picky, but because I&#8217;m so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recommend it. But I didn&#8217;t finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.</p>

<p>Frustrating, boring mechanic</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I&#8217;d played
it a few times about my brother-in-law&#8217;s house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren&#8217;t adjustable and the defaults don&#8217;t work
as well on the stick. Bummer.</p>

<p>I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay&#8230; like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.</p>

<p>Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.</p>

<p>Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I&#8217;ve ever played.</p>

<p>I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.</p>

<p>I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn&#8217;t use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don&#8217;t want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don&#8217;t want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don&#8217;t regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.</p>

<p>There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.</p>

<p>Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips&#8230;)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:</p>

<p>/metaphor/</p>

<p>The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against &#8220;The Power of the Gods&#8221;; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?</p>

<p>Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
&#8220;only&#8221; lasts 29 minutes, I&#8217;ve played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.</p>

<p>Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.</p>

<p>By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.</p>

<p>I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn&#8217;t come with this game,
so I didn&#8217;t play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.</p>

<p>I beat this game. I didn&#8217;t get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn&#8217;t do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser&#8217;s Castle.</p>
