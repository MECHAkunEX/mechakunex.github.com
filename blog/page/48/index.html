  <div class="entry-content"><p>This sounded like a really cool game: a combination of a shooter
and an adventure game where you travel through connected stages,
etc. Unfortunately, I found it impossible to understand what I was
supposed to do. I intend to give it another chance, maybe after
reading a manual, but I couldn&#8217;t cope with it when I tried it the
first time.</p>

the same promotion as inFAMOUS. I had played the demo before.</p>

<p>This game is amazingly adorable. The team introduction in the

<p>This could have been a really charming and enjoyable game,
but&#8230;.</p>

<p>Wow, bad controls. So bad, I&#8217;m not actually interested in playing
it anymore. Really disappointing.</p>

<p>Maybe they fixed it in LBP2?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Raiden IV a bit. I played through to the end of the game,
including the second loop. I basically credit-fed the second loop
after making it to the second loop in a legit way. My best score
was 17,036,000. (A little short of the 20mil to get the last point
achievement.)</p>

<p>One thing I really liked about the game is that there were
massive, beautiful explosions and the way the ground spins, moves,
and feels really deep. I also liked the way the final boss appears
to be The Stone-Like. The weapon selection is pretty cool. It
reminds me a lot of Blazing Lazers.</p>

<p>There were quite a few things I didn&#8217;t like, though.</p>

<p>The size of the hit-box is really unclear and seems large.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel like the enemy bullets pop out of the background and
your bullets enough.</p>

<p>The game feels like it is cheating when you try to dodge some
shots. Specifically there are many times where the field is bigger
than the screen, so when you move to the left or right you move
across the background but basically stay in the same spot. This
feels like cheating because the bullets move with
you&#8212;effectively making it like you can&#8217;t dodge.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it when snipers come on-screen and then go to the
bottom of the screen and shoot up at you. I was thinking about
other shooters and couldn&#8217;t think of situations where you have to
dodge what is behind you&#8212;except in boss segments where the
screen is fixed and you&#8217;re not scrolling anymore. This last point
doesn&#8217;t seem broken; it is a legitimate gameplay choice, but I
don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t go in my rotation, but I got $10 worth of fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don&#8217;t think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.</p>

<p>As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn&#8217;t have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s competition, is, of course, Bayonetta&#8212;a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.</p>

<p>At it&#8217;s core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it&#8217;s very fair to compare them.</p>

<p>Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya&#8217;s commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn&#8217;t like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta&#8217;s dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.</p>

<p>In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.</p>

<p>There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a &#8220;strong&#8221; attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can&#8217;t, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.</p>

<p>One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it&#8217;s really not that bad because it&#8217;s so fast and you
basically can&#8217;t fail.)</p>

<p>Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.</p>

<p>On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it &#8220;as a
camera&#8221; rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don&#8217;t recall it ever happening.</p>

<p>But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn&#8217;t have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don&#8217;t remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.</p>

<p>By the way, here are my end-of-chapter statistics:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was very curious about this game because I&#8217;m fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.</p>

<p>Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There&#8217;s no continuous spray of bullets and doesn&#8217;t even
seem to be a normal &#8220;fire&#8221; weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.</p>

<p>I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I&#8217;m too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, I bought Raiden Fighters Aces for the 360 as part of
a bundle of games from the SHMUPS forum.</p>

<p>I played it a few times.</p>

<p>It is a compilation of three old shooters in the same
series. There&#8217;s nothing really spectacular about them and they
aren&#8217;t even visually fantastic. At least they aren&#8217;t emulated
perfectly on MAME. I doubt I&#8217;ll play it many times, but I will
keep it on my list in case I get shmup-desperate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I&#8217;ll play it again unless I&#8217;m totally desperate. I&#8217;d rather
just read something on my phone. I don&#8217;t blame this game though, I
think it&#8217;s really the fault of the phone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game&#8230; how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It&#8217;s pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting&#8212;objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at a point in my life where it&#8217;s not worth it to read books
I&#8217;m not interested in, finish movies that I don&#8217;t love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren&#8217;t rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I&#8217;d like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I&#8217;ll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.</p>
