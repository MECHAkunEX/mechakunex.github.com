  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using a lot of Phoenix Downs since I got to the Yassaf
Machif (?). Seems like a bad thing. It&#8217;s pretty crazy to see Hope
as an older dude. I accidentally closed the Bresha gate and had to
redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It&#8217;s pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won&#8217;t do that good thing and you&#8217;ll
drastically change what they did&#8212;probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Omega wrecked me. The video opening sequence is pretty cool. The
time anomalies are cute little puzzles. My strategy is to have
Serah be primarily Ravager and Noel primarily Commando. Their
primary role is N, their secondary is N/2, and their others is
N/4. All the monsters are at level N/4 as well. I don&#8217;t know if
this is a very good strategy. I am slightly worried that it won&#8217;t
be possible to max out every level, but then I realized that the
level on the status screen is just the maximum level of any
role&#8230; I think at least. [004:56:03 (31/28) (8/160)]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a strange episode. I feel like this is intended to make
us believe that Starbuck is a Cylon. The phrase &#8220;between life and
death&#8221; was the biggest thing that made me think that. I found her
background story to be more interesting after seeing it, than I
thought it would be beforehand. Parents like that are so mean. I
can&#8217;t believe they really exist.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there&#8217;s
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different&#8230; a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control&#8230; like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you&#8217;ll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I&#8217;m glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can&#8217;t tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really interesting &#8220;political intrigue&#8221; style
episode. I think my favourite thing is how Gaius is always
presented as the bad guy, but he&#8217;s so right most of the time. It
is really fascinating. I always wonder what some kinds of people
do all day&#8230; like the people who were actors or retailers or
other jobs that can&#8217;t really exist anymore. I like the Chief&#8217;s
point that they should be doing odd jobs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode about space racism. That plot
line was kind of cool, but I was hoping that there would be more
to the brief appearance we saw of Caprica Six.</p>

<p>On the subject of space racism, I think it is strange how whole
planets are casually stereotyped in the show. This is very common
thing in science fiction, but it really doesn&#8217;t make sense. Given
how diverse opinions and culture are on our planet, it seems
strange to expect it to be any different. The only thing BSG has
on its side is that the planet were originally colonized by
(presumably) culturally homogenous &#8220;tribes&#8221; and thus could have
maintained their distinct (and cohesive) identities; although
that seems like a stretch given the length of time the colonies
existed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I loved this episode because I&#8217;m so fascinated by Baltar. I wish
he would get a break. He&#8217;s really not terrible.</p>

<p>Before this episode, I was thinking about the show and how
sketchy their information about the past, and in particular,
Kobol, is. It doesn&#8217;t make sense that if their ancestors could
travel through space, they also wouldn&#8217;t keep detailed records
that would give much more information. It&#8217;s inconsistent.</p>
