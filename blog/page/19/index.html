  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two and half hours tonight. I&#8217;ve been taking a
break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.</p>

<p>Total time: 15:08</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot&#8230; it made it more
dramatic. It&#8217;s also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I&#8217;m glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane&#8217;s voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments&#8230; it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can&#8217;t have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan&#8217;s insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>

temple and got some items in the world. My son really enjoys
watching it.</p>

<p>Today we played up to the boss in the Tower of Hera, but were
totally creamed. It is tough. I keep getting knocked off and then
his health is reset.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun, fast-paced action movie. I liked how the world of
the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about this show and my wife was very
interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They&#8217;ve laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, &#8220;Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?&#8221; He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn&#8217;t move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

<p>We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie was suggested by Netflix and I wasn&#8217;t sure I would like
it. As we watched it, it was pretty cute and touching. It was very
reminiscent of how my wife and I were when we first met&#8230; fell in
love over the course of 10 days and then didn&#8217;t see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years
and years past&#8230; it was a very depressing and unhappy ending.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren&#8217;t totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren&#8217;t really
super heroes&#8230; more &#8220;super spys&#8221; and that didn&#8217;t seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character&#8230; the actor played him too &#8220;cool&#8221; and above-it-all.</p>

<p>There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, there&#8217;s only one God, and I don&#8217;t
think He dresses like that.&#8221; Not only was it delivered really well,
but it&#8217;s such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I&#8217;m surprised
that in this episode they didn&#8217;t show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rally girl&#8221; thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn&#8217;t playing.</p>
