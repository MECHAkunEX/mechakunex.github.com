  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided based on some consultation with forum posts, etc, that I
will watch a long play of the game, rather than play through it
myself. The gameplay is so bad and I want to see everything, but
don&#8217;t want to play with a walkthrough. It&#8217;s more efficient to just
watch it. I found two playthroughs: <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D3368004">a 100% playthrough</a> and [[http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/deadly-premonition/5058/endurance-run-download-urls/417644/][a
GiantBomb Endurance Run]]. I&#8217;m not sure which one will be better, so
I&#8217;ll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We&#8217;ll see how that goes&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another stupid, crazy, spectacle movie. The plot is pretty
incomprehensible, but who cares, or expects better? The visuals
were really amazing. I was kind of annoyed that Megan Fox wasn&#8217;t in
it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn&#8217;t work for what they had the girl do, but I don&#8217;t
see why that was a necessary plot point. Either way, the whole
movie was some good stupid fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn&#8217;t load my Clear data, so I&#8217;m
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.</p>

<p>It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war&#8230; especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!</p>

<p>The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the &#8220;stealth&#8221; missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you&#8217;d make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)</p>

<p>I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don&#8217;t think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I&#8217;ve got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it&#8217;s mainly the story pushing me to do more.</p>

<p>It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren&#8217;t counted
in the real total. Wow!</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought this game because I heard so many good things about it on
podcasts, particularly the &#8220;WARNING: A Huge Podcast&#8221;
special. Before playing it, I&#8217;m slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won&#8217;t want to. (I don&#8217;t want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don&#8217;t bother me because there&#8217;s just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn&#8217;t finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I&#8217;m
giving it a chance, but if it doesn&#8217;t take me in one night, I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll keep playing it.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn&#8217;t hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it&#8217;s all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.</p>

<p>The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the &#8220;gas stand&#8221; is.)</p>

<p>The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don&#8217;t really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it&#8217;s disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it&#8217;s also not very effective. There&#8217;s not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.</p>

<p>The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I&#8217;m slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I&#8217;ll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I&#8217;ll give it more time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a very funny movie. It magnifies standard romantic comedy
cliches to a whole new level and is almost a &#8220;reductio ad absurdum&#8221;
of the concept of a &#8220;Baxter&#8221;. I quite enjoyed it. Michelle Williams
was adorable in it, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the &#8220;Undodgeable
Shot&#8221; ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn&#8217;t
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D&#8217;oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia&#8212;he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It&#8217;s
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It&#8217;s spectacular.</p>

<p>The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don&#8217;t really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.</p>

<p>The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don&#8217;t mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn&#8217;t receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don&#8217;t
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn&#8217;t get
from the movie. For example, the daughter&#8217;s name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.</p>

missions, all were done in a relatively &#8220;stealthy&#8221; style. It was

next battle, I unlocked a few reports, which I am now going

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thinking about this movie the day after, there are some things
really strange about it:</p>

<p>All the movies more or less establish the vampires as basically in
the right, with the werewolves being too uncontrolled to be safe
for humans. Almost as if the vampires are protecting humans from
the immortals&#8212;especially given that they have a cultural
imperative to not consume human blood. (Viktor is a &#8220;bad&#8221; vampire
almost entirely because he sometimes breaks this rule.)</p>

<p>The first movie mixes this a little bit, portraying Lucian as
having been wronged and the vampires, especially Viktor, overly
prejudiced. But, it doesn&#8217;t give Lucian any motives other than
revenge on vampires. Given that he is involved in offensive action,
it&#8217;s not as if the vampires are simply out to get him. The war is
reciprocal.</p>

<p>The second movie really lays on the thick that danger of the
werewolves with the flash back sequences, but otherwise doesn&#8217;t
really develop the reason for the conflict. It&#8217;s basically just
sibling rivalry. (The movie is also weird because it makes very
little sense that Markus would act as he does now, as opposed to in
any of the previous 100 year periods where he was the sole reigning
vampire elder. It&#8217;s especially incomprehensible why he destroys his
coven.)</p>

<p>The third movie doesn&#8217;t really explain why Lucian would continue to
fight the vampires. It presents him as unassailably moral and a
freedom fighter. But once he gets his freedom, why does he have any
reason to continue fighting? Especially given that he thinks Viktor
is dead.</p>

<p>I presume that this won&#8217;t be resolved or explained in the last
movie. But maybe not? It seems like Selene is the oldest vampire
that we&#8217;ve heard of it that is still alive and there has never been
any ranking werewolves other than Lucian and William.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really fascinating movie. It&#8217;s a totally unique dystopia
for me (maybe Wikipedia will tell me about things that are like
it?) and that is always fascinating. The plot is basically Bonnie &amp;
Clyde after an initial glance at the prejudice and hardship in the
system.</p>

<p>The imagery is really cool and there are lots of interesting and
bizarre situations, like the way Wies introduces his female
relatives.</p>

<p>I think the movie lost some good opportunities for character
development. For example, Will gets 30 minutes for lunch at the
beginning but she dies by seconds when she can&#8217;t take the bus, and
was just 20 minutes short of being able to pay for the bus
ride. Yet, he doesn&#8217;t acknowledge this for the sake of the audience
or to show his great remorse, etc.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the movie to be very intriguing. This, however, is
also its biggest problem because it begs you to think about it
deeply and the world isn&#8217;t explained well enough.</p>

<p>For example, there&#8217;s a strong suggestion that the mantra &#8220;For few to
be immortal, many must die&#8221; has some sort of quasi-mystical and
dreadful significance. Like there is some sort of Big Brother type
that is keeping people down. However, this isn&#8217;t followed through.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Time Keepers is not explained adequately. On one
level, they are simply cops and since money is time, they are
connected to time. However, in the end, when they&#8217;re talking about
how &#8220;that much money can&#8217;t leave that zone&#8221; and many other
situations, you get the impression that there is some deeper
purpose to their actions.</p>

<p>Similarly, the movie has poor economics. For example, what effect
does birth have, given that it introduces a year of time? If the
time is a real commodity&#8212;i.e. an abstraction of some sort of
energy their bodies need, rather than a fiat system (i.e. they are
like nanomachines that keep track of the time and just kill you
when it is zero.)&#8212;then where does the new year come from? How
could there be such price controls?</p>

<p>I think the movie could have resolved this better by coming up with
some sort of origin story and pseudo-science to explain why people
would choose to live like this (and everyone!) at some point
voluntarily and how it works. I think the fiat system would have
been interesting, because it makes it so there&#8217;s actually a
solution that they could possibly reach. But, as it is, we can&#8217;t
imagine that Will and Sylvia will ever actually fix
anything&#8230; other than what communists and Robin Hoods try to do
and fail to do in the real world.</p>

<p>The movie is very confused, therefore, with what its message (and
the message of its heroes) really is. Philippe spouts
pseudo-Capitalism, so perhaps the movie is anti-Capitalism? Yet,
the corruption of the Time Keepers vis a vis Fortis is reminiscent
of the relationship between the US and e.g. African dictators. So,
is it an anti &#8220;Globalization&#8221; or &#8220;Imperialist&#8221; politic?</p>

<p>I think because they don&#8217;t foreshadow a solution or great evil
through technology or metaphysics, the world must be a &#8220;natural&#8221;
world and so the villain must be natural, and they rhetoric of the
movie leaves nothing left but a political agenda. Yet, it doesn&#8217;t
articulate what the agenda is.</p>

<p>The movie is good for making it possible to think of it like this,
but it is bad because by not answering these questions, it is
incoherent and vapid.</p>
