  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved&#8212;I don&#8217;t know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I&#8217;ve played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear doing it
all over again I don&#8217;t think. At least not right away, I&#8217;ll try
again tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.</p>

<p>First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn&#8217;t unbearable, but it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad &#8220;dead
eye&#8221; syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren&#8217;t great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.</p>

<p>Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.</p>

<p>On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can&#8217;t actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it&#8217;s a strategy
game where positioning isn&#8217;t directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.</p>

<p>On another level, it&#8217;s kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select &#8220;Attack&#8221;, &#8220;Magic&#8221;, or &#8220;Item&#8221; and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey&#8217;s) sometimes during them. Except that you don&#8217;t
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don&#8217;t actually choose
which skills you will use, like &#8220;Magic > Fire&#8221;, you just choose
&#8220;Magic&#8221;. Except that all your skills aren&#8217;t always available, for
example, you can only choose &#8220;Heal&#8221; when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.</p>

<p>It is really strange.</p>

<p>Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven&#8217;t
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles (&#8220;Press A to Win&#8221;-style). Tomorrow
I&#8217;ll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I plan on starting this game today. I thought I&#8217;d write about my
expectations before I played it.</p>

<p>Like Blue Dragon, I&#8217;d heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;next gen&#8221; games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I&#8217;ve heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don&#8217;t
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I&#8217;ve
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don&#8217;t really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.</p>

<p>I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I&#8217;m skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m pretty excited about seeing what it is like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the rest of the game&#8230; meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn&#8217;t particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn&#8217;t really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn&#8217;t anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn&#8217;t dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There&#8217;s one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can&#8217;t survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second Kurosawa film that I&#8217;ve seen. I thought it was
done very well and the story was incredibly interesting, but
definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
&#8220;psychedelic&#8221; scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I finished getting As or above on every event in Pac-Man CE
DX. My ranking across the whole game is 5,100/245,281 or in the
top 2.07%. It&#8217;s a really fun game. I think I like the normal mode
the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it&#8217;s too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I&#8217;m now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I&#8217;ll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene&#8217;s fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight&#8230; wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don&#8217;t think I would have really minded too
much&#8230; unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42&#8230; which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I&#8217;m liking Maru more and more. He&#8217;s so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene&#8217;s mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He&#8217;s not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they&#8217;ll get them
back and save the day&#8230; but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>
