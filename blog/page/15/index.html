  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started reading this before going to LA with Ayame in 2012/01
(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.</p>

<p>My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.</p>

<p>I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
&#8220;action&#8221;, but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That&#8217;s
what I like most about it&#8230; you feel like you are there and they
are real.</p>

<p>I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else&#8217;s income and how public it is. I don&#8217;t think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really great closing to the rebellion. I liked that
Gaius seemed to recognize the importance of his religious role. I
hope this will be a sign that he will take it more seriously, and
perhaps that it will signify the next plot arc in the show. It
was also interesting that Tory seemed to be in charge of the
Cylons, presumably because she is one of the Five, so they
respect her, and she embraces her Cylon nature. It is also
interesting that Tyrell basically saved the fleet. I hope that
Laura realizes it is basically her fault that this happened
because she refused her responsibilities as President. I was also
reminded in this episode that nothing really ever came of the
mutiny on the Demetrius. Strange.</p>

think I really had other time to play the game anyways, so it
isn&#8217;t really a big deal. [038:33:40 Frags 103/160 Lvl 419]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had a successful run at the slot machines, I went from
2,781 tokens to 4,361 tokens. I tried a few more times later in
the day, but haven&#8217;t made any progress yet. Wow! I got two
<em>REDACTED</em>pots in Super Victory Mode! Now I have 12,556 tokens. Going
into to Super Victory Mode for one round is depressing. I&#8217;m going
to leave it playing the slots during the night to see if in the
long-run I can come out ahead. [ed: Upon waking up&#8230; 1 token.]

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Webisodes were kinda strange.</p>

<p>I knew it! The 13th tribe were totally Cylons! I wonder if Kara
is an Earthling, but there&#8217;s a difference between Earth Cylons
and Earth Cylons who are part of the 12 Cylons&#8230; like they were
the ones who started the Colonial Cylon society but were a
relatively small part of the rest of the Cylons there. And
perhaps the 5 who left the 7 abandoned the original plan and went
to live with the humans casually. I think something like could
explain how Kara and Ellen could both be Cylon-like.</p>

<p>They really threw a wrench in my expectations for the
show&#8230; awesome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found another random fragment in New Bodhum 700 AF. I find it
very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem
totally hidden&#8230; like I can&#8217;t really find them until something in
the game changes&#8230; like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don&#8217;t like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh&#8217;s appearance is pretty funny. Hope&#8217;s
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn&#8217;t get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can&#8217;t make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) &#8211; bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can&#8217;t just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah&#8217;s earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending&#8230; Lightning on
the goddess Etro&#8217;s throne looked wicked cool though. &#8220;To Be
Continued&#8221;? FF13-3? Or just one of the other endings? I don&#8217;t
understand what the Paradox Scope will do&#8230; should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each
gate that has free fragments. [036:33:45 Frags 102/160 Lvl 418]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was another really intense sequence of episodes. I thought
Lee becoming president was incredibly predictable. I can&#8217;t
believe Sol was shacking up with Caprica Six&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe
she was shacking with him; I hope she was using him for some
reason. The episode from the Cylon perspective was cool. I loved
Gaius talking to the Centurian. I still think it was horribly
wrong to destroy the resurrection hub. The revelation of who the
Four were, etc was really cool; especially how quickly Tory was
able to get over to the ship without people realizing. Getting to
Earth was super epic&#8230; having it be destroyed was also super
epic. As we were seeing Earth, <em>REDACTED</em> was like &#8220;What could they do
now?&#8221; Well, now we know.</p>

<p>I expect that the humanoid Cylons are really the 13th tribe, or
at least the creators/creations of them or something like that.</p>
