  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)</p>

<p>First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard&#8212;the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no &#8220;Game Over if Spotted&#8221; mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.</p>

<p>After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:</p>

<p>Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I didn&#8217;t make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I&#8217;m proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that&#8217;s attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.</p>

<p>Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP</p>

<p>I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.</p>

<p>Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP</p>

<p>I think I bought a shotgun or something.</p>

<p>Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 64 (30 more)
Current Drebin Points: 153,021DP</p>

<p>At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.</p>

<p>Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 46 (15 more)
Alert Phases: 89 (8 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 81 (17 more)
Weapon Types Procured: 37
Flashbacks Watched: 214
Special Items Used: Not Used
Current Drebin Points: 332,947DP
Code Name: &#8220;Pigeon&#8221;
Other titles: Inchworm, Hyena, Pig, Leopard</p>

<p>I used more continues in the final stage than any other.</p>

<p>One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.</p>

<p>In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn&#8217;t grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn&#8217;t hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn&#8217;t get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)</p>

<p>In the story department, this game is a winner.</p>

<p>All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.</p>

<p>The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.</p>

<p>The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.</p>

<p>There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.</p>

<p>I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.</p>

<p>The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.</p>

<p>my wife&#8217;s comment: People&#8217;s butts in this game look weird.</p>

<p>In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone&#8217;s toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.</p>

<p>The credits music is beautiful.</p>

<p>It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Desktop Dungeons every few days for about two
months. I was able to get through the normal mode easily with the
Fighter and the advanced version of the Fighter, but I haven&#8217;t
been able to with any other classes&#8212;I&#8217;ve tried the next Fighter
and the Thief, mainly the Thief. I feel like the game&#8217;s random
creation engine is flawed and creates un-beatable dungeons. For
example, in the last one I did, I beat every enemy and was only
level 8, but the boss is always level 10 and indestructible. I&#8217;ve
decided to stop playing because of this&#8230; I gave it many chances,
but every play session is becoming too rote. Initially, I thought
it was very cool because it flet like a roguelike, but was very
bite-sized. I think the idea is still good, but needs to be
refined.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the Metal Gear Solid 2: Digital Graphic Novel. It was
really cool. The changed the flow of the story a lot and a lot of
the details for the adventure, but it got to the same place. It
was neat, and a good reminder before playing MGS4 (which I am
doing right now.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.</p>

<p>I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.</p>

<p>In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.</p>

<p>The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.</p>

<p>The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don&#8217;t feel
like it was a cop-out.</p>

<p>The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.</p>

<p>Great game!</p>

<p>Stats:
Difficulty: Easy
Play Time: 11:25
Times Saved: 8
Restarts: 18
Times Alert Mode Triggered: 76
Humans Killed: 41
Comrades Secured: 53
Comrades Killed: 16
Codename: Scorpion</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.</p>

<p>It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn&#8217;t interested in doing more.</p>

<p>I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don&#8217;t really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I&#8217;ve thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.</p>

<p>Another bad shmup for all the typical reasons. It is absurdly cute
though. I may want to try to play it again just from its
cuteness. Probably not though&#8230; not enough time to play games
that aren&#8217;t amazing.</p>

<p>This is a hori-shmup. I played it for about 30 minutes, but really
didn&#8217;t like it. It had a lot of problems I find in other non-CAVE,
non-Treasure games: slippery controls, invisible bullets, and
weird hitboxes. I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>
