  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Zelda II: The Adventure of Link over a few
nights. The first night I got familiar with the game and leveled a
bit. The next night I beat the first palace and explored up to the
second palace. I didn&#8217;t play for a while and then I played again
tonight. I played through to the sixth palace and got to the
boss. I died in my first fight with the boss and decided to put
the game down for the night. However, when I reset the cart so
that I could save the SRAM on my PowerPak it said that there was a
fatal error and I couldn&#8217;t backup the SRAM. When I turned it back
on, I had lost my save data.</p>

<p>I had one boss and the last dungeon between me and the end of the
game. I declare it a draw. Maybe I&#8217;ll try again some day, but it
is so debilitating to have to redo so much.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember playing this game as much as the first Zelda when
I was younger. I remember the first palace and the general style
of the game very much, but I don&#8217;t remember making a lot of
progress or being very attached to it. When I played through this
time, I thought it was fun.</p>

<p>It has a reputation for being very difficult. I thought it was
about the same difficulty, but there were some things that were
different enough to feel harder. For example, after losing all
your lives, you don&#8217;t continue at the place where you are, you go
back to the start of the whole game and it may be a long walk
back. This feels quite frustrating. Another thing is that a lot of
the enemies are cheap NES mobs that soak up a lot of damage and
seem impossible to every really connect with (the many shield
enemies are like this.) Finally, there are
Castlevania-Medusea-esque floating heads that knock you off a jump
when you are going over lava pits. Arrggh. There are some things
that seem easier, like the opportunity to level and cast spells
and that you can easily get all your health/magic back outside a
dungeon.</p>

<p>I definitely enjoyed the game and it will be on my long-run
rotation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>my wife got me Resonance of Fate for the PS3 for my birthday, but I
didn&#8217;t start playing it until the beginning of August.</p>

<h1>Play details</h1>

<p>I played it pretty much every day in August, when it was my main
game, but by the end of August, I was getting a bit tired of it. I
did every thing that was possible to do in the game as I played:
all the extra missions, challenge fights, and going to the Arena
occasionally. Eventually, the grind wore down on me quite a bit. I
stopped doing the challenge fights in chapter 10 and then in
chapter 12 I decided to stop doing the extra missions. This was
after 38.5 hours of playing the game. At that point, I rushed to
the end, but when I got to chapter 14, I couldn&#8217;t get past the
first room of the story mission dungeon. I realized I wouldn&#8217;t be
able to do, so I went back to my chapter 12 save and just played
for a very short time (about 1 battle or 1 mission) every day. It
took me until yesterday to get to the last dungeon and I decided
to push on through to the end of the game.</p>

<p>In the end, I played for 54 hours. Vashyron was level 76
(30+28+18), Zephyr was level 86 (27+35+24), and Leanne was level 3
(32+27+24). I definitely will not do all the Arena ranks or play
through the secret Neverland dungeon.</p>

<h1>Story</h1>

<p>I found the story of the game to be really intriguing. The world
is very different than most games and I like the way that there
isn&#8217;t a lot of exposition in the game. Instead, you are just
normal-ish people in the world and things gradually unfold. Most
cut-scenes are less than two minutes long it seems. Some cut
scenes are hilarious and some are really fascinating and
cool. However, after you get to level 10 or so and you realize
that the game must almost be over, it is really weird that it
seems like nothing really happened. It&#8217;s just mild character
development. Even when the game was over, I said to myself, &#8220;What
even happened in this game?&#8221; I read the Wikipedia page about the
game and then all the dots connected. The story in the game is
intriguing and vague; the story in the Wikipedia page is
fascinating&#8230; I just wish it were in the game.</p>

<h1>Style</h1>

<p>The characters and world exude &#8220;style&#8221;. I love the dress-up
mini-game and I bought lots of different clothes until I found an
outfit for each character I really liked. I dressed Leanne with
black glasses, a black tight sweater, a pink knee-length skirt,
and tall white boots with a big bow on the laces so they looked
like  knee-ish high socks. I dressed Vash in jeans and a cool
white Resonance of Fate jacket. I dressed Zephyr in a dark
green-ish suit with a red undershirt.</p>

<p>The style really comes to a head in the battle system. It feels
exactly like a John Woo movie.</p>

<p>The Christmas segment&#8230; including the costumes&#8230; is insane.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe tri-Ace&#8230; which I think of as a very small
company&#8230; could make such a beautiful game.</p>

<h1>Mechanics</h1>

<p>The most important part of a game to me is its mechanics. In RoF,
there are a few systems.</p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s the world map. It is basically a board game where
you are unlocking pieces of the world with Tetris-like jigsaw
pieces you get from battles. You can only go places you unlock and
by unlocking places you gain other rewards such as items or
effects in battle. It is neat and totally unnecessary (for the
rest of the game to work), but I enjoy it, so it is a welcome
addition.</p>

<p>Second, there&#8217;s the gun customization and item synthesize
systems. The game&#8217;s combat is gun-based and you can customize your
guns with additional parts like barrels, scopes, magazines,
etc. There are like 5 attributes that you can enhance. I have no
idea what these attributes actually do, despite having played
through the whole game and spent a lot of time customizing. The
system works by laying out the extra parts in a 2D grid where they
must connect in appropriate ways (empty circle attaches to full
circle, empty square to full square, etc) to each other and
ultimately to the gun. It is fun to make ridiculous looking guns,
but I don&#8217;t feel I really understood it enough to do it well. The
item synthesis is a corollary to this system because you can build
parts (and accessories, grenades, and bullets) with it. I don&#8217;t
think I mastered (or needed to master) either system, but I did
use and have fun with them.</p>

<p>Third, there&#8217;s the progression system. Each character has three
levels that are summed to get their total level. There&#8217;s one level
per type of weapon&#8212;hand gun, machine gun, and thrown
weapon. Gaining levels gives you abilities when using that weapon,
like 10% damage increase, etc. I didn&#8217;t focus each
character. Instead, I constantly rotated weapons around (you gain
levels in the weapons you use) to the weak character with that
weapon to boost their total level. Gaining total levels gives you
health and weight capacity (did I mention guns, accessories, and
their parts have weights?) I wonder if it would have been better
to focus each character.</p>

<p>Fourth, and biggest, there&#8217;s the combat system. It is incredibly
complicated to explain, but very simple once you understand
it. The fundamental principle is that you can do a lot of blue
damage and very little red damage and only red damage kills
guys. However, if someone has 100 points of blue damage and you do
1 point of red damage, then the blue converts to red and you just
did 101 points of red damage. Everything in combat is about
filling up blue damage and then doing a little red
damage. However, there are many subtleties.</p>

<p>The most basic is that the angle you are firing at the enemy
matters and many enemies have shields that absorb fire from one
direction. The next is that blue damage recovers over time, so you
want to focus. The next is that you charge shots faster the closer
you are to the enemy. The next is that blue damage on you does not
turn into red damage, but instead when it fills up your whole life
gauge takes away 1 Hero point for every 1000 hit points. But
what&#8217;s a hero point?</p>

<p>In this game, you can either stand still, charge and fire once, or
you can run past an enemy (jumping through the air and sliding on
the ground) and fire many times. When you make a run, you use a
Hero Point. You need to do this to make enough attacks. If you
ever run out of Hero Points, the next time your HP fills up blue,
you&#8217;ll die, but you&#8217;ll die anyways because you can&#8217;t do these
runs. There&#8217;s another subtlety though. If you run across the line
made by the other two characters, it gives you a Resonance Point,
which you can convert to one cycle of a tri-Attack where each
character makes a Hero Run to the point where the next character
is standing. During a tri-Attack, any enemy inside the triangle
cannot move or have their blue damage healed.</p>

<p>The trick to this system is that there is only one strategy: Have
each character make a hero run across the line of the other
characters such that they go really close to the enemy and end up
on the other side. Do this twice to set up a tri-Attack with a big
triangle. Then do it again. This technique wins every single
battle. The only thing you ever need to do in addition is
sometimes use grenades to cause area damage or wear the right
status-effect protection accessory.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the game (probably the first 20 hours), this
system feels really cool and neat every time. It is definitely fun
and original. However, after a while, you realize that it is just
like Sudoku. Every Sudoku board is the same because your strategy
is always the same. What you are doing is always the same. In
contrast, even though you can describe FF13 or Bayonetta in a
reductionist way&#8212;increase stress and then do damage OR do combos
and then do torture attacks&#8212;-how you do that is different in
every situation. In RoF, it&#8217;s the same. It doesn&#8217;t exactly get
boring, but it loses its challenge.</p>

<p>The worst part, however, about the combat system is that it feels
a little too random sometimes. As mentioned before, there&#8217;s just
one strategy I used. But I still often needed to make the attempt
to beat a boss three or four times in sequence before winning. The
only thing that separated one attempt from another were random
factors like causing a break, getting pushed a little bit by fire,
or getting a full scratch, or something. It doesn&#8217;t seem right
that a random flip will make me go from utter defeat to utter
dominance. It seems like a random factor should make a small
difference, not a big one. This suggests to me that the game
really doesn&#8217;t require much skill if I could never recover from
little flips like that.</p>

<p>A related problem is that it never feels like there is anything
you can do to make your characters better or more
powerful. Gaining levels, getting gun upgrades, etc don&#8217;t seem to
make any difference on your play. I&#8217;m sure they do something but
it is so gradual they you never feel like you&#8217;ve reached a
new plateau where you can look down at where you were
and say you rock. There&#8217;s nothing technically wrong with this, but
it doesn&#8217;t give me the feeling I want.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>I was looking forward to this game because I&#8217;ve enjoyed every game
that tri-Ace has released that I&#8217;ve played. (I think I have missed
two games.) And when it was first coming out, I heard lots of fun
conversations about its crazy battle system. I wasn&#8217;t let down by
the game, but I don&#8217;t think this game will be as lasting to me as
Valkyrie Profile or Star Ocean 3 are. Overall, I recommend the
game. If you aren&#8217;t super hardcore like me, maybe it would better
to have an easy mode, but I don&#8217;t think one exists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Bubble Bobble on the NES. It took about four
days: the first three days I did about 30 levels each and then I
did the rest and the boss on the last day. I had my wife help me for
the boss, so I could get a good 2-player ending.</p>

<p>I love this game. I remember playing it sooo many times with my
brother as a kid. It&#8217;s really great. I don&#8217;t remember some of the
levels being so hard and I don&#8217;t remember ever beating the boss,
although I get the impression that I did.</p>

<p>It felt very good to conquer this game. I highly recommend it to
everyone. I&#8217;m looking forward to playing it with the <em>REDACTED</em> and the
Peach when they are older.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Excitebike on the NES. I considered it
completed when I placed in the top three in each race.</p>

<p>I remember playing this a lot as a kid, although when I was young
I would mostly make tracks with tons and tons of jumps, rather
than actually playing the races. In fact, when I started to play
recently I didn&#8217;t even know about the two different acceleration
buttons, although I quickly figured it out and did okay.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pretty fun game, but I like modern racing games better. In
a lot of cases (i.e. sports games) I like the older, more abstract
games better, but in this case I think that it is a bit too
simplistic for my current tastes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metroid over the past few days. (I started on the
10th, got the majority of the items and killed Kraid. Then the
next day I got two missile tanks and got to Ridley&#8217;s zone. Then
today I finished Ridley&#8217;s zone and finished the game.)</p>

<p>This is another game that I remember very fondly as a kid. I
remember using my dad&#8217;s maps and playing through it a lot, and
then discovering the JUSTIN BAILEY code and using it a lot too. I
don&#8217;t remember ever beating it though, or even really doing very
good or getting very far.</p>

<p>I think the problem when I was young is that I didn&#8217;t have the
patience to grind out health to refill all the tanks that I got;
whereas playing through the game this time, I spent a lot of time
doing that to be prepared for the enemies. If you are willing to
do that, the game gets a lot easier.</p>

<p>The final area with the Metroids and Mother Brain is brutal
though. Much much harder than any other part of the game. The
Metroids practically instantly kill you if they catch you. I had
to play through it quite a few times.</p>

<p>Overall, this game totally survived replaying and remains as
awesome in my mind as I&#8217;ve always thought.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley&#8217;s Castle
today.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don&#8217;t
remember ever getting to Wiley&#8217;s Castle, and especially not
through it. I&#8217;m kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don&#8217;t normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I&#8217;m just remembering it being harder than
it was? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man&#8217;s
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s anything that isn&#8217;t polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.</p>

<p>This game is amazing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played The Legend of Zelda on my AV Famicom with a RetroZone
PowerPak. It was awesome.</p>

<p>I started on Monday and played for about an hour while the <em>REDACTED</em>
was asleep. I got to the 2nd Dungeon, but got my butt kicked
pretty bad. I played yesterday and spent a lot of time in the
beginning crawling the map buying everything and finding all the
heart containers I could, then I got up to the 6th Dungeon in a
few hours. Today, I took it the rest of the way. I found the 6th
Dungeon to be very hard. I was able to complete the last dungeon
with two visits: the first one got me all the items and got me
familiar with the layout, but when I got to Ganon, I died, because
I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try&#8212;I only
used one potion too.</p>

<p>I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn&#8217;t shoot arrows (they consume money.)</p>

<p>It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don&#8217;t remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad&#8217;s map.</p>

<p>I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult&#8212;much more so than modern Zelda games&#8212;but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn&#8217;t
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I&#8217;ve been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I&#8217;ve been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.</p>

<p>I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don&#8217;t like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it&#8217;s pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the depth I&#8217;d like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.</p>

<p>The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It&#8217;s simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there&#8217;s no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn&#8217;t play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn&#8217;t totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.</p>

<p>Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don&#8217;t
need it.</p>

<p>The most appropriate word for this game is &#8220;fantastic&#8221; in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.</p>

<p>The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you&#8217;ve
seen or thought of before and doesn&#8217;t really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels&#8217; tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you&#8217;re walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It&#8217;s
really quite amazing.</p>

<p>What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It&#8217;s very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.</p>

<p>The story is baffling. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it&#8217;s baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There&#8217;s something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.</p>

<p>When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don&#8217;t think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don&#8217;t feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a must player.</p>

<p>Best Reader: YOU</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/">JC Fletcher&#8217;s review</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet.&#8221; and &#8220;If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing &#8230; your dream has been
fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
