  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy. I found out about
the game through <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/2007/02/best-undiscovered-neo-geo-games.html">Racketboy&#8217;s Undiscovered Neo-Geo Games</a> list.</p>

<p>The game is a side-scrolling action game with two planes of
movement. You can jump from one plane to the other and most of the
action in the game revolves around quickly and accurately getting
on the correct plane. Even though there is jumping, this isn&#8217;t
really a platforming game, because it stays on one path mostly and
there are rarely obstacles to jump over. There are four
worlds&#8212;each with two levels, one mid-boss, and one main boss;
followed by a final level with only a boss&#8212;which is actually a
six boss rush.</p>

<p>There are some interesting mechanics in the game. You can grab
things from a distance by stretching your arm. This allows you to
grab things from far away, as well as punch from a distance. Most
of the &#8220;puzzles&#8221; are about doing this effectively. There is a very
low time limit on the game and there are items that allow increase
it by 5, 10, or 20 seconds. I thought this would be stressful, but
I didn&#8217;t notice it at all. (That might have been because I
credit-fed.)</p>

<p>The animation is not nearly as good as Metal Slug, but it is
decent. There is a little bit of quirkiness. For example, there is
a funny animal in the final stage&#8230; the enemies will often wave
white flags at you&#8230; etc. There are some good details too: for
example, most vehicles are destructible and you can throw their
parts at the enemies once they are destroyed.</p>

<p>Overall, the game had a very basic and repetitive design. Most of
the enemies and bosses were dealt with in the same way. I didn&#8217;t
feel it was very deep. I could imagine feeling it was a bit deeper
if I restricted my credit usage. I would typically use 2 on a boss
and .5 on a level. I assume that most of the challenge of getting
credit usage down would be very much luck: enemies hit for a
lot.</p>

<p>I played through it in under an hour. I&#8217;d say it was worth
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I&#8217;m a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I&#8217;d never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It&#8217;s really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335">This review</a> of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn&#8217;t do better. Check that out.</p>

<p>When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, &#8220;This looks
cool.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good sign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few nights, I&#8217;ve played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren&#8217;t done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren&#8217;t displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I&#8217;m not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I&#8217;ve seen, it isn&#8217;t Treasure&#8217;s best work, but I&#8217;m glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I&#8217;d never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.</p>

<p>I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn&#8217;t
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)</p>

<p>I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven&#8217;t played a game for so long in a while.</p>

<p>I really liked the way understanding your enemy&#8217;s weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would&#8217;ve preferred.</p>

<p>I played as the Male main character. I&#8217;d like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I&#8217;d also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it&#8217;s fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC &#8220;Buffy
Summers&#8221;. =)</p>

<p>I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.</p>

<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I finished Demon&#8217;s Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.</p>

<p>I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.</p>

<p>This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you&#8217;ve &#8220;spent&#8221; the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<p>A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how &#8220;unforgiving&#8221;, or how there is no &#8220;hand-holding&#8221;. I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I&#8217;m not sure what hand-holding I would&#8217;ve wanted&#8212;there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you&#8217;ll never be caught off guard. So many &#8220;action RPGs&#8221;
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon&#8217;s Souls just requires caution and care.</p>

<p>So, Demon&#8217;s Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it&#8217;s a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.</p>

<p>As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;. In those games, you can&#8217;t &#8220;spoil&#8221; the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon&#8217;s Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it&#8217;s not really significant. I liked that
about it.</p>

<p>My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 1-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I&#8217;d have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.</p>

<p>After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote&#8212;I didn&#8217;t really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I&#8217;d have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.</p>

<p>I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;d be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would&#8217;ve just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;bug&#8221; I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.</p>

<p>Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight</p>

<p>Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7</p>

<p>Soul Level: 91</p>

<p>Throughout the game I used this equipment:</p>

<p>Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow</p>

<p>This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it&#8217;s just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For approximately the last year, I&#8217;ve been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a &#8220;Perfect&#8221; score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.</p>

<p>I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I started playing Darksiders.</p>

<p>I was interested in the game because Vinny on the Giantbomb
cast was really into it and it sounded neat. I liked the idea of a
non-Nintendo Zelda game that focused a bit more on combat.</p>

<p>However, I didn&#8217;t finish the game and I&#8217;m selling it because it
really didn&#8217;t take me and I disliked it quite a bit.</p>

<p>On the first day, I was really struck by how bad the voice
acting was and how lame the story is. I think the core problem is
that it takes itself so incredibly seriously that it is so
laughable to hear gravely voices and faux &#8220;darkness&#8221;. Another
thing I noticed was that, unlike Zelda, it does a poor job at
hiding its linearity. This was a little bit aggravating and made
the world feel a lot smaller than Hyrule. The biggest problem that
I noticed the first day, though, was how weak the brawler combat
was. It was a strange mixture between to easy (X X X X X B X X X Y
Y Y repeat) and to hard (the defense capabilities are almost
totally inadequate because of the input lag and weird hitboxes.)
Now, Zelda doesn&#8217;t have very good combat either, but at least it
is a small part of the game. In contrast, Darksiders puts a lot of
emphasis on combat but doesn&#8217;t have an adequate system. I think I
have been forever spoiled by Bayonetta.</p>

<p>On the second day, I continued to notice the combat and
actually began to think it was properly boring. The enemies take
way too long to kill and becomes pure tedium. I did one of the
first proper dungeons and was impressed with how big it was. But
when it wasn&#8217;t clear that I hadn&#8217;t finished and area and had to
backtrack A LOT, it was annoying. I ended that day at the first
big boss battle.</p>

<p>On the third day, I finished that boss battle. Man, that was
bad. The wild camera and huge hitboxes were maximally frustrating
and I almost considered stopping then, but I wanted to get through
the boss to ensure that I was uninterested in the game and not
just frustrated by a boss.  Well, I beat it and continued with the
quest. Here&#8217;s a note I wrote: &#8220;This game is soooo tedious.&#8221; There
is this weird genre-mixing segment shortly after that boss battle
that really didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>I decided to sell the game after stopping for the night. I was
originally going to just use Amazon sales, but then I noticed I
could trade it in. Wow! Amazon Trade-In is cool!</p>

<p>Total Time: 4:31:42
Combat Time: 1:13:38
Kills: 815
Deaths: 6
Distance: 51.8 miles
Souls: 14395

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing 3D Dot Game Heroes.</p>

<p>I played for three nights. The first night I just started the
game and fooled around. The next night I got up to the Aqua temple
(7/15ths through the game). The next night (tonight) I got to the
end of the Aqua temple and the game crashed as I was leaving the
temple and I lost all my progress for the night. I do not tolerate
bugs like this, so I&#8217;m not interested in continuing the game.</p>

<p>There were some things I liked about this game: the quirky
graphics are very fun, especially the way that modern particle,
liquid, and reflection effects are used to accentuate the visuals;
the gigantic sword is cool; the core Zelda 1 gameplay is fun.</p>

<p>However, there are a few things I did not like: the movement is
not grid-based, so it is very easy to get slightly ajar from
enemies (who do move in a grid) and miss them when not powered up
despite standing in front of them; similarly, it is pretty easy to
get stuck on a corner for the same reason; the world is large (it
is the size of Zelda 3) but it feels really empty (there is a
Zelda 1 amount of stuff); and, obviously, the game breaking
bug.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve decided to drop it, I looked at the GameFAQs
page. It talks a lot about side quests and extra swords, etc, that
you can get. That sounds like it would be fun and add
replayability, but these things seem really buried in the
nose-to-the-grind-stone gameplay. I didn&#8217;t notice many hooks
during my play-through of half the game. I&#8217;m sure if the game
wasn&#8217;t broken, though, I&#8217;d want to stick around and do some of
them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.</p>

<p>After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I&#8217;d never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really played a third-person
shooter. I&#8217;ve played third-person platform games with a little
shooting&#8212;like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I&#8217;ve
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I&#8217;ve certainly never played
anything in the modern &#8220;cover-based&#8221; shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.</p>

<p>I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very &#8220;real&#8221; and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a &#8220;squad&#8221; most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn&#8217;t really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.</p>

<p>The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans&#8212;just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though&#8212;however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn&#8217;t bothered
at all.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I&#8217;m an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.</p>

<p>There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there&#8217;s a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards&#8212;as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the &#8220;cheap&#8221;
one-hit kills. For example, if you don&#8217;t destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don&#8217;t see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
&#8220;Unknown&#8221; enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack&#8212;over and
over. Yikes.</p>

<p>I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint&#8212;I
effectively &#8220;1cc&#8217;d&#8221; the game. Here are my stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77</p>

<p>I wish I could&#8217;ve kept track of the total time I played. (The
&#8220;Mission Time&#8221; is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.</p>

<p>While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don&#8217;t feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played&#8230; nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.</p>

<p>Hoorah!</p>
