  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was really surprised by the quality of this movie. I assumed that
because it didn&#8217;t star Kate Beckinsale it would be a cheap version
of the world. But actually, I think it is the best yet; although it
wouldn&#8217;t be very good without the first movie, obviously. It gives
a lot better context to the first movie and makes a lot of what
seems strange about the mythology a lot more reasonable. The story
is a lot more coherent and reasonable and the action is noticeably
slower, so you can appreciate it a bit more.</p>

<p>The development of the romance between Lucian and Sonja is totally
ignored, apart from a glance when they are kids.</p>

<p>Rhona Mitra really does look like Kate Beckinsale.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that the giant black werewolf from the first scene of the
first movie is one of Lucian&#8217;s oldest friends. A nice little nod to
people paying attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.</p>

<p>The story is getting really neat and touching. I can&#8217;t believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to &#8220;avenge&#8221; her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she&#8217;ll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&amp;D area, so I suspect that it really isn&#8217;t
that close to being done.</p>

<p>This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It&#8217;s very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a very busy but ultimately unproductive day with a lot of
wasted effort, so I played games rather later to feel some
accomplishment. I played for about 2 hours. I got through all of
chapter 11 and did the skirmish that opened up three times (Easy,
Normal, Normal)&#8230; all As (2 rounds!)&#8230; to get enough money to
buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able
to do it in 2 rounds with only 2 restarts. It was pretty cool to
have a few &#8220;stealth&#8221; levels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought that I hadn&#8217;t seen this movie, but actually I have. Given
when it came out, I think I saw it in the theatres during grad
school. I would often go to the movie theater by myself on boring
nights/afternoons.</p>

<p>I think the production quality on the movie is significantly higher
and the fights are a lot more interesting. They did a good job
introducing new characters that were different. I like the
development of the mythology. Kate Beckinsale continues to look
amazing and she seems to be wearing a slightly different cat-suit.
The monsters look a little less like Buffy villains, but still a
little bit cheesy.</p>

<p>The plot feels a lot simpler, more like a roller-coaster ride where
the characters are chased from one place to the next without much
time for mystery or real plot development. It&#8217;s a bit more of a
standard action movie in that regard, and I think it suffers
compared to the last for it. The cast of meaning characters is a
lot smaller with most (such as Corvinus and Tanis) really only have
one scene. The high point of the movie is probably the set of
flashbacks scenes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished the 10th chapter tonight&#8230; the tank battle through the
city was pretty awesome, although I didn&#8217;t understand how the
lifts would work, so I tried to bunch all the characters together
before having them ride it&#8230; but of course they went one at a
time. Very annoying. I wanted to keep playing tonight, but decided
not to. I wanted to because I&#8217;m curious about what Zaka will be
like&#8230; do I really get another vehicle? I&#8217;m running really low on
money too, so I think I need to play skirmishes a few times to get
capital to buy the rest of the available upgrades.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and &#8220;camera&#8221; changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don&#8217;t feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, because I&#8217;m willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forget why, but the other day I was reminded of this series. I
decided to start watching it, similar to how I went through the
Resident Evil movies. Like that series, I saw the first one when it
came out, but never saw the others. I remember thinking the movie
was cool and that Kate Beckinsale was amazing attractive.</p>

<p>On a second viewing, significantly older, I still think some parts
of the movie are cool. The mythology is interesting and fairly
developed. The actor of Viktor is pretty awesome; while the actor
that played Kraven was unbelievably bad. The character of Erica is
really interesting and subtle. And, yes, Kate Beckinsale is
woah&#8212;except, I don&#8217;t understand the appeal of the &#8220;cat suits&#8221;,
they make all her natural curves indistinguishable, like a running
bra or something. I don&#8217;t get it, but I guess that had to because
this movie was made to be so Matrix-y. The action sequences are
very derivative of the Matrix and pretty boring overall
actually. Lots of akimbo and chunks of buildings flying off. The
best fight is probably the very first one. Even the final fight
between Viktor and Michael is pretty meh, because Michael is so
&#8220;whatever&#8221; that it doesn&#8217;t get too exciting.</p>

<p>Definitely not a classic, but I&#8217;m interested in watching the rest
of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another three hours. Today I did a few battles and I realized what
the &#8220;reports&#8221; I&#8217;d seen showing up were&#8230; how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service&#8230; I mean, the beach vacation&#8230; one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark&#8230; which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would&#8217;ve only last one
hit&#8230; and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.</p>

<p>After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an &#8220;accurate&#8221; polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &amp;
their speed.) That would be funny.</p>

<p>Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)</p>
