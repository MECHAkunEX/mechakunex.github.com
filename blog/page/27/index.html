  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another three hours. Today I did a few battles and I realized what
the &#8220;reports&#8221; I&#8217;d seen showing up were&#8230; how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service&#8230; I mean, the beach vacation&#8230; one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark&#8230; which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would&#8217;ve only last one
hit&#8230; and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.</p>

<p>After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an &#8220;accurate&#8221; polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &amp;
their speed.) That would be funny.</p>

<p>Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This movie was really different than I thought it would be. I
expected that the end of the movie would be closer to ape dominance
and I expected that the character of Caesar would be more of a hero
for humans&#8212;kind of the only smart ape that loved humans, whereas
the other ones (like Koba) would just hate them. The movie was
pretty cool and Caesar was a great epic leader. There were lots of
really cool &#8220;A-hah!&#8221; moments of his progression that were super
satisfying. I&#8217;d like to see sequels to this made.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been plugging along in the game doing one a day. I got the
train mini-game today. It&#8217;s a neat version of the car mini-game
from the last one. The idea of dealing with multiple trains at a
time sounds like it will be challenging.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to show the wife this game and have her try it out. She
beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me
show her how it was done. She lost on the next fight but I took
the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We played three levels tonight. It was pretty fun. My wife and I
had a bit of a disagreement about what was fun about the game. She
really likes collecting everything and exploring the area, trying
to do harder things. In contrast, I find that annoying and prefer
to just go through the obstacle course as fast as possible. But,
the secret of marital bliss is she tells me what to do, and I do
it, so I repented. =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight. The story battles are
getting pretty rough and un-cheese-able, which is really fun
because it forces me to try different things. I got a really bad
score in the second woodland battle, which was kinda sad, so I did
another skirmish so I could get the XP I missed. I really enjoyed
using the tank a lot in the woodland battle though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There&#8217;s a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to &#8220;fetch questy&#8221;, but when you actually have
to remember what&#8217;s going on, it feels more real and fun. It&#8217;s an
interesting thing.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my list:
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named &#8220;Ty the
Immortal&#8221;&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t seem to land a killing hit on him&#8230; maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I&#8217;m sad I didn&#8217;t get an A
on that fight.</p>

<p>I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
&#8220;fantastical&#8221; in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It&#8217;s neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.</p>

<p>The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn&#8217;t cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn&#8217;t go to before. I like it when things like that work out.</p>
