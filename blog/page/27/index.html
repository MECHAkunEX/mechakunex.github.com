  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing this regularly for so long and I&#8217;ve never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that&#8217;s probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to retire this game for a while. I haven&#8217;t really
been playing that much even though I have it scheduled and kind of
want to. I think I need to start again from the beginning with no
assists. I only have the Endurance Races, the Formula GT races,
and the Special Events to get Golds on, but I don&#8217;t want to spend
the time on the Endurance ones and the Formula/Special events are
so technical, I think my skills just aren&#8217;t up to the task. I
think I need to re-learn to play. I&#8217;m going to put it on my
schedule to play it again in January and give it another try. I
can&#8217;t believe how much and how long I&#8217;ve played this game. It&#8217;s
sooo good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn&#8217;t have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they&#8217;re just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.</p>

<p>Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak">A great review</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was appalling! I can&#8217;t believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk&#8217;s death?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now&#8230; even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I&#8217;d like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I&#8217;m basically done with the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It&#8217;s funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There&#8217;s lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to wait around for a long time today, so I played for about
40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn&#8217;t use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn&#8217;t use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I&#8217;ll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was fun. It felt like an example of what all the episodes
will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew&#8217;s distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two and half hours tonight. I&#8217;ve been taking a
break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot&#8230; it made it more
dramatic. It&#8217;s also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I&#8217;m glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane&#8217;s voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments&#8230; it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can&#8217;t have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan&#8217;s insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>
