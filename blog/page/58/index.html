  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.</p>

<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing&#8212;I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the &#8220;Time = Progress&#8221; equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn&#8217;t worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn&#8217;t going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.</p>

<p>The character progression system was fun&#8212;on the surface&#8212;it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone&#8217;s class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn&#8217;t love it enough
to really get into that.</p>

<p>I pretty much ignored the &#8220;quests&#8221; because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn&#8217;t do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don&#8217;t
love the game, I&#8217;m not taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren&#8217;t really for the solo player I
typically am.</p>

<p>The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I&#8217;ve briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.</p>

<p>Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn&#8217;t really pay of either.</p>

<p>On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.</p>

<p>I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character&#8217;s appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It&#8217;s funny how
close it goes to the JRPG clich√© of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I&#8217;ll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I bought Sin &amp; Punishment 2, I haven&#8217;t played it
commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.</p>

<p>Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I&#8217;ve completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&amp;Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. I&#8217;ve 1CC&#8217;d every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.</p>

<p>Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&amp;Kachi. So rad.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve been playing again, I&#8217;ve thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I&#8217;ve thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.</p>

<p>It is a really remarkable game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This month I played through Final Fantasy
IV on the Super Nintendo using the Japanese release and the J2e
translation.</p>

<p>I remember loving FF4 when I was younger, but I haven&#8217;t played
it in a very long time. Back then, I remember hearing that the
Japanese version had more story scenes and a slightly different
story, due to the censorship Nintendo had at that point on the
SNES. Therefore, I was very excited to play a translation of the
Japanese version.</p>

<p>The new story is different in some subtle ways; the main change is
that there is a lot of risque humour, especially with Edge and
Palom. J2e kept &#8220;You Spoony Bard!&#8221;, which was great to
remember. Most of the spells and items seemed to be named
differently, and something else I liked a lot was that there
seemed to be no limit put on item and character name lengths,
which made for some more pleasant reading.</p>

<p>Overall, FF4 is as good as I remember. The story is
entertaining and detailed enough, for the time. The battle system
is fun&#8230; and actually it is much more brutal than I
remembered. The non-boss battles were particularly rough rather
than the normal steam-rolling fodder. The optional content is very
detailed. The characters are interesting. A subtle thing I really
enjoy is that there is no character customization: by level 38,
Rosa always learns Reflect, with no options. This kind of thing is
no longer popular, but I liked the way it ties together the
character&#8217;s personality and their battle powers. (For example,
when Rydia is encouraged by Rosa to cast a Fire spell&#8212;despite
her village being destroyed by fire&#8212;she then gains the ability
in combat as well.) Despite appearances, it actually gives you
more ability to be creative, because you have to find interesting
ways to use the abilities that you have, rather than find a boring
min-max strategy.</p>

<p>I misremembered the story a little bit, so I was pleasantly
surprised. For example, I thought that Edge would die near the end
and that FuSoYa would be in the party for the rest of the game,
but I was (obviously) wrong.</p>

<p>Definitely a great game, I think I will enjoy playing it again
in another few years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up Deathsmiles on the release date, and I&#8217;ve been playing
it every day since. Today, I&#8217;ve decided I will be putting it on my
&#8220;play once a month&#8221; rotation, rather than my &#8220;play once a day&#8221;
rotation. The occasion: 1CCs.</p>

<p>I cleared Xbox 360 mode with Rosa a while back finishing with
67,814,085 points. At the time, I was #54 out of the other Rosa
players in the same mode.</p>

<p>For a while, I worked on clearing with Casper, but only managed
to get to the second castle stage (not to the final boss) with
45,286,742 points and #29 out of Casper players. After hitting a
wall, I decided I didn&#8217;t need to clear with every character right
now and I&#8217;d rather try another mode.</p>

<p>This morning, I cleared Mega Black Label Xbox 360 mode with
Rosa with 249,250,914 points. I was #7 out of Rosa players and #26
out of all players. Yum!</p>

<p>Deathsmiles is a very cool game. I really enjoyed the last few
months of intense play and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll enjoy picking it up every
once in a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting in July, <em>REDACTED</em> and I started watching Lost. Since it had
finished, we were able to watch all the episodes with only the
delays we wanted, rather than having to wait in between
seasons&#8212;the way we like it.</p>

<p>My first experience with Lost was when I went to the graduate
school recruiting visit. Someone invited a few of us over to watch
the third or fourth episode. I wasn&#8217;t really interested at the
time, but when I think of Lost, I think of that first. I&#8217;m guessing
I would&#8217;ve been caught if I had started back then. =)</p>

<p>I liked Lost because of the interesting mythology and the detailed
characters. Lost isn&#8217;t really about the &#8220;plot&#8221; or about discovering
a &#8220;mystery&#8221;, it is really a character drama where the situations in
the show just serve to illustrate the personalities of the
characters. Of course, this standard of the drama genre gets
co-opted by the mythology to turn the whole island experience into
a kind of test for the characters. The mythology as a whole is
really interesting and fun to speculate about. Yet I wouldn&#8217;t say
that discovering it is really what the show is about, because I
don&#8217;t believe the full mythology was in the mind of the creators,
thus you can&#8217;t really call it a &#8220;mystery&#8221;, but rather an unfolding
revelation.</p>

<p>My favourite characters where Juliette, Richard, Ben, and the
Monster. Of the survivors, I thought <em>REDACTED</em> was very well developed
and Sawyer showed the most growth, which is interesting. I liked
Annalucia and Boone, though they were short lived, so they are
harder to appreciate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d definitely recommend Lost. I&#8217;m excited to read fan theories and
summaries now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through A Boy and His Blob for the Wii. I&#8217;d been
watching this game since it was announced because it was 2D,
looked beautiful, and looked really cute too.</p>

<p>When I first started playing, I was very thorough: getting
every treasure and going through every challenge level, but
eventually (as you read below) the challenge levels became
incredibly painful and I started to hate the game because of
them. After that I just raced through the game and didn&#8217;t even get
many chests in the final world.</p>

<h1>Things I loved</h1>

<p>The 2D graphics are really pretty. I like the brightness and
the fluidity of them in particular. I like that the levels reflect
what the world map implies about them and sometimes you can see
the later landmarks on the map from inside them.  For example,
seeing the tower from the middle of the final world was epic.</p>

<p>The whole style is incredibly cute and heartwarming. The boy is
the best five year old I&#8217;ve ever seen in a game and I love the hug
animation. Even the enemies are kind of pudgy and cute.</p>

<p>The vast variety of beans is very entertaining. Only a few of
them overlap in functionality, so the puzzles are not necessarily
&#8220;non-linear&#8221;, but the variety of different kinds of puzzles keeps
it fresh. I would&#8217;ve liked a mode where I could play a level with
a custom selection of beans (perhaps after I beat it or got all
the chests.)</p>

<p>The puzzles are clever enough. There are a few places where you
can really break things with creativity, but that is fun. For
example, you can get birds to hit mine blobs and just walk out of
some otherwise difficult things; the Zorb bean can survive any
fall and is invulnerable, so you can just jump in it and then jump
off a cliff rather than blob-achute down. I think the final areas
(in the castles) had the best puzzles in terms of difficulty and
interestingatude.</p>

<p>I was very surprised when I got to the first boss battle. I
thought the worked really well as multi-part puzzles. Although,
I&#8217;ll complain about them more later&#8230; that they exist is
definitely a plus.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the lack of text and the way the game
communicated to you what you were supposed to do and the
intentions of the blob, etc. This is best illustrated by the lack
of a menu. I love that you turn the game on and are almost
instantly controlling the boy.</p>

<p>MECHA BLOB!</p>

<h1>Things I hated</h1>

<p>Although the puzzles were clever and interesting, there was not
enough mystery because almost every stage has a sign instructing
you which of the four beans is the correct one to use for that
segment. This really kills a lot of the enjoyment, because you&#8217;re
not so much &#8220;solving the puzzle&#8221; as &#8220;executing the solution&#8221;. I
will complain below about the tools you have for &#8220;executing&#8221;, so
this turns out to be a big problem.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the game, the challenge levels don&#8217;t have
checkpoints. This makes playing them really jarring because it
doesn&#8217;t fit with the general feel. Since the challenge levels have
the hardest &#8220;reflex&#8221; challenges (more below), this is particularly
annoying. Some of the challenge levels are just stupid-cheap
too. For example, I quit playing them after one where you had to
drop a Trampobean down a pit and then jump hoping you landed on it
correctly. You then had to do this four more times, restarting
from the beginning when you missed. Since the beans bounce and
have physics applied to them, it is frustrating and unsatisfying
to make the jump correctly.</p>

<p>There are a few annoying bugs. Level 4-1 sticks in my mind
because you don&#8217;t have the blob with you, so he doesn&#8217;t eat the
chests. Instead, you drop them into the ground level where the
blob will get them later. I dropped every chest and made it to the
next checkpoint, yet only two chests were there at the
end. Arggh.</p>

<h1>The biggest most &#8220;shoot myself in the face&#8221; problem</h1>

<p>The controls are unimaginably bad. They are sluggish and
inaccurate. It is like trying to push an anvil with a wet
noodle. I&#8217;ve read the developers talk about how this is partly
because the boy is supposed to be a clumsy kid but that seems like
a total cop-out. This just plain sucks. I think the sluggish-ness
would not be as bad if you could use the D-pad to control the boy,
but even on the Classic controller (where most buttons duplicate
what another button does), you cannot. This is especially dumb
because the game is 2D.</p>

<p>In general, this horrible control would be much more passable
if the game did not require reflexes. Yet, there are many reflex
sections that require exact platforming control yet the mechanics
do not give the ability to do it. I don&#8217;t mind restarting levels,
etc (I play shmups after all), but that&#8217;s because the games I play
that require that always make clear that it is /your fault/
when you die and it never feels like the game&#8217;s fault. I can
honestly say that almost all the time, I felt like I was dying
because the controls were so bad. There is nothing more
frustrating than this.</p>

<p>The bad controls are made worse by some of the custom bean
controls. The Zorb, Rocket, and Bouncer are the biggest offenders,
because they are the most mobile beans. The Blobachute is bad
too.</p>

<p>This problem is why the challenge levels were so bad. They were
almost all reflex based and had a higher than normal restart
penalty. The bosses were frustrating for the same reason. The
third boss was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I
wanted to blow my brains out. Ugh.</p>

<h1>The verdict</h1>

<p>This is a good game, but not a classic. I only want to play
classics. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be playing this much more, but if I
have a young friend in the near future I may point them at this or
donate the game to them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.</p>

<p>I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).</p>

<p>I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.</p>

<p>I like the art style.</p>

<p>I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: &#8220;There is a dungeon
outside the town.&#8221;), it&#8217;s natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn&#8217;t often that I could &#8220;phone it in&#8221; and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.</p>

<p>I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you&#8217;re
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can&#8217;t defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)</p>

<p>I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)</p>

<h1>Things I didn&#8217;t like</h1>

<p>The mapping system isn&#8217;t advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something&#8212;like the link between a
portal&#8217;s entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way&#8212;where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn&#8217;t be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.</p>

<p>The character customization didn&#8217;t have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn&#8217;t upgrade everything (there just aren&#8217;t enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.</p>

<p>I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn&#8217;t bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst
enemy and I wasn&#8217;t making enough improvement after a few weeks of
sporadic play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Bayonetta for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>This game is insane. The craziness of the situations Bayonetta
is in is truly ridiculous. One of my favourite parts is when you
are falling out of an airplane&#8217;s cargo bay, so you stop time and
jump up the falling crates. Awesome. The fights are insane. The
climax finishes are equally ridiculous. The attention to detail is
really stellar too. The gameplay is intense. Oh man. This game is
great.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the soundtrack, especially the theme song and
the rendition of &#8220;Fly Me to the Moon&#8221;.</p>

<p>I played through on Normal, then Very Easy, then Easy, then
Hard (finished in under 3 hours), then Non-Stop Infinite Climax
(the hardest difficulty, crazy name huh?) (finished in 3 hours, 4
minutes.) I ended up playing the game for a total of 33 hours, 50
minutes, and 45 seconds. I unlocked everything (except Sai-Fon),
got almost all the achievements, tried out the extra characters,
etc. I didn&#8217;t like playing with the extra characters or the extra
costumes as much because the detail just wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>The main thing I disliked about the game was the
&#8220;mini-games&#8221;. For example, there is a shooting gallery game, a
racing level, and a Space Harrier-like level. These introduce
totally new control schemes and don&#8217;t have the polish of the
overall game. Unlike Treasure, who takes the same mechanics and
control and puts them in a different genre, Platinum Games just
implemented a whole other game and put it inside Bayonetta. I
especially dislike the Space Harrier level.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/09/09/10-video-games-that-should-be-comics/">description of Bayonetta</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t played it, Bayonetta is the story of<br/>a bespectacled witch who straps guns to her feet so that she can<br/>kick people in the face while she&#8217;s shooting them in the face at<br/>the same time, and the better she fights, the more naked she<br/>gets. Oh, and also, she kills angels with a zeal that makes her a<br/>pretty close equivalent to a sexy female version of Ronnie James<br/>Dio. In other words, she&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d get if you went back<br/>in time and told fourteen year-old me to imagine best thing<br/>ever.</p></blockquote>


<p>Finally, a little comment on the M rating. I generally don&#8217;t
play M rated games because I don&#8217;t want to see extreme violence,
hear nasty language, or see pornography. The violence in Bayonetta
doesn&#8217;t bother me because the enemies are so inhuman (and the
humans, including Bayonetta herself, bleed e.g. rose petals); for
the large grotesque monsters the blood and gore doesn&#8217;t even feel
like gore. It looks like they&#8217;re spewing lava or something. I
thought the language in Bayonetta was bad, especially one
particular character (the Italian stooge.) I was initially
impressed that Bayonetta herself never used bad language, but she
once says the F word. It sounds really out of character because
she&#8217;s normally so sophisticated. I didn&#8217;t like that and it&#8217;s one
reason I never watched cut-scenes after the first
play-through. Finally, the pornography side. In my opinion,
Bayonetta is actually quite tame compared to many modern
games. Bayonetta replaces titillating graphic nudity with a
general sexual tone and flashes of partial nudity. This playful
PG-13-ness makes me grin and laugh at the craziness, rather than
be offended. I&#8217;m sure others would disagree, but that&#8217;s how I
feel. It definitely doesn&#8217;t pass the &#8220;Would I want my 13 year old
son to play it?&#8221; test, but I wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed if my college age
child did.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was really impressed by this game. I recommend
it. Play with the volume low in the cutscenes or just skip (the
story is only good for its insanity) if your ears are like
mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.</p>

<p>We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn&#8217;t stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we&#8217;ve completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.</p>

<p>The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I&#8217;m a major
opponent of innovation for innovation&#8217;s sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.</p>

<p>This game is FUN. I can&#8217;t wait to play with the <em>REDACTED</em> and his
sister (We haven&#8217;t decided on her pseudonym yet.)</p>
