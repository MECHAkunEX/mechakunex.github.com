  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Webisodes were kinda strange.</p>

<p>I knew it! The 13th tribe were totally Cylons! I wonder if Kara
is an Earthling, but there&#8217;s a difference between Earth Cylons
and Earth Cylons who are part of the 12 Cylons&#8230; like they were
the ones who started the Colonial Cylon society but were a
relatively small part of the rest of the Cylons there. And
perhaps the 5 who left the 7 abandoned the original plan and went
to live with the humans casually. I think something like could
explain how Kara and Ellen could both be Cylon-like.</p>

<p>They really threw a wrench in my expectations for the
show&#8230; awesome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found another random fragment in New Bodhum 700 AF. I find it
very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem
totally hidden&#8230; like I can&#8217;t really find them until something in
the game changes&#8230; like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don&#8217;t like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh&#8217;s appearance is pretty funny. Hope&#8217;s
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn&#8217;t get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can&#8217;t make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) &#8211; bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can&#8217;t just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah&#8217;s earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending&#8230; Lightning on
the goddess Etro&#8217;s throne looked wicked cool though. &#8220;To Be
Continued&#8221;? FF13-3? Or just one of the other endings? I don&#8217;t
understand what the Paradox Scope will do&#8230; should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each
gate that has free fragments. [036:33:45 Frags 102/160 Lvl 418]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was another really intense sequence of episodes. I thought
Lee becoming president was incredibly predictable. I can&#8217;t
believe Sol was shacking up with Caprica Six&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe
she was shacking with him; I hope she was using him for some
reason. The episode from the Cylon perspective was cool. I loved
Gaius talking to the Centurian. I still think it was horribly
wrong to destroy the resurrection hub. The revelation of who the
Four were, etc was really cool; especially how quickly Tory was
able to get over to the ship without people realizing. Getting to
Earth was super epic&#8230; having it be destroyed was also super
epic. As we were seeing Earth, <em>REDACTED</em> was like &#8220;What could they do
now?&#8221; Well, now we know.</p>

<p>I expect that the humanoid Cylons are really the 13th tribe, or
at least the creators/creations of them or something like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exploring 100 AF Bresha Ruins. This has been like one of two so
far missions where you have to travel to the
past/future. Actually, I&#8217;ve got to jump around quite a
bit. Something I&#8217;m not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I&#8217;ve been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM&#8230; the hover doesn&#8217;t seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting&#8230; Mog is so funny in his
opinions about humans. :) I&#8217;m running the slot machines on auto
and got three ochu! But I then lost everything in Super Victory
Mode, so I didn&#8217;t keep the save. [033:45:14 Frags 99/160 Lvl 369]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This sequence of three episodes was really intense. The mutiny
aboard the Demetrius, Gaius&#8217; monotheism, the alliance with the
Cylons, it is all incredibly fascinating. Each episode is ending
of a severe cliff-hanger, particularly the third one in this
sequence, because they jump away. Crazy.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe Athena killed the Rebel Leader.</p>

<p>Although I was impressed by the Rebel Leader&#8217;s speech to the
Quorum, I think it is wrong for the humans to take away their
resurrection ability. It is just as bad as what the Cylons did to
the humans. They need to be bigger and try to promote peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t been able to play very much the last few days, so I
wanted to do a little today. I went to the Vile Peaks, but it
appears I need to find another time of it. Then I went back to ADW
and filled out its map. I then did some rubber banding at the slot
machine. Ouch. What a waste of time. I&#8217;m appalled that the chocobo
races aren&#8217;t more productive in terms of coin
production. [031:41:19 Frags 86/160 Lvl 349]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every episode this season has been amazing. This was particularly
cool. Each of the new Cylons is having a little crisis as they
learn about themselves and how they should feel. I find Tory to
be most interesting, because she&#8217;s fully converted to the
supremacy of Cylons (and the One True God, because of Gaius.)
Lee&#8217;s character continues to be exemplary. I&#8217;m extremely
fascinated by Gaius. I loved how it looked like there was a
miracle going on when Figment Six was picking him up after he was
beat down. The thing with Caprica Six and the Colonel was super
weird though&#8230; I found Helen to look really disturbing in her
clothes for some reason&#8230; it just looked wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a crazy episode. First of all, it&#8217;s nuts what is going
on on Starbuck&#8217;s ship. She has to find Earth, but how? How long
will they be gone? Second, I&#8217;m glad Lee is so honest and a
defender of freedom and justice; however, I think that we&#8217;re
going to be told that his actions have ultimately bad
consequences because Laura is so good. Third, oh man, I can&#8217;t
believe Kali would have killed herself, or was she trying to kill
her son? And then Tori (sp?) killed her? I get the impression
that she has really embraced her Cylon side and thinks the humans
are in the wrong in a lot of ways. (I noticed that she seemed to
have Cylon strength. I hope she&#8217;ll free/connect with Caprica
Six.) And finally, it sucks what is going on with the good
Cylons. :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really intriguing episode. It&#8217;s crazy that there is
meta-reflection in the Cylon world, where they are treating the
Raiders &amp; Centurions like the Humans used to treat the
Cylons. I think the Sixes are clearly in the right, and I&#8217;m a bit
amazed that the others don&#8217;t see their hypocrisy. I was kind of
amazed that Gaius saw himself and they didn&#8217;t make any further
mention of that being strange.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is kind of crazy to go through the same areas like 4 times. The
fact that there is kind of a &#8220;hidden object&#8221; game inside this game
is strange when you reflect on it. I love my clock solver. The
dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine&#8212;would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn&#8217;t;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius&#8217; life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I&#8217;ve been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They&#8217;ve firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn&#8217;t win him as a monster? I tried Lightning &amp; Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight&#8217;s stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I&#8217;ll be put into the
end game. [030:49:01 Frags 83/160 Lvl 337]</p>
