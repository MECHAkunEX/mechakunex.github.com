  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I finished Demon&#8217;s Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.</p>

<p>I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.</p>

<p>This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you&#8217;ve &#8220;spent&#8221; the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<p>A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how &#8220;unforgiving&#8221;, or how there is no &#8220;hand-holding&#8221;. I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I&#8217;m not sure what hand-holding I would&#8217;ve wanted&#8212;there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you&#8217;ll never be caught off guard. So many &#8220;action RPGs&#8221;
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon&#8217;s Souls just requires caution and care.</p>

<p>So, Demon&#8217;s Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it&#8217;s a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.</p>

<p>As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;. In those games, you can&#8217;t &#8220;spoil&#8221; the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon&#8217;s Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it&#8217;s not really significant. I liked that
about it.</p>

<p>My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 2-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I&#8217;d have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.</p>

<p>After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote&#8212;I didn&#8217;t really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I&#8217;d have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.</p>

<p>I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;d be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would&#8217;ve just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;bug&#8221; I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.</p>

<p>Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight</p>

<p>Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7</p>

<p>Soul Level: 91</p>

<p>Throughout the game I used this equipment:</p>

<p>Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow</p>

<p>This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it&#8217;s just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For approximately the last year, I&#8217;ve been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a &#8220;Perfect&#8221; score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.</p>

<p>I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I started playing Darksiders.</p>

<p>I was interested in the game because Vinny on the Giantbomb
cast was really into it and it sounded neat. I liked the idea of a
non-Nintendo Zelda game that focused a bit more on combat.</p>

<p>However, I didn&#8217;t finish the game and I&#8217;m selling it because it
really didn&#8217;t take me and I disliked it quite a bit.</p>

<p>On the first day, I was really struck by how bad the voice
acting was and how lame the story is. I think the core problem is
that it takes itself so incredibly seriously that it is so
laughable to hear gravely voices and faux &#8220;darkness&#8221;. Another
thing I noticed was that, unlike Zelda, it does a poor job at
hiding its linearity. This was a little bit aggravating and made
the world feel a lot smaller than Hyrule. The biggest problem that
I noticed the first day, though, was how weak the brawler combat
was. It was a strange mixture between to easy (X X X X X B X X X Y
Y Y repeat) and to hard (the defense capabilities are almost
totally inadequate because of the input lag and weird hitboxes.)
Now, Zelda doesn&#8217;t have very good combat either, but at least it
is a small part of the game. In contrast, Darksiders puts a lot of
emphasis on combat but doesn&#8217;t have an adequate system. I think I
have been forever spoiled by Bayonetta.</p>

<p>On the second day, I continued to notice the combat and
actually began to think it was properly boring. The enemies take
way too long to kill and becomes pure tedium. I did one of the
first proper dungeons and was impressed with how big it was. But
when it wasn&#8217;t clear that I hadn&#8217;t finished and area and had to
backtrack A LOT, it was annoying. I ended that day at the first
big boss battle.</p>

<p>On the third day, I finished that boss battle. Man, that was
bad. The wild camera and huge hitboxes were maximally frustrating
and I almost considered stopping then, but I wanted to get through
the boss to ensure that I was uninterested in the game and not
just frustrated by a boss.  Well, I beat it and continued with the
quest. Here&#8217;s a note I wrote: &#8220;This game is soooo tedious.&#8221; There
is this weird genre-mixing segment shortly after that boss battle
that really didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>I decided to sell the game after stopping for the night. I was
originally going to just use Amazon sales, but then I noticed I
could trade it in. Wow! Amazon Trade-In is cool!</p>

<p>Total Time: 4:31:42
Combat Time: 1:13:38
Kills: 815
Deaths: 6
Distance: 51.8 miles
Souls: 14395
Combo: 30
Demon Blood: 1542.99 gallons</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing 3D Dot Game Heroes.</p>

<p>I played for three nights. The first night I just started the
game and fooled around. The next night I got up to the Aqua temple
(7/15ths through the game). The next night (tonight) I got to the
end of the Aqua temple and the game crashed as I was leaving the
temple and I lost all my progress for the night. I do not tolerate
bugs like this, so I&#8217;m not interested in continuing the game.</p>

<p>There were some things I liked about this game: the quirky
graphics are very fun, especially the way that modern particle,
liquid, and reflection effects are used to accentuate the visuals;
the gigantic sword is cool; the core Zelda 1 gameplay is fun.</p>

<p>However, there are a few things I did not like: the movement is
not grid-based, so it is very easy to get slightly ajar from
enemies (who do move in a grid) and miss them when not powered up
despite standing in front of them; similarly, it is pretty easy to
get stuck on a corner for the same reason; the world is large (it
is the size of Zelda 3) but it feels really empty (there is a
Zelda 1 amount of stuff); and, obviously, the game breaking
bug.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve decided to drop it, I looked at the GameFAQs
page. It talks a lot about side quests and extra swords, etc, that
you can get. That sounds like it would be fun and add
replayability, but these things seem really buried in the
nose-to-the-grind-stone gameplay. I didn&#8217;t notice many hooks
during my play-through of half the game. I&#8217;m sure if the game
wasn&#8217;t broken, though, I&#8217;d want to stick around and do some of
them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.</p>

<p>After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I&#8217;d never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really played a third-person
shooter. I&#8217;ve played third-person platform games with a little
shooting&#8212;like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I&#8217;ve
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I&#8217;ve certainly never played
anything in the modern &#8220;cover-based&#8221; shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.</p>

<p>I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very &#8220;real&#8221; and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a &#8220;squad&#8221; most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn&#8217;t really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.</p>

<p>The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans&#8212;just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though&#8212;however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn&#8217;t bothered
at all.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I&#8217;m an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.</p>

<p>There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there&#8217;s a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards&#8212;as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the &#8220;cheap&#8221;
one-hit kills. For example, if you don&#8217;t destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don&#8217;t see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
&#8220;Unknown&#8221; enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack&#8212;over and
over. Yikes.</p>

<p>I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint&#8212;I
effectively &#8220;1cc&#8217;d&#8221; the game. Here are my stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77</p>

<p>I wish I could&#8217;ve kept track of the total time I played. (The
&#8220;Mission Time&#8221; is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.</p>

<p>While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don&#8217;t feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played&#8230; nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.</p>

<p>Hoorah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not as complicated as the tutorial makes it seem, but still really
complicated and fun</p>

<p>The story was incomprehensible to me after about 5 scenes and it
took too long to read, so I started skipping it, but that seems
like a bad decision in retrospect.</p>

<p>It is very hard to tell how good your decisions are for the long
run</p>

<p>Some of the controls are really bad&#8212;like turning your knights</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t yet understand how height works because, for example, magic
users can&#8217;t seem to launch projectiles &#8220;down&#8221; even though that
makes sense</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.</p>

<p>My completed game save reads: &#8220;43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50&#8221;. During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.</p>

<p>As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.</p>

<p>The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
&#8220;Miss&#8221; appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of &#8220;time is frozen&#8221; style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.</p>

<p>The most amazing part of this game were the &#8220;Thousand Years of
Dreams&#8221; segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and &#8220;watch&#8221; these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those &#8220;dreams&#8221; are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby&#8217;s cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim&#8217;s character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim&#8217;s loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here&#8217;s what it said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey&#8217;s &#8220;Thousand Years of Dreams&#8221; were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game&#8217;s producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim&#8217;s backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game&#8217;s main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as &#8220;adding to the world&#8217;s supply of<br/>senseless violence,&#8221; he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being &#8220;shocked&#8221; at its pacifist message and &#8220;vivid<br/>imagery&#8221;.</p></blockquote>


<p>I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.</p>

<p>On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the &#8220;chocobo&#8221; music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.</p>

<p>The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven&#8217;t played anything with better
looking environments.</p>

<p>There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying &#8220;mini-games&#8221;: escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the &#8220;losing&#8221;
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.</p>

<p>The character models aren&#8217;t very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good&#8212;especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that&#8217;s
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It&#8217;s really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to &#8220;perfect&#8221; male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming&#8217;s body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)</p>

<p>On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.</p>

<p>On the subject of Ming&#8217;s outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=803">pictures of Ming</a> and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=803&amp;tbs=isch:1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a &#8220;wispy&#8221; and &#8220;tendrily&#8221; style about them.</p>

<p>Another graphical thing: The &#8220;liquid&#8221; in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.</p>

<p>I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.</p>

<p>I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I&#8217;d ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn&#8217;t run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn&#8217;t look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details&#8212;like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.</p>

<p>In a word, I&#8217;d call the game &#8220;meaningful&#8221;. There&#8217;s a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.</p>

<p>One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn&#8217;t be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren&#8217;t really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.</p>
