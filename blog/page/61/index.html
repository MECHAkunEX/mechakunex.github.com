  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Shoot 1UP, another game from Mommy&#8217;s Best
Games. I also beat this in one sitting on the first try. Very
easy. The gimmick of this game is that you are controlling all
your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I&#8217;d heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.</p>

<p>I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven&#8217;t
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won&#8217;t play it
again.</p>

<p>I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Explosionade, an Xbox Live Indie Game. It
was 41 levels, I played through it in about 30 minutes and did a
1CC on my first try. I didn&#8217;t find it very compelling. The
graphics were crisp and nice. It was cheap, so I&#8217;d say it was
worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Rez on the Dreamcast.</p>

<p>This is a very acclaimed game that I&#8217;ve heard a lot about. It&#8217;s
well-known for its synergy between music, sound effects, visuals,
and actions. It is a Panzer Dragoon-style rail shooter with a
trance soundtrack and trippy theme. You start exploring a computer
system, but as you progress it implies that this computer system
has somehow consumed the real world and you are freeing it and
thus recreating Earth.</p>

<p>The game has really great style and fun gameplay. I had to play
each level (of 5) twice before beating them and I played the 1st
level a third time so I could get 100% to unlock level 5. I did
this over two days. I read online that there are unlockables for
getting more perfect scores, but the gameplay didn&#8217;t compel me to
finish that part of the game.</p>

<p>This game solidifies more for me that I dislike the Dragoon-style
games, probably because I first played Sin &amp; Punishment and
like the ability to dodge too much. I find the gameplay
surprisingly shallow: the key is to chain and destroy things in
basically the order they appear on the screen.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played the game because I have more context
for thinking about games and a better understanding of the history
of this genre and a knowledge of this influential game, but I
won&#8217;t be trying to complete it 100%.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blazing Lazers a few nights ago and tonight. This
is a shooter from 1989 on the PC Engine.</p>

<p>I found the weapons to be really cool. I particularly liked the
laser beam weapon that spread into weird shapes.</p>

<p>I found the hit box really annoying. The hit box is bigger than
the ship graphic and wider than it is vertically, so it is really
difficult to dodge properly, at least when compared to the modern
danmaku shooters I normally play.</p>

<p>I used save states before and after bosses, plus throughout the
final boss battle. In fact, my wife helped me restart a million
times through a particular explosion.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the game was fun, but I like modern shooters
better. I didn&#8217;t like it as much as the shooter that is in Retro
Game Challenge, which is supposedly based on this game.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy. I found out about
the game through <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/2007/02/best-undiscovered-neo-geo-games.html">Racketboy&#8217;s Undiscovered Neo-Geo Games</a> list.</p>

<p>The game is a side-scrolling action game with two planes of
movement. You can jump from one plane to the other and most of the
action in the game revolves around quickly and accurately getting
on the correct plane. Even though there is jumping, this isn&#8217;t
really a platforming game, because it stays on one path mostly and
there are rarely obstacles to jump over. There are four
worlds&#8212;each with two levels, one mid-boss, and one main boss;
followed by a final level with only a boss&#8212;which is actually a
six boss rush.</p>

<p>There are some interesting mechanics in the game. You can grab
things from a distance by stretching your arm. This allows you to
grab things from far away, as well as punch from a distance. Most
of the &#8220;puzzles&#8221; are about doing this effectively. There is a very
low time limit on the game and there are items that allow increase
it by 5, 10, or 20 seconds. I thought this would be stressful, but
I didn&#8217;t notice it at all. (That might have been because I
credit-fed.)</p>

<p>The animation is not nearly as good as Metal Slug, but it is
decent. There is a little bit of quirkiness. For example, there is
a funny animal in the final stage&#8230; the enemies will often wave
white flags at you&#8230; etc. There are some good details too: for
example, most vehicles are destructible and you can throw their
parts at the enemies once they are destroyed.</p>

<p>Overall, the game had a very basic and repetitive design. Most of
the enemies and bosses were dealt with in the same way. I didn&#8217;t
feel it was very deep. I could imagine feeling it was a bit deeper
if I restricted my credit usage. I would typically use 2 on a boss
and .5 on a level. I assume that most of the challenge of getting
credit usage down would be very much luck: enemies hit for a
lot.</p>

<p>I played through it in under an hour. I&#8217;d say it was worth
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I&#8217;m a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I&#8217;d never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It&#8217;s really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335">This review</a> of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn&#8217;t do better. Check that out.</p>

<p>When I was playing, my wife walked in the room and said, &#8220;This looks
cool.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good sign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few nights, I&#8217;ve played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren&#8217;t done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren&#8217;t displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I&#8217;m not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I&#8217;ve seen, it isn&#8217;t Treasure&#8217;s best work, but I&#8217;m glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I&#8217;d never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.</p>

<p>I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn&#8217;t
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)</p>

<p>I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven&#8217;t played a game for so long in a while.</p>

<p>I really liked the way understanding your enemy&#8217;s weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would&#8217;ve preferred.</p>

<p>I played as the Male main character. I&#8217;d like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I&#8217;d also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it&#8217;s fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC &#8220;Buffy
Summers&#8221;. =)</p>

<p>I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.</p>

<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I finished Demon&#8217;s Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.</p>

<p>I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.</p>

<p>This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you&#8217;ve &#8220;spent&#8221; the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<p>A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how &#8220;unforgiving&#8221;, or how there is no &#8220;hand-holding&#8221;. I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I&#8217;m not sure what hand-holding I would&#8217;ve wanted&#8212;there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you&#8217;ll never be caught off guard. So many &#8220;action RPGs&#8221;
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon&#8217;s Souls just requires caution and care.</p>

<p>So, Demon&#8217;s Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it&#8217;s a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.</p>

<p>As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;. In those games, you can&#8217;t &#8220;spoil&#8221; the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon&#8217;s Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it&#8217;s not really significant. I liked that
about it.</p>

<p>My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 2-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I&#8217;d have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.</p>

<p>After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote&#8212;I didn&#8217;t really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I&#8217;d have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.</p>

<p>I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;d be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would&#8217;ve just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;bug&#8221; I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.</p>

<p>Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight</p>

<p>Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7</p>

<p>Soul Level: 91</p>

<p>Throughout the game I used this equipment:</p>

<p>Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow</p>

<p>This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it&#8217;s just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.</p>
