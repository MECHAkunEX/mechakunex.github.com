  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think my two favourite parts about this episode were the events
involving the Chief and the President.</p>

<p>I thought the Chief acted very wisely in trying to help out the
two girls, but also that he was noble in his obedience to
&#8220;soldier ethics&#8221; in regards to the Doctor&#8217;s disagreement with the
Lt. I find the command structure of the military to be
fascinating&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to be involved in it, but it&#8217;s
great.</p>

<p>The President&#8217;s little speech and revelation was pretty epic and
tough.</p>

<p>The XO is such a punk. I wonder how Adama will clean up his mess
once he wakes up. Tension.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really awesome episode. I thought they did a great job
making it really tense. I thought it was also awesome how the XO
knew what the goal of the Cylons was&#8230; given his previous
experience in the last war. It is very cool to think about how
they&#8217;ve already fought them before and what it was like the last
time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As if the last episode/season finale did not end with enough bad
stuff going on, this one opens with almost every bad thing
imaginable all happening at the same time. Some of the bad things
seem a bit too contrived&#8230; like Starbuck losing the raider. But
overall it created a lot of tension that the rest of the season
can resolve.</p>

<p>I like the further development of the backstory for some of the
characters.</p>

<p>I was really struck by how the marine wanted to pray and he
called the president the Gods&#8217; prophet.</p>

<p>I was very annoyed that Lee didn&#8217;t immediately go investigate the
fallen Cylon ship, although maybe the next episode will open with
him doing exactly that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a super epic episode. Boomer and Starbuck were
incredibly brave to do their parts in the beginning. The
realizations on Caprica were fascinating too. And it ended with a
totally crazy situation. The main problem was that there was no
real resolution of anything, just more bad things going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a neat episode. I liked the way the expressed such awe
over finding Kobol. It would be like finding Atlantis but much
much more significant. I don&#8217;t really feel like the episode was
&#8220;Part 1&#8221; of anything though, because it wasn&#8217;t sufficiently
cliff-hangery to make me really need to watch the next part
directly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly&#8212;every two days&#8212;and I haven&#8217;t stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game&#8230; i.e. got to the ending sequence&#8230; on
September 30th, but I&#8217;ve been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b">Here&#8217;s a video commentary</a> of the whole
normal game.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant game. It&#8217;s amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren&#8217;t reflected in the replay. If that&#8217;s the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.</p>

<p>Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a &#8220;puzzle&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren&#8217;t logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It&#8217;s very neat and you don&#8217;t need to have it
explained that you are racing, it&#8217;s so obvious when you start.</p>

<p>The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+&#8230; a game I really loved&#8230; on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.</p>

<p>Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you&#8217;d done before.</p>

<p>I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It&#8217;s an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Gran Turismo 5 for Christmas for my dad and I. I&#8217;d never
really been super into a racing game before, although I played a
racing game for the SNES and I got a diddly wheel for the PS1 to
play Ridge Racer with. I remember going over Sean&#8217;s house and
seeing his brother play Gran Turismo 1, but it&#8217;s always been in my
periphery since then. I&#8217;d been hearing a lot about how awesome the
game was and how demanding it was of your skill, so I decided to
make it a new hobby. Due to the flood, it took until some time in
January to start playing regularly. After getting started with the
controller I decided that I needed a racing wheel and a stand for
it. That was a really good idea, because it made the game so much
more awesome.</p>

<p>From January to September, I played the game every day. For the
first two-ish months I would play for about an hour or so, but
after that I would just do one race/event per night. After
September, I&#8217;ve been playing every two-ish days. After getting up
to the Extreme series in Spec A, I switched to closing out all the
Spec B races. In each case, I would not proceed until I got a gold
on every event (although I delayed a pre-Extreme event because it
was very very difficult.) After closing out the Spec B, I went
back and finished the other Extreme events. My statistics right
now are:</p>

<p>A-Spec Level: 28
B-Spec Level: 40
Game Progress: 95 %
Current Credits: 13,585,072
Total Wins: 303
No. of Cars Owned: 135
Trophies Earned: 50 %
Total Distance Driven: 42,292.1 Miles
Licenses: S (Gold: 25; Silver: 8; Bronze: 27)</p>

<p>Right now, I only have one Spec A event in Extreme left&#8230; the
Formula GT races (which are incredibly difficult) and all the Spec
A Endurance races. Plus I&#8217;d like to go back and get gold in every
License test and I haven&#8217;t done many Special Events.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m at the point where every task left in the game
(i.e. the 5% of the game that remains) is excruciatingly difficult
and often very time consuming. For example, each Formula GT race
takes about 30 minutes and you need to do six of them to win the
event. You can save the game in between races, but you can&#8217;t
tackle the courses piecemeal. The Endurance races were incredibly
tedious even on Spec B (which is AI controlled)&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine
how horrible they would be in Spec A.</p>

<p>Given how much time I&#8217;ve played the game&#8230; obviously it is
amazing. I wish there were more of the average difficulty races,
because I&#8217;m now at the depressing stage of playing the game more
and more. Basically, I wish I could play the game for ever and
keep making incremental progress, whereas right now I feel like I
need to jump a really big wall.</p>

<p>Overall, my favourite thing about the game was the nice difficulty
curve that made you always feel like you were improving and the
general skill that I feel like I&#8217;ve acquired because of it. It&#8217;s
almost like a shmup in a sense, because you have to gain personal
skill to do well. There were some awesome moments at the beginning
of the game when I was shaving milliseconds of trial times to get
a gold trophy. It was very satisfying to do. Sometimes though it
feels like you just need to get a better car to even have a chance
at certain races and it is hard to tell when that is. I think the
UI could be improved to give you some indication that your car is
very weak relative to the competition. Eventually I started using
a guide to recommend which cars to get&#8230; because there are so
many it is hard to decide what to buy at any one time.</p>

<p>The graphics and sound are amazing, as expected. The
side-of-the-road textures are really bad when you are going slow
(because you are terrible) but at the right speed they are
great. I had a little bit of screen tearing, but I get the feeling
it was something with my TV rather than the game. My favourite
tracks were the forest tracks where you got to see the interplay
of shadows and light. Very beautiful.</p>

<p>When I was doing Spec B at the end, I found the RPG side of the
game&#8230; getting credits and cars and upgrades to be strangely
satisfying. I can&#8217;t reiterate enough how absurd the Endurance
races are. There are 9, 12, 24 hour, etc races. It is
ridiculous. I would leave the game on over night or all day to
just finish them once I knew I had a strong enough driver, car,
and pit-strategy to just win with no effort. I wish there were a
&#8220;Simulate until the end of the race&#8221; button. The worst was
grinding the XP to get to the final race. I was a little annoyed
that nothing happened when I beat every single Spec B race.</p>

<p>I will continue playing the game. The main question is whether I
keep pushing at the remaining 5% or if I select the part of the
game that I like and keep doing it over and over. Probably a
balance of the two. However, I don&#8217;t think it would be possible
for me to actually play the whole game from the start again. Maybe
if they had some way of locking you out of certain driving assists
to have a different &#8220;difficulty&#8221; level, I would consider it. But
Gran Turismo 6&#8230;. probably :)</p>
