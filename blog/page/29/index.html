  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.</p>

<p>I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.</p>

<p>In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.</p>

<p>The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.</p>

<p>The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don&#8217;t feel
like it was a cop-out.</p>

<p>The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.</p>

<p>Great game!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.</p>

<p>It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn&#8217;t interested in doing more.</p>

<p>I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don&#8217;t really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I&#8217;ve thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.</p>

<p>Another bad shmup for all the typical reasons. It is absurdly cute
though. I may want to try to play it again just from its
cuteness. Probably not though&#8230; not enough time to play games
that aren&#8217;t amazing.</p>

<p>This is a hori-shmup. I played it for about 30 minutes, but really
didn&#8217;t like it. It had a lot of problems I find in other non-CAVE,
non-Treasure games: slippery controls, invisible bullets, and
weird hitboxes. I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus, which I thought was
a Director&#8217;s Cut-style version of MGS:PO, but is actually a
totally different game mode; so I pretty quickly put it down and
got MGS:PO instead. I&#8217;m still playing that now and like it so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. It isn&#8217;t a
game, but it is on the PSP. It&#8217;s a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn&#8217;t give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.</p>

<p>I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis&#8217; abilities to
the form, because you can&#8217;t really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in watching the second graphic novel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After loving Metal Gear Acid so much, I played Metal Gear
Acid 2.</p>

<p>The opening movie of this was amazing.</p>

<p>The gameplay makes the last game feel like the first Dragon Quest:
there are so many ways the new interface is cleaner, easier, more
fluid, etc. I really like the improvements. The new gameplay
mechanics (like linkages and cover fire) where interesting, but
didn&#8217;t really make it different. But I&#8217;m fine with that, because I
just wanted more game. (The blinding mechanic was definitely new,
but very annoying.)</p>

<p>The game gives you cards in a different order from the last game
and I generally felt the weapon power-level was higher initially,
although the support cards had the same path.</p>

<p>I really liked the cell-shaded style of the 3D graphics.</p>

<p>The game does an absurd jiggling animation with the female
characters. It is ridiculous.</p>

<p>This game seems even more combat focused than the last
game. Whereas in the last game, there were many traversal levels
where combat was the best approach, in this game there are many
straight-out combat missions. This game also feels like it has a
lot less time in between boss encounters. I also noticed that
there weren&#8217;t really any &#8220;puzzle&#8221; levels, like before.</p>

<p>One thing that was close to a puzzle was the train level. It was
really cool to coax enemies into the path of the train and get
them squashed. Woo!</p>

<p>I did a little bit of grinding to get good cards, but I also made
some really stupid decks to get through some levels with a
challenge; both were fun.</p>

<p>The ending was very neat in its cinematic-ness, but the game in
general (and the bosses in particular) was a lot easier.</p>

<p>This game probably has more replay value because of the special
missions, but I didn&#8217;t do any.</p>

<p>Here are my final stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play Time: 14:24:20
Cost: 4395
Found: 45
Kills: 73
Total Damage: 15035
Clear Count: 1
Cards Collected: 41 (I don&#8217;t know what this means&#8230; maybe in the stages?)</p>

<p>I hope there will be an Acid 3.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.</p>

<p>This game is utterly insane in concept. It is a turn-based
tactical game based on the Metal Gear world, with collectible card
game elements. You need to read the Wikipedia page&#8217;s (linked
above) gameplay discussion to possibly understand how it
works. After playing it through, it is brilliant. I can&#8217;t believe
how great it is.</p>

<p>I love the gameplay. It is so deep. The final battle is
particularly epic.</p>

<p>The art is beautiful. There is some great 2D art, in addition to
the cool 3D in the game, but the 2D is definitely a lot better.</p>

<p>The story and characters are great and really &#8220;fit&#8221; in the Metal
Gear universe, even though it is a gaiden.</p>

<p>One of my favourite things in retrospect was the opening movie
that was an &#8220;action&#8221; video, but using the card-mechanics of the
whole game, so it felt really awkward and off-kilter, but in an
endearing way.</p>

<p>I found that the stealth-gameplay was pretty weak and it was
really optimized for combat, but I think that&#8217;s appropriate for
the gameplay since that&#8217;s where it really shines.</p>

<p>I think it would have a lot of replay value, although I never
played any level again, although I definitely died a lot and had
to make many attempts on some levels. In all, the game took me
19:55:01 on Normal difficulty.</p>
