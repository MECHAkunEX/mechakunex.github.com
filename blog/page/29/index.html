  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Persona 3 again. This time I played a female character
named Buffy Summers. That was the best part. I maxed all the
social links with a walkthrough and got all the remaining Personas
(there were five more I needed.) I just played 30 minutes a day
and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies
except bosses, because my MC was soooo powerful. Overall, it
wasn&#8217;t as good as the first time. I can&#8217;t tell if it is because
I&#8217;d done it before, or because being a girl wasn&#8217;t as exciting. I
can&#8217;t really get excited about wooing boys. :) There are
definitely some good jokes if you know what happens to the guy.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence over three days
from the 28th to the 30th. My stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play time: 19:14:20
Save: 12 times
Continue: 18 times
Alert Phase: 51 times
Humans Killed: 97 people
Seriously Injured: 129 times
Total Damage: 29 life bars.
Life Medicine Used: 0 times.
Plants &amp; Animals Captured: 11 kinds
Meals Eaten: 28 meals
Special Item: Not used
Title: Iguana</p>

<p>I have a lot of good things to say about this game, but I have a
few bad things and comments on the above stats.</p>

<p>First, I didn&#8217;t use any life medicine, because I never realized
what it did. I guess it was like a traditional ration from the
earlier games. I&#8217;m not sure how I missed the instructions that
they did that, but I totally ignored them the whole game. It
probably would&#8217;ve made a few things easier if I hadn&#8217;t. D&#8217;oh!</p>

<p>Next, I played on Normal, because there was no &#8220;Game Over if
Spotted&#8221; on any mode except European Extreme, which I don&#8217;t have
the fortitude for. This made me really mad, because I find the
game mechanically weak unless you have to sneak, but implementing
that mode yourself with saves, reloads, etc is waaay to tedious to
actually do. As such, I think my enjoyment of the game suffered a
lot. I don&#8217;t think I can think of any areas of the game that I got
through without alerting the guards. That means that I tried to
sneak, failed, and just ran past them frantically until I got to
the next cut-scene (which stopped the alert) or found somewhere to
hide, but then I&#8217;d just do it again. Thus, the game was basically
totally broken for me. The only mechanics I really did were the
combat mechanics during boss fights, which I&#8217;ve mentioned many
times before, I really don&#8217;t like. The biggest problem though is
that by not having to do areas many times until I got them right,
I really only saw most areas for a few minutes (and in a rush at
that.) Therefore, the scenery of the game didn&#8217;t have time to sink
in and create a lasting memory for me. I think that&#8217;s really
annoying. I almost want to play it again on EE, but then my sanity
checks and I have no desire to go through the horrible combat. I
wish Kojima Productions would realize that the sneaking and the
combat difficulty can be separated. Bummer.</p>

<p>Finally, the game very inelegantly gave me the RPG-7 after a
cut-scene where Snake used it, even though I had never found it up
to that point in the game. Snake just talks about having it, then
uses it, and then I have access to it. Generally these games are
good at forcing you to get things like that, I&#8217;m surprised they
missed this one.</p>

<p>On to the praise&#8230; Most of my praise for the game focuses on
its unique story and setting.</p>

<p>A few gameplay things&#8230; Since the setting is low-tech, I really
enjoy the need to heal yourself, eat food, etc. It makes
everything feel so much more real and impacting. It&#8217;s hard to
express just how that is. This game is a lot more linear than the
previous two MGS games, although very similar in linearity to the
Game Boy Color game I really liked. Basically, there are one-way
doors that lock you from going back in the world. This makes
things constantly feel fresh and new. It works really well in the
story as well, because you are not exploring one area like the
previous games, but you are pushing forward through a jungle to a
base and then to the escape. In a similar way, some of the
fundamental formulas of Metal Gear are really broken off in this
game. The biggest, I think, is that the game does not feel
&#8220;puzzley&#8221;, but rather the challenges come about very
organically. For example, there&#8217;s always been a token mine-field
that you must pass through that you are notified about, but in
this game mines appear very organically where they sensibly
should, and no one warns you about it. Another example is the lack
of remote controlled missile puzzles, etc. A lot of the same
elements are in this game, but they feel much more real and less
abstract, which is great. Overall, I&#8217;d say that I would prefer
more Metal Gear games like this, in particular, with the low-tech,
organic worlds.</p>

<p>On a technical level, there are some great aspects. First, the
music and ambient sound is out of the park amazing. The jungle
sounds like a jungle. Second, the areas are huge and impressive,
not the tiny corridors and rooms from previous games. The models
are nice and the art direction controls the exposure of their
flaws. Third, the first-person view jokes are great.</p>

<p>The best part of the game though, as I said before, is the setting
and story.</p>

<p>I love the opening James-Bond-style movie.</p>

<p>There are many times when characters will quote people from
earlier games that fill the same role as them. For example, Naked
Snake quotes Big Boss (himself) from MG2:SS and Solid Snake from
MGS1 (although I guess in the second case that would imply that
Big Boss had a big influence on Solid and gave him that idea.)</p>

<p>The whole development of Revolver Ocelot is amazing. The subtle
reveals when he is first introduced that he is one and the same;
the relationship between him and Naked; the &#8220;origin&#8221; story they
setup; and the best part&#8212;the post-credits reveal that harkens
back to MGS1 and lays a huge foundational mystery for the whole
series. If there weren&#8217;t so many other amazing characters, Ocelot
would&#8217;ve been the star.</p>

<p>In general, all the characters have really great moments that
reveal who their characters are. The characters serve really well
to reinforce the setting&#8217;s believably and put you in the time
period. I especially like the constant chatter about old movies on
the radio.</p>

<p>But in the end, the game totally sold me on the amazing heroism of
Naked Snake and The Boss. They are so honorable and amazing,
self-sacrificing heroes. I know it sounds cheesy, but it makes me
so proud of people and touches my heart that such pure virtues are
conceivable. When Big Boss was honoring The Boss at the end, it
gave me chills and brought some tears to my eyes. I&#8217;m especially a
sucker for tragedy and it hit the spot there too. Another part I
loved the heroism of was when EVA and Snake are about to go off
towards the end of the game and the Metal Gear theme slowly starts
to play&#8230; amazing.</p>

<p>I found the philosophy of the game great too. Especially The
Boss&#8217;s speech about how enemies don&#8217;t really exist, because we&#8217;re
all human beings and can connect on that level.</p>

<p>This has hands down the best &#8220;ending sequence&#8221; of any Metal
Gear. Not just the scenes after you can play, but the whole final
sequence of getting to the end&#8212;basically from planting the bombs
to the end. It is so epic and awesome.</p>

<p>What a game. I will play it again some day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.</p>

<p>I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.</p>

<p>I was playing as Xiphias and I&#8217;d never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC&#8217;d his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.</p>

<p>I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don&#8217;t anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.</p>

<p>This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.</p>

<p>The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It&#8217;s a blast to play. I&#8217;d like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)</p>

<p>I have three problems with the game.</p>

<p>First, the controllers aren&#8217;t precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that&#8217;s required.</p>

<p>Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.</p>

<p>Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.</p>

<p>But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished playing through Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance early
this morning/late last night. I played for about 11 days, from the
17th to the 28th.</p>

<p>First, some stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Hard
Game Over if Spotted: On
Play Time: 17:56:01
Save: 14 times
Continue: 186 times
Alert Mode: 8 times
Persons: 174 killed
Rations: 83 used
Code Name: Mammoth</p>

<p>I remember playing this game when it came out. I don&#8217;t remember
beating it. Up until I fought with Fatman, I was constantly having
deja vu about the things that were going on, but I couldn&#8217;t tell
you anything that was going to happen. That totally stopped after
the Fatman fight. I guess I stopped playing at that point back in
the day?</p>

<p>I played on Hard just so that I could get the &#8220;Game Over if
Spotted&#8221; option. I wish I could turn that on at the other
difficulty levels. As I&#8217;ve said before, I really dislike the
combat in Metal Gear and when you play on Hard, the bosses are
significantly stronger and it is very tedious and boring, in my
opinion. But, I think the Game Over if Spotted is amazing, because
it forces you to figure out how to get by undetected. I love
that. Given that though, I don&#8217;t know how it was possible that I
ever got any Alert Modes. Perhaps because I killed a guard,
another saw the body, they called reinforcements, and that counts
as Alert Mode.</p>

<p>Obviously I continued A LOT to be able to get through
undetected. I don&#8217;t really care, because it doesn&#8217;t make it any
easier, because you still have to go room-by-room undetected.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really remember anything about the story of this game, so
it was nice to be learn it. It connects really well with what I
remember from MGS4. I&#8217;m excited to continue the saga.</p>

<p>One of my favourite aspects of the game was the way it continually
called back to earlier games; sometimes in a self-acknowledging
way. There were many many scenes, angles, etc that were pulled
right from earlier games. I especially like how at the end of the
game, they integrate that into the story. I really like the way
the game is about video games and people who play them, in a
sense.</p>

<p>One of my favourite moments was when Snake tells Raiden he can get
more ammo from him, Raiden asks him how he has so much ammo, Snake
points at his bandanna and says &#8220;Infinite Ammo&#8221;. Of course, in
MGS1 if you save Meryl, the next time you play you get a bandanna
that gives you infinite ammo. =)</p>

<p>Another great moment for me was when Snake and Otacon depart at an
elevator and the theme song slowly swells. Very touching.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t mind Raiden at all. Of course, the cat has long been out
of the bag that the game isn&#8217;t about him. I don&#8217;t remember
thinking it was weird at all when I was younger either. I do
really like how they initially call him Snake&#8212;of course,
because, it&#8217;s just a code name, but change it. I also like how at
the end of the game, when Snake finally appears in his sneaking
suit, he says, &#8220;Have you been waiting long?&#8221; or something to
Raiden, and, of course, to the player.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the game were great. I especially like that
guards can follow footprints better now.</p>

<p>There were a few things about the gameplay that bugged me.</p>

<p>First, Raiden doesn&#8217;t start with the means to tranquilize people,
so I felt compelled to kill pretty early, whereas I got through
Snake&#8217;s part without killing anyone. I was planning on doing that,
but it quickly failed. Later in the game, there are many many
places that are very combat focused (the tag team with Snake, for
example) and that&#8217;s not what the game is about for me, so it
bugged me.</p>

<p>Second, the end of the bomb disposal segment was annoying because
I got to the area of the final bomb with almost 200 seconds to
spare, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get close enough to the
bomb. (You had to crawl on a rail in the water, on Hard.) And so I
had to run all the way back two or three times, even though I got
there perfectly. Relatedly annoying was the distance you needed to
be before you jumped into water&#8212;to far. I did it accidentally a
lot.</p>

<p>Third, the swimming controls are awful. Ugh.</p>

<p>Fourth, escort missions suck. Ugh.</p>

<p>At the very end of the game, there is a huge spike in combat
difficulty, especially with the last two bosses. I probably tried
30 times on each. I almost gave up and just watched the ending of
YouTube, but decided to man up and do it. It worked out well too,
because in the end I beat the final boss without using any
rations. I had enough practice with his attacks. =)</p>

<p>Great game!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Late last year I got エスプガルーダII from someone on the SHMUPS
forum. I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until January, when I
stopped playing Mushi every day. My scores as of now are:
- ESPGaluda II - 360 Novice - Asagi: All-Clear. 217,480,251 points. #669 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Black Label Novice - Seseri: All-Clear. 229,344,460 points. #938 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Arrange - Tateha: Stage 2. 2,888,170 points. #1320 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - Omake! - Asagi: All-Clear. 496,851,202 points. #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Asagi: Stage 2. 1,615,157 points. #1675 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Ageha: Stage 3. 12,034,604 points. #771 #hiscore</p>

<p>I was able to easily 1CC the easy modes, but I&#8217;ve been working on
the normal modes for some time.</p>

<p>The art in the game is very pretty, but not as fantastical as
Mushi. Most of the enemies are human (they leave blood stains on
the ground, eww) or normal military-looking things, which I find
kind of boring. Nevertheless, the art, given the style, is
great.</p>

<p>The music on the first level is AMAZING, but the music for the
rest of the game is just so-so.</p>

<p>The scoring system is interesting. Basically, you get gems and
gold. Killing enemies drops gems. You can use gems to slow down
time. When you destroy an enemy and time is slowed, then all their
bullets become gold. (If you try to slow down time, but don&#8217;t have
gems, time speeds up. If you kill enemies in this mode, they drop
gold. Also, you are always getting points just for being in this
mode.) Now, time is slower for the bullets, but not the
characters, so by slowing down time you build up many bullets on
the screen and you can cash them all in for gold if you picked a
good time (where good time means you can kill the enemy.) This is
a really neat risk/reward system because you can spend gems to
make it easier to dodge or to get high scores; and, getting high
scores means there needs to be many bullets, and you need to
accurately gauge if you can kill the enemy with the number of gems
you have, otherwise all those bullets will need to be dodged.</p>

<p>While it is very interesting, I don&#8217;t find the game as enjoyable
as Mushi. It doesn&#8217;t have the same pace or something. I&#8217;ve played
it every day for about six months and I think I will play it much
less frequently, and spend more time with Mushi.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve also been playing Decimation X3.</p>

<p>This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of
control insane. I love it.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it
regularly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel over the past three
days. This is a Game Boy Color game. At first, I assumed it would
basically be just like the first two Metal Gear games for the
MSX. It is, but it has clearly greatly evolved. This is the
perfect 2D Metal Gear. It makes me think (like I think for so many
series) how much better the series would be if it stuck in 2D but
got bigger, better, and more beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how many of the mechanics from MGS they were able to
integrate into the game. For example, looking around walls is done
brilliantly. Tapping on walls works great. All the weapons
return. It&#8217;s really a spectacular game. In some ways I&#8217;d say it is
better than MGS because many mechanics actually appear multiple
times. For example, there&#8217;s really only one time you need to use
the Nikita Missiles in MGS (when you destroy the only electrical
panel in the game), but there are many instances in this
game. Same thing with the C4; there&#8217;s one occurrences in MGS, but
many in this. I like the richness of that.</p>

<p>This game is technically linear and broken into stages, but in
many ways that is totally fine and a little inaccurate. It&#8217;s a bit
inaccurate because there are many stages where you revisit areas
from previous stages (but that&#8217;s a severe minority.) It&#8217;s totally
fine because if you really break it down, MGS was linear too:
there is very sparse back-tracking. For example, once you go to
Otacon&#8217;s lab, there&#8217;s no reason to ever go back, even though you
could. This game just turns that admission into something enforced
by the game. Still though, each stage is really large and they
individually contain a lot of back-tracking. But really,
back-tracking (the need to go to old areas) and open world (the
technical ability to revisit old areas) are not valuable in and of
themselves. What is valuable is when the world feels &#8220;real&#8221; and
not artificial like a traditional stage-based game. This game
really makes the world feel real because of the way that things
connect and the size of the areas generally. In fact, I really see
a lot of this game in MGS4, which has a similar open-world
stage-based setup, where many areas have internal sections that
don&#8217;t allow back-tracking.</p>

<p>I really want to think about this game as the basis for another 2D
Metal Gear-style game.</p>

<p>Here are the stats that I got:</p>

<p>Play Time: 02:56:07
Being Found: 001 times
Enemies: 000 killed
Rations: 008 used
Code Name: Spider</p>

<p>I was able to get such scores by using save states and always
restarting a room if I got caught. I don&#8217;t feel this is cheating
because I still had to overcome the obstacle myself. It&#8217;s really
an efficient way to do the traditional MGS Extreme mode where you
get a Game Over when you get caught. If I made an MGS-style game,
it would have this be an option and have it really stream-lined
(maybe Super Meat Boy streamlined.)</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>
