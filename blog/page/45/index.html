  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through A Boy and His Blob for the Wii. I&#8217;d been
watching this game since it was announced because it was 2D,
looked beautiful, and looked really cute too.</p>

<p>When I first started playing, I was very thorough: getting
every treasure and going through every challenge level, but
eventually (as you read below) the challenge levels became
incredibly painful and I started to hate the game because of
them. After that I just raced through the game and didn&#8217;t even get
many chests in the final world.</p>

<h1>Things I loved</h1>

<p>The 2D graphics are really pretty. I like the brightness and
the fluidity of them in particular. I like that the levels reflect
what the world map implies about them and sometimes you can see
the later landmarks on the map from inside them.  For example,
seeing the tower from the middle of the final world was epic.</p>

<p>The whole style is incredibly cute and heartwarming. The boy is
the best five year old I&#8217;ve ever seen in a game and I love the hug
animation. Even the enemies are kind of pudgy and cute.</p>

<p>The vast variety of beans is very entertaining. Only a few of
them overlap in functionality, so the puzzles are not necessarily
&#8220;non-linear&#8221;, but the variety of different kinds of puzzles keeps
it fresh. I would&#8217;ve liked a mode where I could play a level with
a custom selection of beans (perhaps after I beat it or got all
the chests.)</p>

<p>The puzzles are clever enough. There are a few places where you
can really break things with creativity, but that is fun. For
example, you can get birds to hit mine blobs and just walk out of
some otherwise difficult things; the Zorb bean can survive any
fall and is invulnerable, so you can just jump in it and then jump
off a cliff rather than blob-achute down. I think the final areas
(in the castles) had the best puzzles in terms of difficulty and
interestingatude.</p>

<p>I was very surprised when I got to the first boss battle. I
thought the worked really well as multi-part puzzles. Although,
I&#8217;ll complain about them more later&#8230; that they exist is
definitely a plus.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the lack of text and the way the game
communicated to you what you were supposed to do and the
intentions of the blob, etc. This is best illustrated by the lack
of a menu. I love that you turn the game on and are almost
instantly controlling the boy.</p>

<p>MECHA BLOB!</p>

<h1>Things I hated</h1>

<p>Although the puzzles were clever and interesting, there was not
enough mystery because almost every stage has a sign instructing
you which of the four beans is the correct one to use for that
segment. This really kills a lot of the enjoyment, because you&#8217;re
not so much &#8220;solving the puzzle&#8221; as &#8220;executing the solution&#8221;. I
will complain below about the tools you have for &#8220;executing&#8221;, so
this turns out to be a big problem.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the game, the challenge levels don&#8217;t have
checkpoints. This makes playing them really jarring because it
doesn&#8217;t fit with the general feel. Since the challenge levels have
the hardest &#8220;reflex&#8221; challenges (more below), this is particularly
annoying. Some of the challenge levels are just stupid-cheap
too. For example, I quit playing them after one where you had to
drop a Trampobean down a pit and then jump hoping you landed on it
correctly. You then had to do this four more times, restarting
from the beginning when you missed. Since the beans bounce and
have physics applied to them, it is frustrating and unsatisfying
to make the jump correctly.</p>

<p>There are a few annoying bugs. Level 4-1 sticks in my mind
because you don&#8217;t have the blob with you, so he doesn&#8217;t eat the
chests. Instead, you drop them into the ground level where the
blob will get them later. I dropped every chest and made it to the
next checkpoint, yet only two chests were there at the
end. Arggh.</p>

<h1>The biggest most &#8220;shoot myself in the face&#8221; problem</h1>

<p>The controls are unimaginably bad. They are sluggish and
inaccurate. It is like trying to push an anvil with a wet
noodle. I&#8217;ve read the developers talk about how this is partly
because the boy is supposed to be a clumsy kid but that seems like
a total cop-out. This just plain sucks. I think the sluggish-ness
would not be as bad if you could use the D-pad to control the boy,
but even on the Classic controller (where most buttons duplicate
what another button does), you cannot. This is especially dumb
because the game is 2D.</p>

<p>In general, this horrible control would be much more passable
if the game did not require reflexes. Yet, there are many reflex
sections that require exact platforming control yet the mechanics
do not give the ability to do it. I don&#8217;t mind restarting levels,
etc (I play shmups after all), but that&#8217;s because the games I play
that require that always make clear that it is /your fault/
when you die and it never feels like the game&#8217;s fault. I can
honestly say that almost all the time, I felt like I was dying
because the controls were so bad. There is nothing more
frustrating than this.</p>

<p>The bad controls are made worse by some of the custom bean
controls. The Zorb, Rocket, and Bouncer are the biggest offenders,
because they are the most mobile beans. The Blobachute is bad
too.</p>

<p>This problem is why the challenge levels were so bad. They were
almost all reflex based and had a higher than normal restart
penalty. The bosses were frustrating for the same reason. The
third boss was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I
wanted to blow my brains out. Ugh.</p>

<h1>The verdict</h1>

<p>This is a good game, but not a classic. I only want to play
classics. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be playing this much more, but if I
have a young friend in the near future I may point them at this or
donate the game to them.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.</p>

<p>I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).</p>

<h1>Things I liked</h1>

<p>I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.</p>

<p>I like the art style.</p>

<p>I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: &#8220;There is a dungeon
outside the town.&#8221;), it&#8217;s natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn&#8217;t often that I could &#8220;phone it in&#8221; and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.</p>

<p>I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you&#8217;re
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can&#8217;t defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)</p>

<p>I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)</p>

<h1>Things I didn&#8217;t like</h1>

<p>The mapping system isn&#8217;t advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something&#8212;like the link between a
portal&#8217;s entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way&#8212;where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn&#8217;t be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.</p>

<p>The character customization didn&#8217;t have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn&#8217;t upgrade everything (there just aren&#8217;t enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.</p>

<p>I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn&#8217;t bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst
enemy and I wasn&#8217;t making enough improvement after a few weeks of
sporadic play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Bayonetta for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>This game is insane. The craziness of the situations Bayonetta
is in is truly ridiculous. One of my favourite parts is when you
are falling out of an airplane&#8217;s cargo bay, so you stop time and
jump up the falling crates. Awesome. The fights are insane. The
climax finishes are equally ridiculous. The attention to detail is
really stellar too. The gameplay is intense. Oh man. This game is
great.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the soundtrack, especially the theme song and
the rendition of &#8220;Fly Me to the Moon&#8221;.</p>

<p>I played through on Normal, then Very Easy, then Easy, then
Hard (finished in under 3 hours), then Non-Stop Infinite Climax
(the hardest difficulty, crazy name huh?) (finished in 3 hours, 4
minutes.) I ended up playing the game for a total of 33 hours, 50
minutes, and 45 seconds. I unlocked everything (except Sai-Fon),
got almost all the achievements, tried out the extra characters,
etc. I didn&#8217;t like playing with the extra characters or the extra
costumes as much because the detail just wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>The main thing I disliked about the game was the
&#8220;mini-games&#8221;. For example, there is a shooting gallery game, a
racing level, and a Space Harrier-like level. These introduce
totally new control schemes and don&#8217;t have the polish of the
overall game. Unlike Treasure, who takes the same mechanics and
control and puts them in a different genre, Platinum Games just
implemented a whole other game and put it inside Bayonetta. I
especially dislike the Space Harrier level.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/09/09/10-video-games-that-should-be-comics/">description of Bayonetta</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t played it, Bayonetta is the story of<br/>a bespectacled witch who straps guns to her feet so that she can<br/>kick people in the face while she&#8217;s shooting them in the face at<br/>the same time, and the better she fights, the more naked she<br/>gets. Oh, and also, she kills angels with a zeal that makes her a<br/>pretty close equivalent to a sexy female version of Ronnie James<br/>Dio. In other words, she&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d get if you went back<br/>in time and told fourteen year-old me to imagine best thing<br/>ever.</p></blockquote>


<p>Finally, a little comment on the M rating. I generally don&#8217;t
play M rated games because I don&#8217;t want to see extreme violence,
hear nasty language, or see pornography. The violence in Bayonetta
doesn&#8217;t bother me because the enemies are so inhuman (and the
humans, including Bayonetta herself, bleed e.g. rose petals); for
the large grotesque monsters the blood and gore doesn&#8217;t even feel
like gore. It looks like they&#8217;re spewing lava or something. I
thought the language in Bayonetta was bad, especially one
particular character (the Italian stooge.) I was initially
impressed that Bayonetta herself never used bad language, but she
once says the F word. It sounds really out of character because
she&#8217;s normally so sophisticated. I didn&#8217;t like that and it&#8217;s one
reason I never watched cut-scenes after the first
play-through. Finally, the pornography side. In my opinion,
Bayonetta is actually quite tame compared to many modern
games. Bayonetta replaces titillating graphic nudity with a
general sexual tone and flashes of partial nudity. This playful
PG-13-ness makes me grin and laugh at the craziness, rather than
be offended. I&#8217;m sure others would disagree, but that&#8217;s how I
feel. It definitely doesn&#8217;t pass the &#8220;Would I want my 13 year old
son to play it?&#8221; test, but I wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed if my college age
child did.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was really impressed by this game. I recommend
it. Play with the volume low in the cutscenes or just skip (the
story is only good for its insanity) if your ears are like
mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.</p>

<p>We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn&#8217;t stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we&#8217;ve completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.</p>

<p>The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I&#8217;m a major
opponent of innovation for innovation&#8217;s sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.</p>

<p>This game is FUN. I can&#8217;t wait to play with the <em>REDACTED</em> and his
sister (We haven&#8217;t decided on her pseudonym yet.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.</p>

<p>/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.</p>

<p>The best reviews of this game are&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>&#8220;YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&#8221;</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure&#8217;s latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>


<p>And&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>


<p>The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.</p>

<p>The only problem with the game, for me, is that I&#8217;m a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can &#8220;Save &amp; Quit&#8221; without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won&#8217;t score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.</p>

<p>my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I&#8217;d like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I&#8217;ve seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don&#8217;t need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I&#8217;ve played with enjoy it and wouldn&#8217;t like it if they had to do
more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I&#8217;d comment on it more than my original post.</p>

<p>I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it&#8217;s a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to express what I like about it. There&#8217;s so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I&#8217;ve been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I&#8217;ll get better though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn&#8217;t mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an &#8220;arranged&#8221; soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version. This seems to me &#8220;edited&#8221; or
&#8220;variant&#8221;, although in most cases the &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don&#8217;t really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.</p>

<p>However, I definitely don&#8217;t like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles&#8217; music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.</p>

<p>As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I&#8217;ve gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I&#8217;m starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post about Ikaruga, I&#8217;ve continued my daily
training. I&#8217;ve made a few new accomplishments:
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.</em> I&#8217;ve been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here&#8217;s a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I&#8217;ve had a 12 chain
stretch and I&#8217;m on a 14 chain stretch. If I&#8217;m imbalanced because
I didn&#8217;t have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I&#8217;ve been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I&#8217;ll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it&#8217;s time for the boss and I&#8217;ve got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it&#8217;s that important, but I&#8217;d like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.</em> This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn&#8217;t say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I&#8217;m a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn&#8217;t get hit once (which is good
because I didn&#8217;t have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I still love this game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five &#8220;acts&#8221; of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.</p>

<p>I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.</p>

<p>Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don&#8217;t invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you&#8217;ll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.</p>

<p>The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you&#8217;d want
to buy, so it just accumulates.</p>

<p>The story is interesting but there isn&#8217;t anything too special
about it.</p>

<p>The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn&#8217;t I quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I&#8217;ve decided to stop
playing because I&#8217;ve been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great: it&#8217;s a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
&#8220;catch-them-all&#8221; with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can &#8220;crack&#8221;.</p>

<p>The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn&#8217;t
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn&#8217;t realize that you could
change a character&#8217;s skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn&#8217;t the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.</p>

<p>However, there are a few key points where if you&#8217;ve done every
single battle before them and you&#8217;ve cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won&#8217;t be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.</p>
