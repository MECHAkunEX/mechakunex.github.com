  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options&#8212;choosing different characters&#8212;is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe this wasn&#8217;t originally a Mario game and wasn&#8217;t
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.</p>

<p>I also use Peach by the way, she&#8217;s the best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I&#8217;ve played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can&#8217;t deal
with it.</p>

<p>The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played some of Iron Tank the other day.</p>

<p>This was a super retro-goggle game. I didn&#8217;t like it at all, but I
remember playing the first level sooo many times as a kid.</p>

<p>I found the controls to be really sloppy and the game to be too
slow. This is definitely a common complaint I have, but I want
games that are very exciting and fast. I don&#8217;t have the patience
for ones that are too mind-numbing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to play through Final Fantasy 13 again in preparation
for Final Fantasy 13-2&#8217;s release.</p>

<p>I started on 2011/11/26 and finished on 2012/01/09 and played it
basically every day. I intended to just critical path the story
and not do any side quests or grinding of any kind. I kept that up
until the final boss area. It took 23 hours (23:15) to get to Gran
Pulse, about 12 hours (34:40) to get through Pulse and then 3
hours (38:45) to get to the final area. At that point I decided
that I would get all the achievements, so I grinded for 30 hours
(64:30), then did side quests for about 9 hours (73:45), then
grinded a bit more (77:57), then beat the game (79:56), and then
finished the remaining side quests and trophies (88:54). It was
interesting that this was the same amount of time as the last time
I played through and didn&#8217;t get everything.</p>

<p>Playing through the second time really solidified for me how
awesome this game is. It does an amazing job at making the combat
section action-packed and skill based. I remember being totally
destroyed by a few bosses the first time through the game; and
this time even though I was less powerful after I was beat once, I
could re-orient my strategy based on a better understanding of the
mechanics and conquer it.</p>

<p>I still think there are some improvements that could be made. I
noticed that the voice acting throughout Pulse is much worse than
the rest of the voice acting. I was bugged by how important
position was in combat, even though you can&#8217;t really influence
it. I was also re-convinced that the game is way too stingy on
money and experience.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, it was amazing and it definitely enters the FF
canon for me. I look forward to the next one with great
anticipation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played a bunch of Double Dragon the other day.</p>

<p>This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,
playing through a bunch of it recently really made it seem pretty
lame. I pretty much steam-rolled the game up through the end of
Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I played Clash at Demonhead for about an hour last night.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting action platforming game. In my mind,
that genre is defined by Mega Man and Metroid if the combat is
projectile based. The thing that is particularly interesting about
it is that it uses a Metroidvania like structure where you have a
large world that you can repeatedly explore and go through. Unlike
Metroid where the gameplay is &#8220;uniform&#8221;, Clash has different modes
where you choose paths on the world map and then do a platform
level. Almost like Mega Man where you choose bosses that are
otherwise disconnected.</p>

<p>As I said, I played for about an hour and in that time, I didn&#8217;t
really catch the vision of the open world. Instead it just felt
really confusing and mish-mashed together. It makes me wonder if I
would feel Metroid was the same way if I played it totally
fresh.</p>

<p>Additionally, the action is good but not as good as Metroid or
Mega Man. So I&#8217;ve decided to put it down for a while and maybe I
will play it again so I can give it a better chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode. It was mainly about Lee and his
psyche. I&#8217;m not sure I really understand what he was supposed to
be feeling; perhaps that his life isn&#8217;t really fulfilling because
he doesn&#8217;t have anyone to share it with. I thought the market
stuff was interesting, although I disagree with their
presentation of it as a necessary evil, because trade is mutually
beneficial. The main problem is that by the government making it
illegal, they let criminals thrive because there is no court
system to enforce their contracts. It&#8217;s the same thing with drugs
in the USA. Unfortunate.</p>
