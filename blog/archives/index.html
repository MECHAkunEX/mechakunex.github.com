<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a fun, fast-paced action movie. I liked how the world of
the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They&#8217;ve laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, &#8220;Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?&#8221; He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn&#8217;t move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different

<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie was suggested by Netflix and I wasn&#8217;t sure I would like
it. As we watched it, it was pretty cute and touching. It was very
reminiscent of how my wife and I were when we first met&#8230; fell in
love over the course of 10 days and then didn&#8217;t see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years
and years past&#8230; it was a very depressing and unhappy ending.</p>

<time datetime="2012-08-01T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>01</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren&#8217;t totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren&#8217;t really
super heroes&#8230; more &#8220;super spys&#8221; and that didn&#8217;t seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character&#8230; the actor played him too &#8220;cool&#8221; and above-it-all.</p>

<p>There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, there&#8217;s only one God, and I don&#8217;t
think He dresses like that.&#8221; Not only was it delivered really well,
but it&#8217;s such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I&#8217;m surprised
that in this episode they didn&#8217;t show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rally girl&#8221; thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn&#8217;t playing.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>My wife has been wanting to watch this show for a while, based on
the recommendation of her good friend. I can&#8217;t think of that many
things that I care less about than football, so I&#8217;ve been
dragging my feet about watching it.</p>

<p>I found the first episode to be interesting. It is very
predictable in the plot development. The characters mostly play
to type, but they have a very real quality to them&#8230; like they
could be real people out there in a world that I know nothing
about (Texas, and Football.)</p>

<p>I really like the movie Varsity Blues and this is very
reminiscent of it. The small-town quaintness is cute and it is
interesting to learn about something I know nothing about.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed that no character in the show expressed
the idea that Jason&#8217;s sacrifice was not worth it and that one
game or football itself is not worth ruining your life
over. Hopefully that will come up later.</p>

<p>I very much like the amount of faith in the show.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d never read Jane Eyre before, but didn&#8217;t have very big
expectations for this movie. It was very well done and pretty
fascinating. I found the story to go very slowly and have a really
unpredictable structure. I expected to learn more about the
boarding school, but did not. I expected to learn more about her
job after meeting the Rivers, but did not. It seemed like it was
going to be a horror story before the old wife is revealed. After
getting through my expectations, it was very enjoyable.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I&#8217;ve
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game&#8230; they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she&#8217;d be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said &#8220;until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die&#8221; instead of
&#8220;until death do you part&#8221;&#8230; thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.</p>

enjoy the story in this Dragon Quest. It does a really good job of

<div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason I had lower expectations for this movie than recent
super hero movies I&#8217;ve seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning&#8230; like when he jumped on the grenade&#8230; and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn&#8217;t really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I&#8217;m excited to see The Avengers!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend&#8217;s commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too&#8230; like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning&#8230; it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple

<time datetime="2012-07-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they&#8217;ve been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) &#8220;We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we&#8217;ve
uncovered.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren&#8217;t &#8220;conscientious&#8221; enough and even then
they say &#8220;almost any&#8221; and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don&#8217;t make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the &#8220;companies&#8221; we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a &#8220;Great&#8221;
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a &#8220;humble&#8221; leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>

learning to run in a direction and doesn&#8217;t have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn&#8217;t beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you&#8217;ve conquered.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a fine little romance. The most interesting thing about it
is how this, and other movies (like the Chaplin biopic) rewrite the
history of the Communist/Hollywood controversy of the 50s to play
out the way that modern Hollywood people wish that it would. It
makes me think that maybe some people wouldn&#8217;t realize that
Hollywood didn&#8217;t really &#8220;win&#8221;. There&#8217;s a lot of Hollywood
dopey-eye-ism in the movie, actually. It reminds me a lot of
Hugo.</p>

<p>I think the movie might have been improved by making it more
ambiguous about whether Jim Carrey really lost his memory.</p>

<p>The reviews are interesting. I think Roger Ebert saw what it was
going for and believed in it. The speech at the end was a bit too
dopey for my taste.</p>

that there was a deeper world in the background, but that it was
not too tantalizing (for a movie like this.) I thought the aliens
looked cool and Daniel Craig was super tough. The juxtaposition,
though, was the best part. All-around a good time.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the movie. It&#8217;s very much unlike anything else in
its grand scheme. Maybe a little bit like Stargate. It takes a
little while to get started, but once it does, the pay-off is
great. I think what I like most about it is the way it spins a
world so well.</p>

<p>It makes me very interested in reading the series of books.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.</p>

<p>I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren&#8217;t
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She&#8217;s got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.</p>

<p>I quite like the development of Pete&#8217;s understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.</p>

<p>I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter&#8217;s
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like &#8220;This Means War&#8221;, in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don&#8217;t think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely &#8220;hot&#8221; lady, although she&#8217;s definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her &#8220;sexy&#8221; scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.</p>

<p>&#8211; Review &#8211;</p>

<p>This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It&#8217;s exactly like Demon&#8217;s Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon&#8217;s Souls.</p>

<p>I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could&#8217;ve been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren&#8217;t a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.</p>

<p>The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I&#8217;m undead, there&#8217;s a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don&#8217;t really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls story was very
coherent.</p>

<p>The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it&#8217;s all interconnected. It&#8217;s very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly &#8220;level&#8221;-y.</p>

<p>I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon&#8217;s. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don&#8217;t
think it really evolved that much.</p>

<p>The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn&#8217;t even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last&#8230; maybe I
just found a better farming spot.</p>

<p>The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon&#8217;s, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don&#8217;t really find the
game that difficult&#8230; just a good challenge&#8230; like Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon&#8217;s. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks&#8212;about the same
amount of total days, I think.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the game. But, I won&#8217;t be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I&#8217;d really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.</p>

<p>The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.</p>

<p>The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I&#8217;m glad that the characters realize this
too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny because when she&#8217;s in the field, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.</p>

<p>The real moment of Katniss&#8217; catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.</p>

<p>The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.</p>

<p>I find the term &#8220;Mockingjay&#8221; used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)</p>

<p>I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol&#8230; tense!</p>

pretty good&#8230; still hard because you&#8217;ve got to learn the area,

<div class="entry-content"><p>The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.</p>

<p>I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there&#8217;s no doubt about
that, but I&#8217;m not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/06/27/Book--Catching-Fire--by-Suzanne-Collins--2009--0/">Book: Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins (2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-06-27T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.</p>

<p>The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It&#8217;s as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn&#8217;t possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.</p>

<p>I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>I teared up in the District 11 scene.</p>

<p>Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?</p>

<p>It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.</p>

<p>Haymitch&#8217;s story is great.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;food porn&#8221; in the books never gets old, strangely.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; private session with the Gamemakers :)</p>

<p>The pre-Games interviews were amazing.</p>

<p>The end of Part II is waaaay intense.</p>

<p>I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss&#8217; body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s &#8220;naked&#8221; or talk about
her &#8220;breasts&#8221; and most often she mentions her &#8220;underwear&#8221;,
&#8220;underclothes&#8221;, or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;. It&#8217;s particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we&#8217;re so often given.</p>

<p>The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m disappointed the movie didn&#8217;t use the plot-point about the
&#8220;traitor&#8221; that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It&#8217;s a cool
idea.</p>

<p>I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine the audience really being excited about
it.</p>

<p>Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It&#8217;s very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn&#8217;t as touching.</p>

the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so

<div class="entry-content"><p>I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that if the Capitol is &#8220;surrounded&#8221; by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia&#8230; i.e. very far away&#8230; how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.</p>

<p>Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel&#8217;s Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I&#8217;d
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn&#8217;t kill him&#8230;). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave&#8230; which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain&#8230; and a major mistake to go down there. I think I&#8217;ll
grind for souls and just buy them.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/06/20/Movie--This-Means-War--starring-Reese-Witherspoon--2012--0/">Movie: This Means War, starring Reese Witherspoon (2012)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-06-20T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a totally over the top movie. It&#8217;s silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some funny moments and characters&#8212;like the way the CIA
teams act on the &#8220;case&#8221; and Lauren&#8217;s friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the &#8220;super fast&#8221; type without much impact.</p>

<p>There a few moments of real romance&#8212;when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he&#8217;s watching Titantic and the look on Tuck&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there&#8217;s no meaning
behind their actions.</p>

<p>But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren&#8217;t really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t look at Lauren
enough when they&#8217;re talking&#8230; it&#8217;s very unnatural.)</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she&#8217;s trying too hard to look
sexy&#8230; particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other&#8230; it&#8217;s like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film.</p>

<p>I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they&#8217;re
fighting fear itself, but there&#8217;s no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The movie&#8217;s version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Hank&#8217;s relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men&#8212;meaning in the government or &#8220;public&#8221;
sector&#8212;namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn&#8217;t respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus &#8220;pure love&#8221;. The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there&#8217;s no need for the concept of &#8220;love&#8221;. In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial &#8220;trade&#8221; and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.</p>

<p>It makes me think of Hayek&#8217;s comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I read the speech by Francisco at James&#8217; wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It&#8217;s like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don&#8217;t know that much more than the characters but it&#8217;s so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn&#8217;t occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven&#8217;t got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I&#8217;m just
impervious to thinking they are too long?</p>

<p>Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love&#8217;s interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I&#8217;m kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough &#8220;he said&#8221;/&#8221;she said&#8221; that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as &#8220;usability&#8221; problems with books.</p>

<p>For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I&#8217;m not
totally sure the speakers are correct:</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be &#8230; like this. Growing colder and things stopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hank: &#8220;I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;You did? Funny, I thought that, too.&#8221;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It&#8217;s a fascinating book. I don&#8217;t find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be&#8230; it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to not compare the book&#8217;s story to the story of the
movie. I don&#8217;t know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.</p>

<p>For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It&#8217;s not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.</p>

<p>In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.</p>

<p>I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are &#8220;the
People&#8217;s state of such-and-such&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.</p>

insane, because there are two of them, I can&#8217;t really defend

<div class="entry-content"><p>In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
<em>REDACTED</em>ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early <em>REDACTED</em>ism.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well&#8230; not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a pretty cheesy comic book movie. The story was quite
different than others, with its god-like characters and its vast
universe.</p>

<p>On one hand, I liked that it didn&#8217;t really dwell on the fact that
aliens exist, etc. But on the hand, that was the most interesting
part of the movie, but it was also totally unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The characters all play totally to type and lots of character
development consists of almost a single scene to establish the type
and then the movie moves on. (Most of the scenes with Blake
Lively.)</p>

<p>My other favourite scene was the opening dog fight with the
experimental planes. It was interesting how it foreshadowed the
ending. It was unfortunate that an otherwise heroic moment was
shattered by a cliche character reveal.</p>

<p>And one more&#8230; when Blake saw through the disguise. Brilliant.</p>

<p>But despite a few high moments, it&#8217;s a pretty vapid movie.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours tonight. I explored the rest of
Sen&#8217;s Fortress (or at least, I got to the boss) and then I
unlocked a shortcut to the boss, and then I tried to fight the
boss many many times. I could generally avoid almost every single
attack&#8230; occasionally I would get grabbed, but I could generally
heal myself. The main problem was that I kept getting knocked off
the tower by him. I probably fought him about 20 times. I explored
a number of different weapon options. Probably the best was
putting a Lightning enhancement on my Iaito, but I didn&#8217;t have
enough to keep using it. Eventually I used the Drake Sword
(because Iaito&#8217;s bleed didn&#8217;t effect the Golem.) I won and it felt
real good. I explored the next area a tiny bit. I killed all the
Sentinels and got a level from that. I&#8217;m excited to be making
steady progress.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.</p>

<p>I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She&#8217;s a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That&#8217;s important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said &#8220;Amazing chest ahead&#8221;. It&#8217;s so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.</p>

<p>After failing utterly fighting her <em>and</em> realizing I hadn&#8217;t
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn&#8217;t buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.</p>

<p>I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn&#8217;t
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.</p>

<p>So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I&#8217;d get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.)</p>

<p>After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.</p>

<p>I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.</p>

<p>With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds&#8212;first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit <em>real</em> hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.</p>

<p>So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I&#8217;ll have to
perfect it later.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie and the other ones were
pretty bad. I think their biggest failure was being too fantasy and
with too many monsters, etc. This movie doesn&#8217;t have that problem,
but it is definitely not as good as previous ones.</p>

<p>There are some fun moments of <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow being <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow. A
few absurd fights and chases. It&#8217;s a fairly fun and crazy movie.
The mermaids are totally beautiful and the mermaid who serves as
the love interest has a very sweet and innocent feel to her.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about a lot of the movie, it is pretty absurd
and silly, but I&#8217;m not sure I should really expect anything
different. It&#8217;s a solid B+. I think with a few more exciting fights
and a bit more plot coherence it could have been an A-.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I spent the time
working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I
would get repeatedly pummeled by the huge ghouls and then I kept
falling off and getting swarmed closer to the swamp. It was pretty
rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.</p>

<p>Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls&#8230; about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon&#8217;s Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can&#8217;t get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It&#8217;s kind of frustrating.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn&#8217;t recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn&#8217;t skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.</p>

<p>I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I&#8217;m getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That&#8217;ll be nice to experiment with.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I went on a long flight, so I started a new DS game.</p>

<p>A few years ago I played through the first DS Advance Wars game
and found it really enjoyable, so I decided to go through the next
one.</p>

<p>I played for about 11 hours on the flight! I can&#8217;t believe my
battery lasted that long&#8212;but I did stop because it was about to
die. Then I played for another 2-ish hours while waiting for the
next flight and then on it.</p>

<p>I got about chapter 21, which appears to be about 80 or 90%
through the game. I only did the challenge levels in the very
beginning, but stopped once they outstripped my patience and
focused on the campaign levels.</p>

<p>The game is pretty much exactly the same as the last one. I don&#8217;t
remember having the anti-tank guns or the bikes in the last game,
but I could be wrong. There&#8217;s no &#8220;dual strike&#8221; anymore, which is
good because it was always a pain to look at the top screen too.</p>

<p>The game is very interesting in a way, because there&#8217;s no
progression system. Although you are gradually given new units and
abilities, you don&#8217;t have any input on that process, it&#8217;s all
story based. In essence, each level is about defeating the enemy
with the endownment you&#8217;ve been given. Very similar to my ideas
for rougelike RPGs.</p>

<p>I had a few ridiculous battles. For example, mission 10 took like
73 rounds with an incredible slow push into their territory and
many failed blitz attempts. I won 12 by depleting the enemy&#8217;s last
unit&#8217;s gas after their fighter killed my last plan and I had
defeated all their ground units honestly. Mission 14 took a ton of
attempts, probably four or five, and ended up going into 47
rounds. Mission 17 took a little over an hour to beat. (Basic math
tells me that each mission has taken on average about 40 minutes.)
It&#8217;s interesting how much mileage the game provides.</p>

<p>The story is ridiculous just like the last game but in like the
totally opposite direction. The first game I played was very &#8220;Rah
rah&#8221; about world and treated it (in the story) like a silly game
with no consequences. This game is all about the evils of war and
of humanity in general with the main characters being pure divine
beings of goodness and everyone else being totally
detestable. It&#8217;s pretty absurd. If there were voice-acting, it
would be the worst. The situation they are in is actually really
similar to Battlestar Galactica, but if all the bad guys on that
show were the ones in charge and the people at the edges were
trying to be good. I&#8217;m tempted to not even watch the story scenes
they are so ridiculous, but I&#8217;m doing it anyways.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a very cute movie. There were a lot of cute moments. I
felt like the people in it were unrealistically mean to basically
everyone. I read the Wikipedia page and it talked about the real
couple was very religious and credit God for keeping them
together. It would have been nice to acknowledge that it
someway&#8230; but the couple in the movie weren&#8217;t even married in a
church.</p>

<p>I think my favourite parts of the movie were the very subtle signs
of how much they loved each other. Such as rolling up the window
and the cat. Very cute.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played today for a little over an hour. I got through the next
part of the Undead Parish. The Rhino was pretty tough and got me
once. Then I weaved my way around and accidentally stumbled into
the Bell Gargoyle fight. I died the first three times and then
accidentally died on the way. So I lost about 6k souls. Ouch. This
game is definitely great.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours today and got used to the game. I
spent a long time planning my character based on remembering what
was a good strategy in Demon&#8217;s Souls. I&#8217;ll be taking the same
approach: really fast, huge shield, melee focus, but with a good
bow.</p>

<p>The tutorial phase of the game was much shorter and so far the
game seems incredibly linear, which I thought wasn&#8217;t the case, but
maybe I&#8217;m just still in the beginning. Last time I took a very
linear approach through the game, but this time I intend to
explore a bit more.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the game are basically identical. The graphics
seem a little bit better&#8230; primarily in the lightning department,
but I don&#8217;t know if I can really tell or I just have a bad
memory. It seems like this simply <em>is</em> Demon&#8217;s Souls with a little
bit of a different structure&#8212;no hub, Humanity, etc.</p>

<p>That makes it sound like I don&#8217;t like the idea of that, but I&#8217;m
actually very excited about playing it.</p>

<p>During my time tonight, I died twice. Each time against a boss on
my first fight with them. The game seems just as hard as before,
but I&#8217;m getting used to the controls again and learning how the
bosses behave. Overall, it&#8217;s a pretty awesome game.</p>

<p>Here are my current stats (where ! indicates that the stat is at
the level I intend to leave it at for the foreseeable future):</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played tonight for about an hour and beat the last two levels on
my first try (tonight, the second to last level took me about four
or five tries total.) The final level was basically a boss rush
plus a new boss at the end. It was pretty rad.</p>

<p>I concurred with everything I said yesterday. This game is worth
everything I paid for it. ;) I would&#8217;ve probably been happy if I
paid $15 for it. I intend to gradually play through the levels
again on Hard and through the Challenge mode. Probably once a week
on Sunday. I enjoyed the game and it will be in the back of my
mind for a while, but it&#8217;s not a revelation.</p>

<p>I wonder how it is with Kinect or Move?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I got this game as a prize from Call of Podcast for writing about
my game management system. It was on my to-buy list before that,
although I was planning on buying the PS3 version. The game looked
really beautiful and I really like Genki Rockets. I played Rez for
the Dreamcast and wasn&#8217;t really blown away, but I thought that it
might be more interesting in a more modern form.</p>

<p>The game opens up with a really intriguing video and quickly shows
off its unique, beautiful world.</p>

<p>I played it for about an hour and half tonight. I beat the
first three levels on the first try, although I had to do each
twice to unlock the next level. I played the fourth level about
four times, but kept dying at the final form of the boss, because
it shoots so many tracer rounds.</p>

<p>I find the gameplay to be enjoyable and challenging, at least when
you get totally overwhelmed by bullets. I suppose I should get
better at using the screen clearing bombs. The addition of the
tracer rounds seems like it would be an insignificant change, but
it makes a huge difference compared to Rez.</p>

<p>I love the music, although I wish that there were more vocals,
like the actual Genki Rockets song. It may be that I&#8217;m not playing
well enough to unlock them though&#8230; on that note, I dislike how
it seems like I am doing the levels perfect (not getting hit,
getting mostly perfect octo-locks) but I&#8217;m only get three stars a
pop. It&#8217;s weird.</p>

<p>I love that every level is totally different visually and aurally
from the others. This game is the perfect of a game that seems
like it was made on a totally different planet. I&#8217;ve played plenty
of Japanese games that do this, but most Western games lack that
kind of creativity.</p>

<p>I intend to keep trucking at it and beat. I haven&#8217;t yet decided if
I will play through the hard mode or if I will just periodically
play through the whole game when I want to chill out to some rad
music, or show someone the game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The wife and I watched two more episodes. The game continues to be
really funny. A little thing I really liked that we noticed today
was that the voice of York is different when he is hearing himself
talk than when the camera is from a third-person perspective. Very
subtle, but neat. Something I enjoy about the narrator guy is that
he talks so matter-of-factly about some of the strange stuff going
in the game. It adds to the absurdity.</p>

<time datetime="2012-05-14T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>14</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading this book for a few weeks. It&#8217;s just
terrible.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about 550 pages where every one has the text of a verse from
the Book of <em>REDACTED</em> and then a series of questions underneath it
like &#8220;What does X mean?&#8221; &#8220;What does (something tangentially related
to X) mean?&#8221; &#8220;What does Y mean?&#8221; etc. It does this over and over
and over, with almost no answers. Sometimes the questions are
incredibly obvious or trivial, like the verse will say &#8220;follow the
Prophet&#8221; and the questions will be something like &#8220;What does it
/really/ mean to follow?&#8221; &#8220;No, REALLY what does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>I get the impression that the author has deep, and perhaps
controversial, opinions about these things, but doesn&#8217;t want to
express them clearly because he&#8217;s afraid of being reprimanded by
the Church or being held accountable in anyway.</p>

<p>Sometimes the questions are so leading, you can see what opinion he
is trying to express, but is unwilling to do it openly. For
example, he has a list of questions related to the details of the
sacrament ordinance with all sorts of questioning about when it is
okay to change ordinances. It is pretty clear to me he&#8217;s implying
something bad about the changes in the temple ordinances. But,
again he doesn&#8217;t actually say this.</p>

<p>In addition to this frivolous questions, there&#8217;s saccharine
comments like, &#8220;Man this Book of <em>REDACTED</em> is pretty important, huh? I
can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so great&#8221; that sound like staged humility.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s plausible that this guy&#8217;s other books contain interesting
stuff, but I don&#8217;t think he can use the commentary format effectively.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really rad movie. It had a similar amazing look as 300,
but was much more fantasy oriented. The actions of the Gods in the
movie are awesome and not quite like anything I&#8217;d ever seen
before. The actions are the humans are exciting and down to Earth
in a neat contrasting way. Mickey Rourke does an amazing job as a
crazy warlord. The movie is a really great spectacle piece and is
totally worth it just for the way the Greek Gods are presented.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a cool spy-action movie. I like how it emphasizes the
&#8220;soft&#8221; part of spy work (but not as much as something like
/Spygame/.) And, I think the fight scenes are really cool because
they are so slow and feel realistic. In a strange way, her
controlled fighting makes it almost less exciting, because she
seems so confident and in control all the time. There was lots of
neat camera work&#8212;mainly during the chase sequences. And, the
structuring of the story telling (in the beginning, she&#8217;s narrating
to someone else) is interesting. The one thing I think could have
been a lot better about the movie was the final reveal: the reason
for the betrayal could have been more meaningful and cooler. But,
overall, it was a pretty rad movie. I can imagine watching more
movies with Gina Carano starring.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played another 30-ish minutes of the game. I decided that I&#8217;m
not interested enough in this game to play it. The story seems
fine, maybe a bit cliche. The interesting thing to me was the
setting of the intro movie, which was abandoned pretty instantly
and now I&#8217;m on random medieval planet (like the first three
games.) I&#8217;ll ignore a boring story if the gameplay is awesome,
but&#8230;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember what the combat system was like for the third
game (I remember liking it, but I feel like it was similar to
this) but I&#8217;m not compelled by this one at all. It&#8217;s a cross
between way too easy and way too frustrating. For example, most
battles can be won by simply pressing X over and over. There&#8217;s a
&#8220;blindside&#8221; system, but it&#8217;s basically impossible to use when you
are ganged up on, and when you aren&#8217;t ganged up on, you can just
time your attacks to never need to dodge. It&#8217;s frustrating that
you can&#8217;t really use it well. The targeting system is really
frustrating because it never seems to go where you want and
there&#8217;s no way to lock on to a target. The field is really bad,
because sometimes you&#8217;ll run at an enemy from behind, but the hit
detection is off, so you end up getting them from the side and you
get a Surprise attack, even though you clearly snuck up on them
from behind. Argh! The controls in combat are really laggy with
hidden timers or something. This is the worst when it comes to
jumping. You&#8217;ll hit the button and then have a noticeable delay
before the jump happens.</p>

<p>The game aspires to feel like a third-person action game, but it&#8217;s
not good enough at it to make the comparison a good thing. It
pales in comparison to Bayonetta. I don&#8217;t think I have the time
and interest to play 50 hours (the median time on
HowLongToBeat.com) of something that is not totally amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve played tri-Ace games released after this, because I
can imagine that if I played this on release, I would be skeptical
of their ability to continue to deliver hits. But, Resonance of
Fate was amaaaazing, so tri-Ace still has it.</p>

<p>So long, Star Ocean.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie has a very unique and interesting premise: a dystopia
where vampires have become the norm and humans are rare. The
beginning of the movie, where you learn about what normal vampire
culture is like, is the best and most interesting part of the
movie. The rest of it lacks any unifying idea that brings it
weight. The cure is discovered to be controlled sunlight, but no
explanation is given why this would work. The cure turns out to be
contagious, so when a former vampire is fed from the feeder is
cured. There&#8217;s no explanation offered, although I would have liked
some pseudo-science. The rest of the movie is some pretty routine
chase and fight sequences. The movie feels very much like an
allegory about American imperialism and the ethic of kids who join
the military, combined with standard liberal concerns about oil,
etc. The other great missed opportunity is more guilt and attention
given to the main &#8220;bad guy&#8220;&#8216;s interaction with his daughter.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the movie was a disappointment. It wasn&#8217;t totally
terrible; I can definitely think of worse movies. But the majority
of what I got out of it, I would have had by just reading the
Wikipedia page.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour tonight and mainly did story and
exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven&#8217;t
really been captured by it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The combat system
doesn&#8217;t seem as advanced as I&#8217;d like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I&#8217;ll keep playing, but I&#8217;m a bit sad I
haven&#8217;t been totally won over by it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
&#8220;Inn&#8221; to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.</p>

<p>In a small way I&#8217;ve been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There&#8217;s just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.</p>

<p>I think doing one &#8220;episode&#8221; per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve played the first and third Star Ocean games and really
enjoyed them. I generally like everything that tri-Ace does, so
I&#8217;m looking forward to this game. I like the idea of the enhanced
PS3 version, but I don&#8217;t really know anything about the game or
about what is enhanced about this release.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour in my first session. The concept of the
world is pretty cool. It&#8217;s the first Star Ocean I can think of
that has Earth as a real place. I wonder if it is supposed to be
in the same continuity as the other games? The gameplay seems like
it will be cool. The battle system tutorial was incredibly
complicated and I did during the battle three times before
winning. That makes me hopeful, although a little bit of the time
I felt like I was losing because I couldn&#8217;t target the thing I
wanted. The graphics are pretty good, although the characters are
verrry anime-y and from some angles their clothes really clash
with their faces. (For example, the guy on the computer screen
that Edge talks to.) The controls are responsive.  Although the
camera controls are a little too &#8220;tight&#8221; for my taste so far. I
got a little stuck walking around in the space ship. I think the
problem is that the world is so &#8220;bright&#8221; that it&#8217;s hard to notice
something you can bump into. Anyways, the majority of the time was
spent in videos, so I don&#8217;t really have a good feel for the game
yet.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I decided based on some consultation with forum posts, etc, that I
will watch a long play of the game, rather than play through it
myself. The gameplay is so bad and I want to see everything, but
don&#8217;t want to play with a walkthrough. It&#8217;s more efficient to just
watch it. I found two playthroughs: <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D3368004">a 100% playthrough</a> and [[http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/deadly-premonition/5058/endurance-run-download-urls/417644/][a
GiantBomb Endurance Run]]. I&#8217;m not sure which one will be better, so
I&#8217;ll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We&#8217;ll see how that goes&#8230;</p>

incomprehensible, but who cares, or expects better? The visuals
were really amazing. I was kind of annoyed that Megan Fox wasn&#8217;t in
it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn&#8217;t work for what they had the girl do, but I don&#8217;t
see why that was a necessary plot point. Either way, the whole
movie was some good stupid fun.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn&#8217;t load my Clear data, so I&#8217;m
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.</p>

<p>It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war&#8230; especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!</p>

<p>The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the &#8220;stealth&#8221; missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you&#8217;d make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)</p>

<p>I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don&#8217;t think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I&#8217;ve got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it&#8217;s mainly the story pushing me to do more.</p>

<p>It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren&#8217;t counted
in the real total. Wow!</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I bought this game because I heard so many good things about it on
podcasts, particularly the &#8220;WARNING: A Huge Podcast&#8221;
special. Before playing it, I&#8217;m slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won&#8217;t want to. (I don&#8217;t want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don&#8217;t bother me because there&#8217;s just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn&#8217;t finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I&#8217;m
giving it a chance, but if it doesn&#8217;t take me in one night, I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll keep playing it.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn&#8217;t hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it&#8217;s all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.</p>

<p>The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the &#8220;gas stand&#8221; is.)</p>

<p>The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don&#8217;t really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it&#8217;s disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it&#8217;s also not very effective. There&#8217;s not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.</p>

<p>The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I&#8217;m slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I&#8217;ll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I&#8217;ll give it more time.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a very funny movie. It magnifies standard romantic comedy

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the &#8220;Undodgeable
Shot&#8221; ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn&#8217;t
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D&#8217;oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia&#8212;he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It&#8217;s
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It&#8217;s spectacular.</p>

<p>The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don&#8217;t really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.</p>

<p>The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don&#8217;t mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn&#8217;t receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don&#8217;t
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn&#8217;t get
from the movie. For example, the daughter&#8217;s name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Thinking about this movie the day after, there are some things
really strange about it:</p>

<p>All the movies more or less establish the vampires as basically in
the right, with the werewolves being too uncontrolled to be safe
for humans. Almost as if the vampires are protecting humans from
the immortals&#8212;especially given that they have a cultural
imperative to not consume human blood. (Viktor is a &#8220;bad&#8221; vampire
almost entirely because he sometimes breaks this rule.)</p>

<p>The first movie mixes this a little bit, portraying Lucian as
having been wronged and the vampires, especially Viktor, overly
prejudiced. But, it doesn&#8217;t give Lucian any motives other than
revenge on vampires. Given that he is involved in offensive action,
it&#8217;s not as if the vampires are simply out to get him. The war is
reciprocal.</p>

<p>The second movie really lays on the thick that danger of the
werewolves with the flash back sequences, but otherwise doesn&#8217;t
really develop the reason for the conflict. It&#8217;s basically just
sibling rivalry. (The movie is also weird because it makes very
little sense that Markus would act as he does now, as opposed to in
any of the previous 100 year periods where he was the sole reigning
vampire elder. It&#8217;s especially incomprehensible why he destroys his
coven.)</p>

<p>The third movie doesn&#8217;t really explain why Lucian would continue to
fight the vampires. It presents him as unassailably moral and a
freedom fighter. But once he gets his freedom, why does he have any
reason to continue fighting? Especially given that he thinks Viktor
is dead.</p>

<p>I presume that this won&#8217;t be resolved or explained in the last
movie. But maybe not? It seems like Selene is the oldest vampire
that we&#8217;ve heard of it that is still alive and there has never been
any ranking werewolves other than Lucian and William.</p>

<time datetime="2012-05-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really fascinating movie. It&#8217;s a totally unique dystopia
for me (maybe Wikipedia will tell me about things that are like
it?) and that is always fascinating. The plot is basically Bonnie &amp;
Clyde after an initial glance at the prejudice and hardship in the
system.</p>

<p>The imagery is really cool and there are lots of interesting and
bizarre situations, like the way Wies introduces his female
relatives.</p>

<p>I think the movie lost some good opportunities for character
development. For example, Will gets 30 minutes for lunch at the
beginning but she dies by seconds when she can&#8217;t take the bus, and
was just 20 minutes short of being able to pay for the bus
ride. Yet, he doesn&#8217;t acknowledge this for the sake of the audience
or to show his great remorse, etc.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the movie to be very intriguing. This, however, is
also its biggest problem because it begs you to think about it
deeply and the world isn&#8217;t explained well enough.</p>

<p>For example, there&#8217;s a strong suggestion that the mantra &#8220;For few to
be immortal, many must die&#8221; has some sort of quasi-mystical and
dreadful significance. Like there is some sort of Big Brother type
that is keeping people down. However, this isn&#8217;t followed through.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Time Keepers is not explained adequately. On one
level, they are simply cops and since money is time, they are
connected to time. However, in the end, when they&#8217;re talking about
how &#8220;that much money can&#8217;t leave that zone&#8221; and many other
situations, you get the impression that there is some deeper
purpose to their actions.</p>

<p>Similarly, the movie has poor economics. For example, what effect
does birth have, given that it introduces a year of time? If the
time is a real commodity&#8212;i.e. an abstraction of some sort of
energy their bodies need, rather than a fiat system (i.e. they are
like nanomachines that keep track of the time and just kill you
when it is zero.)&#8212;then where does the new year come from? How
could there be such price controls?</p>

<p>I think the movie could have resolved this better by coming up with
some sort of origin story and pseudo-science to explain why people
would choose to live like this (and everyone!) at some point
voluntarily and how it works. I think the fiat system would have
been interesting, because it makes it so there&#8217;s actually a
solution that they could possibly reach. But, as it is, we can&#8217;t
imagine that Will and Sylvia will ever actually fix
anything&#8230; other than what communists and Robin Hoods try to do
and fail to do in the real world.</p>

<p>The movie is very confused, therefore, with what its message (and
the message of its heroes) really is. Philippe spouts
pseudo-Capitalism, so perhaps the movie is anti-Capitalism? Yet,
the corruption of the Time Keepers vis a vis Fortis is reminiscent
of the relationship between the US and e.g. African dictators. So,
is it an anti &#8220;Globalization&#8221; or &#8220;Imperialist&#8221; politic?</p>

<p>I think because they don&#8217;t foreshadow a solution or great evil
through technology or metaphysics, the world must be a &#8220;natural&#8221;
world and so the villain must be natural, and they rhetoric of the
movie leaves nothing left but a political agenda. Yet, it doesn&#8217;t
articulate what the agenda is.</p>

<p>The movie is good for making it possible to think of it like this,
but it is bad because by not answering these questions, it is
incoherent and vapid.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about 33 minutes today and basically just learned
that Alicia really is a Valkyria and she&#8217;s super tough. I lost the
battle pretty hard, because I did a stealth rush and couldn&#8217;t
defend the forward base. Now that I know where the enemy will be,
I think I will try to pre-place Lancers behind the where the tanks
appear! We&#8217;ll see tomorrow.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I was really surprised by the quality of this movie. I assumed that
because it didn&#8217;t star Kate Beckinsale it would be a cheap version
of the world. But actually, I think it is the best yet; although it
wouldn&#8217;t be very good without the first movie, obviously. It gives
a lot better context to the first movie and makes a lot of what
seems strange about the mythology a lot more reasonable. The story
is a lot more coherent and reasonable and the action is noticeably
slower, so you can appreciate it a bit more.</p>

<p>The development of the romance between Lucian and Sonja is totally
ignored, apart from a glance when they are kids.</p>

<p>Rhona Mitra really does look like Kate Beckinsale.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that the giant black werewolf from the first scene of the
first movie is one of Lucian&#8217;s oldest friends. A nice little nod to
people paying attention.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I did a few more stealth style missions. The big battle in the
trenches was really different and dangerous, although I did it in
a stealth way. The bonus mission where you had to search through
all the grassy areas was pretty cool too.</p>

<p>The story is getting really neat and touching. I can&#8217;t believe
they killed Isara, but I like the way you return to Bruhl as a way
to &#8220;avenge&#8221; her. The development of the idea of Alicia being a
Valkyria is really neat too. I wonder if it will just be in
cut-scenes or if she&#8217;ll become some crazy new unit type? I feel
like the story is close to wrapping up, but there are a lot more
empty boxes in the R&amp;D area, so I suspect that it really isn&#8217;t
that close to being done.</p>

<p>This is still an awesome game. The best part is probably the way
they are constantly developing and adding more and more to the
story and gameplay. It&#8217;s very different than it was in the
beginning, but the path to here has made complete sense.</p>

wasted effort, so I played games rather later to feel some
accomplishment. I played for about 2 hours. I got through all of
chapter 11 and did the skirmish that opened up three times (Easy,
Normal, Normal)&#8230; all As (2 rounds!)&#8230; to get enough money to
buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able
to do it in 2 rounds with only 2 restarts. It was pretty cool to
have a few &#8220;stealth&#8221; levels.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I thought that I hadn&#8217;t seen this movie, but actually I have. Given
when it came out, I think I saw it in the theatres during grad
school. I would often go to the movie theater by myself on boring
nights/afternoons.</p>

<p>I think the production quality on the movie is significantly higher
and the fights are a lot more interesting. They did a good job
introducing new characters that were different. I like the
development of the mythology. Kate Beckinsale continues to look
amazing and she seems to be wearing a slightly different cat-suit.
The monsters look a little less like Buffy villains, but still a
little bit cheesy.</p>

<p>The plot feels a lot simpler, more like a roller-coaster ride where
the characters are chased from one place to the next without much
time for mystery or real plot development. It&#8217;s a bit more of a
standard action movie in that regard, and I think it suffers
compared to the last for it. The cast of meaning characters is a
lot smaller with most (such as Corvinus and Tanis) really only have
one scene. The high point of the movie is probably the set of
flashbacks scenes.</p>

time. Very annoying. I wanted to keep playing tonight, but decided
not to. I wanted to because I&#8217;m curious about what Zaka will be
like&#8230; do I really get another vehicle? I&#8217;m running really low on
money too, so I think I need to play skirmishes a few times to get

<div class="entry-content"><p>I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and &#8220;camera&#8221; changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don&#8217;t feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, because I&#8217;m willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I forget why, but the other day I was reminded of this series. I
decided to start watching it, similar to how I went through the
Resident Evil movies. Like that series, I saw the first one when it
came out, but never saw the others. I remember thinking the movie
was cool and that Kate Beckinsale was amazing attractive.</p>

<p>On a second viewing, significantly older, I still think some parts
of the movie are cool. The mythology is interesting and fairly
developed. The actor of Viktor is pretty awesome; while the actor
that played Kraven was unbelievably bad. The character of Erica is
really interesting and subtle. And, yes, Kate Beckinsale is
woah&#8212;except, I don&#8217;t understand the appeal of the &#8220;cat suits&#8221;,
they make all her natural curves indistinguishable, like a running
bra or something. I don&#8217;t get it, but I guess that had to because
this movie was made to be so Matrix-y. The action sequences are
very derivative of the Matrix and pretty boring overall
actually. Lots of akimbo and chunks of buildings flying off. The
best fight is probably the very first one. Even the final fight
between Viktor and Michael is pretty meh, because Michael is so
&#8220;whatever&#8221; that it doesn&#8217;t get too exciting.</p>

<p>Definitely not a classic, but I&#8217;m interested in watching the rest
of them.</p>

fan-service&#8230; I mean, the beach vacation&#8230; one was funny. The

my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little

Ragnar was the only one left and he would&#8217;ve only last one
hit&#8230; and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.</p>

<p>After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an &#8220;accurate&#8221; polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &amp;

getting pretty rough and un-cheese-able, which is really fun
because it forces me to try different things. I got a really bad
score in the second woodland battle, which was kinda sad, so I did
another skirmish so I could get the XP I missed. I really enjoyed
using the tank a lot in the woodland battle though.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There&#8217;s a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to &#8220;fetch questy&#8221;, but when you actually have
to remember what&#8217;s going on, it feels more real and fun. It&#8217;s an
interesting thing.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named &#8220;Ty the
Immortal&#8221;&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t seem to land a killing hit on him&#8230; maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I&#8217;m sad I didn&#8217;t get an A
on that fight.</p>

<p>I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
&#8220;fantastical&#8221; in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It&#8217;s neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.</p>

<p>The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn&#8217;t cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn&#8217;t go to before. I like it when things like that work out.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)&#8212;getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two&#8212;then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.</p>

<p>I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can&#8217;t do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.</p>

<p>I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can&#8217;t reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can&#8217;t decide that
you&#8217;ve made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don&#8217;t put enough Lancers, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don&#8217;t see why
this is kept from me.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&amp;D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&amp;D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So far I&#8217;m really like the story and the gameplay. It&#8217;s a really
fun game!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer &#8220;trips&#8221; as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.</p>

<p>Torneko&#8217;s chapter was really strange because you&#8217;re trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you&#8217;re doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>My wife read this book for book group (I think that&#8217;s why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn&#8217;t
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn&#8217;t slicey enough because there
aren&#8217;t even interesting vignettes about the girl&#8217;s life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen&#8230; and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That&#8217;s pretty bad. It&#8217;s not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it&#8217;s
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there&#8217;s basically
only one thing that <em>could</em> happen given the way she&#8217;s set it up.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn&#8217;t
for me.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that&#8217;ll be my
method&#8230; whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I&#8217;ll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.</p>

<p>So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can&#8217;t wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.</p>

<p>I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the &#8220;Imps&#8221;, which I reckon means &#8220;Imperials.&#8221; Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a big budget popcorn summer movie, but a pretty good one
of that category. It starts off, and sounds like, it will be just
like all the other movies, with practically the same setup; but it
quickly acknowledges that and goes in a different direction. They
didn&#8217;t over use the faces, like they&#8217;ve done before, and they there
was only one real bad scene of Tom Cruise fawning over himself. I
think my major disappointments were its lack of a romantic sub-plot
and the lack of real consequences to not being able to use IMF
resources&#8212;even though they explicitly mention how that is
standing in their way at a few points, they solve the problem too
easily.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours today. I went through one dungeon
and got to a really hard boss fight. I&#8217;ve been on a pattern of try
the boss then go back to the beginning of the dungeon fighting
dudes and back so I can gain some levels and try again. I think
I&#8217;ve had about 5 or 6 loops so far. It&#8217;s pretty brutal too because
there&#8217;s a medium difficulty boss battle before it that you have to
go through, so each failing boss fight takes about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been talking with my wife about some of the stupid stuff in
this game. The biggest problem with it is the lack of agency in
almost every aspect of the game.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each unit has specific skills, like Smash II or Restore III, but
you don&#8217;t get to choose what skills will actually be
used. Instead, you choose between a few &#8220;baskets&#8221; of
attacks. For example, you might have the option &#8221;<em>REDACTED</em>ge&#8221; which
has your five guys just do basic attacks and then you&#8217;ll also
have &#8220;Attack &#8216;em hard, man&#8221; which has two of your guys do two
seemingly random physical attacks. There&#8217;s no option to just
determine what your units will do.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s not even possible for you to always choose each type of
basket. For example, generally there is a (1) no AP basket, (2)
physical AP basket, (3) magic AP basket, (4) healing AP basket,
and (5) hexing/buffing basket. Each one sometimes has a second
variant that uses much more AP. However, it&#8217;s not the case that
on any given round you can choose between any of the baskets. I
have no idea what algorithm it is using to determine what I am
allowed to do. This is most frustrating with healing. Suppose I
have 2k HP and I&#8217;m fighting something that I know can do 1.2k
damage sometimes. If I get hit and get knocked down past 1.5k,
I&#8217;d like to heal as insurance for the eventually big one. Last
Remnant does not allow this. It only gives you the ability to
heal (and other teams to heal you) when you are really low, for
some unknown definition of really low. In this case, it&#8217;s too
late. It is almost like the FF13 Paradigm system where all the
characters are AI controlled and you aren&#8217;t allowed to switch to
any Paradigm whenever you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Outside of combat, there&#8217;s a similar lack of agency in the
character progression system. You have a whole bunch of
characters, but not one of them gives you the ability to decide
what skills they will learn as they progress. Rush (the main
character) can sometimes choose between two options after a
battle, but you don&#8217;t really have any perspective on this
decision and it&#8217;s very micro. Some of the leaders will ask you
whether to focus on physical or magical attacks, but
repercussions of this are pretty vague. You can&#8217;t change the
equipment on your characters, except for the main one, but you
almost never need to do it (it seems) because there&#8217;s rarely
anything better than what you have or will find in a dungeon in
a little bit.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Despite these big game play problems, I find the core idea pretty
interesting and it&#8217;s tempting to keep playing and grind through it,
but I&#8217;m beginning to think it&#8217;s just not worth given the many other
great games that are available.</p>

<p>I find the story to be pretty intriguing and original. The
production values are pretty bad in a lot of places and some of the
micro-story bits are pretty lame, but it&#8217;s a reasonable package.</p>

<p>I feel real bad putting down games and not playing them to
completion, but I just can&#8217;t get behind such flawed game play.</p>

<p>I was having a discussion with someone the other day about what
makes good game play and I stated three things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Intuition</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The challenge of the game should require some inexplicable skill
that can&#8217;t be feasibly turned into an algorithm by
humans. Tic-Tac-Toe is flawed in this way. A shmup is super easy
to imagine (algorithm: dodge bullets when they get close), but
it&#8217;s basically impossible to succeed with such a system. Most
strategy and role-playing games can get too close to the edge of
easy to axiomatize. Games that /require/ memorization are some of
the worst offenders on this category by going in the opposite
direction from Tic-Tac-Toe; rather than having a deeply
algorithmic structure, they lack any coherence at all, so you
must resort to pure memorization.</p>

<p>The Last Remnant is pretty good in this camp, I think, but the
place where the choice enters in is pretty weak&#8212;primarily in
what order your unions attack what enemy unions and to a lesser
extent how much AP you spend on any turn.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fairness</em></li>
</ul>


<p>When you fail, it should be clear to you that it is your
fault. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should know what to do to succeed,
but rather you should believe that you did something wrong. For
example, Super Mario Brothers is very good with this, except on
the ZX Spectrum, where the lack of scrolling forced you to do
blind jumps.</p>

<p>The Last Remnant is very bad on this category because it&#8217;s lack
of player agency makes you always feel like it was the RNG that
killed you and not your lack of ability/planning/strategy/etc.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Precision</em></li>
</ul>


<p>A complement of Fairness is Precision, which means that you the
burden to communicate your intentions should be reasonable. Mario
is practically perfect here, because there is basically no delay
between your choice and the action and the set of actions (jump,
move, etc) is perfectly matched by the mechanism of choice (the
buttons on the controller.) Many games with complicated control
schemes violate the Precision principle. Many games have bad
input lag and other problems that stand in the way of
precision. Some games seem to violate Precision&#8212;like Street
Fighter, where we could imagine a 3DS style menu of the super
attacks, rather than the high-execution challenge abilities&#8212;but
some how do not, because the commands are tight and seem to flow
out of other actions you are doing anyways, and are coupled with
general tightness and precision. Sometimes a game consciously
makes the control harder as part of the challenge&#8230; DDR is
easier with four buttons that you can control with your fingers,
for example; but this is difficulty design decision to balance
and generally pushes the game from the abstract realm (the
screen) to the physical realm (dancing).</p>

<p>The Last Remnant&#8217;s lack of Fairness almost entirely comes from
its lack of Precision. It is not possible for you to choose your
actions, so you know you should heal but the game prevents
you. It&#8217;s not necessarily the case that lack of Precision leads
to lack of Fairness&#8230; the NES Castlevania games are very chunky
in their control, but somehow maintain Fairness.</p>

<p>So I guess I&#8217;ve decided to abandon The Last Remnant. I just read
the Wikipedia summary of the story and it sounds like it would
have been cool to experience, but it&#8217;s not worth the suffering. I&#8217;m
glad I played it enough to feel like I really understand the
mechanics and gave them a chance, but I think my conscious will be
clear on abandoning the game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn&#8217;t read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn&#8217;t select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I&#8217;d never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time&#8230; which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn&#8217;t.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror&#8217;s
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.</p>

<p>The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can&#8217;t believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;d at least run into her
before.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It&#8217;s not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven&#8217;t
died since I restarted.</p>

<p>I made it through a bunch more areas (I&#8217;m about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don&#8217;t know.) It&#8217;s almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don&#8217;t see
the global path so you don&#8217;t get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn&#8217;t find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
&#8220;side&#8221; quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places&#8230; kind
of a hole&#8230; that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.</p>

variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren&#8217;t totally showing, it gets a little real and that&#8217;s
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop

before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting&#8230; the concept of remnants is neat. They&#8217;re basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I&#8217;m just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don&#8217;t understand how to optimize it,

<div class="entry-content"><p>Based on my last experience with the game, I think I&#8217;m basically
done with the game. I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play&#8212;5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren&#8217;t tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don&#8217;t think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I&#8217;m doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn&#8217;t quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can&#8217;t remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn&#8217;t noticed because I hadn&#8217;t play SMB
yet.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved&#8212;I don&#8217;t know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I&#8217;ve played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear doing it
all over again I don&#8217;t think. At least not right away, I&#8217;ll try
again tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.</p>

<p>First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn&#8217;t unbearable, but it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad &#8220;dead
eye&#8221; syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren&#8217;t great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.</p>

<p>Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.</p>

<p>On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can&#8217;t actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it&#8217;s a strategy
game where positioning isn&#8217;t directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.</p>

<p>On another level, it&#8217;s kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select &#8220;Attack&#8221;, &#8220;Magic&#8221;, or &#8220;Item&#8221; and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey&#8217;s) sometimes during them. Except that you don&#8217;t
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don&#8217;t actually choose
which skills you will use, like &#8220;Magic > Fire&#8221;, you just choose
&#8220;Magic&#8221;. Except that all your skills aren&#8217;t always available, for
example, you can only choose &#8220;Heal&#8221; when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.</p>

<p>It is really strange.</p>

<p>Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven&#8217;t
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles (&#8220;Press A to Win&#8221;-style). Tomorrow
I&#8217;ll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I plan on starting this game today. I thought I&#8217;d write about my
expectations before I played it.</p>

<p>Like Blue Dragon, I&#8217;d heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;next gen&#8221; games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I&#8217;ve heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don&#8217;t
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I&#8217;ve
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don&#8217;t really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.</p>

<p>I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I&#8217;m skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m pretty excited about seeing what it is like.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the rest of the game&#8230; meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn&#8217;t particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn&#8217;t really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn&#8217;t anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn&#8217;t dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There&#8217;s one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can&#8217;t survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it&#8217;s too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I&#8217;m now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I&#8217;ll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene&#8217;s fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight&#8230; wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don&#8217;t think I would have really minded too
much&#8230; unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42&#8230; which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I&#8217;m liking Maru more and more. He&#8217;s so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene&#8217;s mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He&#8217;s not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they&#8217;ll get them
back and save the day&#8230; but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>

interesting, although very unfulfilled from the part of the game.</p>

<p>I got all the skills for a few classes, so I&#8217;ve made my first
class changes. I spent some time looking through what the choices
are to make a plan for where I want the characters to end up. They
feel quite a bit weaker now that they&#8217;ve dropped levels. It was
annoying to not have Kluke for so long because of that power
difference.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I started from the beginning of Disc 2 and went to the
Ancient Prison. There weren&#8217;t a lot of boss battles today, but
they were a few and a few more mini-bosses (seemingly unique
enemies, but without the boss battle music.) I got a lot of
equipment upgrades, but didn&#8217;t gain many levels, either overall or
ranks in my classes. I wouldn&#8217;t say there was anything hard today
either.</p>

<p>The story had a few revelations today. Most interesting was the
idea that the Ancients have not been seen in 10,000 years and that
Nene is one of these ancients&#8230; presumably the last one who &#8220;won&#8221;
the war and therefore is the &#8220;king&#8221; of the world, but lives so
secretively and without the need to interact with people, he&#8217;s
effectively a force of nature from their perspective, and only
chooses to interact in so much as to bug them. Yet, he has
recently had some problems with his age, so he needs to use
Ancient technology again, but can&#8217;t find it. (That&#8217;s what you get
for killing everyone, I guess.) Although, the above summary is
definitely my surmise and not something the game explains.</p>

<p>This is an interesting concept, but the game doesn&#8217;t uses its
curiosity as much as I am expanding on it in my head.</p>

<p>There were a few cute more things. I think my favourite was the
Pyre-Rat. The emotion of the machines sacrificing themselves was
very real.</p>

<p>I took a glance at a FAQ&#8217;s TOC to see how far I was in the game
and it appears that I am near the end of this Disc, which is
strange to me, but maybe one of the final areas takes a long time?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I have not needed to grind, because I would probably
quit.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played tonight a lot and got to the second disc.</p>

<p>Today there were a couple dumb mini-games: the wagon escort
mission and the MechaCat shooting segment. They weren&#8217;t miserable,
but they weren&#8217;t fun.</p>

<p>In Mural Town, I learned more about the world, which was kind of
interesting. It used to have magic, then it had robots, then
everything was destroyed. Still no real explanation of what&#8217;s the
deal with the world though.</p>

<p>In Jibral, there&#8217;s a really big town but it kind of loses
direction and you wander around aimlessly. I know some people like
stuff like this, because they feel like they can really explore,
etc, but I don&#8217;t like it. I want focused, tight
experiences. Especially when exploration isn&#8217;t necessarily fun
(e.g., in Castlevania it is fun to traverse and you fight things
on the way.)</p>

<p>I agree with Maru that Zola is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The final area of the disc was pretty epic. I like it when disc
changes are accompanied by awesomeness and not just running out of
space. There was a good boss rush and I actually died for the
first time against the knife throwing one. (My magic users were
Silenced and two attackers were Paralyzed and she spammed the
&#8220;Knife Rain&#8221; attack.) The fights were pretty tense tonight, which
was fun.</p>

<p>By today, they&#8217;ve firmly established that the plot is to take out
Nene, but I realized why I think it is weak. It&#8217;s because the
characters themselves are so empty. They have no personal desires
or hurdles they need to overcome. They are more than totally blank
though: each has an archetype based on their relationship with
their parents. Whatev, I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not as crazy about
the motivation.</p>

<p>My class ranks are about 26 now. I looked in the instruction book
and it says that most classes top out at level 36 in terms of what
skills they get. I wonder what I&#8217;ll choose for my number twos?</p>

<p>I wonder if my 14-hour through disc 1 should just be multiplied by
3 to get the today time? That would be about 40
hours. HowLongToBeat.com lists as having about 37 hours average
for normal playthroughs. I can&#8217;t imagine doing a lot of bonus
content, so I expect I&#8217;m on track.</p>

<time datetime="2012-04-01T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>01</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game a lot today in a bunch of different
chunks&#8230; about 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the middle of
the day, and then 2, 2 hour chunks at night. I&#8217;m not totally
positive that the game didn&#8217;t keep track of time when I had it
paused, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that accounting is accurate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve begun to understand the game a lot more mechanically.</p>

<p>For example, the key strategy in the battle system is to take out
enemies before they can get in attacks, so you have to sometimes
attack the ones early in the battle order and sometimes late,
essentially wagering that you&#8217;ll be able to kill that one, but not
that one, etc. An interesting side effect of this is the charging
system. Sometimes you want to &#8220;over charge&#8221; an attack so that you
go past some other character&#8217;s turn, so they will kill the target
and your attack will be inherited on the next. So suppose that
Monster A is in the front row with low HP and you have a bigger
hitter followed by a weak hitter, you could charge a big attack
past the weak person&#8217;s turn, then kill Monster A with the weak
guy, so the big attack will hit something in the Back Row (now the
Front Row because the Front has been cleared.) This is not as
strategic as an actual TRPG or FF13, etc, but it is pretty
neat. Also, there&#8217;s a very fleshed out elemental weakness system
that you have to pay attention to.</p>

<p>I discovered that the skills from classes can be
mixed-and-matched, although I have not yet got a single rank in
any other class. I feel like I need to totally know what is
available before investing in creating a build.</p>

<p>The exploration structure is very Final Fantasy. You never really
need to find a &#8220;base&#8221; to grind from. I have not grinded at all. I
have barely used any items either. I just take my time and explore
areas so I can get all the chests.</p>

<p>Overall, the mechanics are interesting enough. The battle system
is simple and turn-based, but the entering/exiting of it is fast
enough to not be a pain. It&#8217;s not totally mindless. But I wouldn&#8217;t
say I love it.</p>

<p>The story is pretty meh. I&#8217;ve been playing for 10 hours and I
don&#8217;t really know a lot about the world or anything. Just that
Nene is a jerk, for apparently no reason, and he seems to have
some ominous purpose with us. Nothing special.</p>

<p>The game really shines in its Dragon-Quest-like cleverness:
- Monsters named &#8220;Acornivores&#8221;
- The Devee dance party
- Maru&#8217;s dad saying he has enough energy to have at least one or
two more kids, when there are hordes of them running around.
- Monsters that smack their hands on their bums before entering
battle.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/03/31/Game--Blue-Dragon--X360--2007--0/">Game: Blue Dragon (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-03-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I started this game tonight.</p>

<p>Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law&#8217;s house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.</p>

<p>But, I never bought the game until this January&#8212;almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.</p>

<p>Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I&#8217;ve grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.</p>

<p>I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.</p>

<p>I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, &#8220;Anime!&#8221; It&#8217;s a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.</p>

<p>In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l&#8217;Cie. Then they escape.</p>

<p>Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don&#8217;t really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than &#8220;Get Home&#8221;. I presume they&#8217;ll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?</p>

<p>The battle system is very traditional. There&#8217;s no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can&#8217;t act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you&#8217;ll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don&#8217;t want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn&#8217;t really explained.</p>

<p>I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.</p>

<p>Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don&#8217;t get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.</p>

<p>The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That&#8217;s a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there&#8217;s isn&#8217;t a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.</p>

<p>The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven&#8217;t really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can&#8217;t heal him
over it and I&#8217;m nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I&#8217;m spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.</p>

<p>I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won&#8217;t give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little &#8220;Poo Piles&#8221; that say &#8220;(squish)
(squish)&#8221; when you search them. Nice!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We watched this movie tonight. I heard a lot about it when it came
out, suggesting that it was a lame movie, but with some cool 3D
effects. Obviously I didn&#8217;t watch it in 3D, but I found the normal
effects and the story to actually be pretty cool. I was
impressed. Obviously it is very Fern Gully, but there a lot of
other cool stuff going on to. It&#8217;s the good kind of science fiction
where you know there is a lot more to the world than you can
see. The concept of the electrical connection between all the
different creatures is really cool. The plot, and a lot of specific
actions, are both really predicable and telegraphed clearly, but
hey, it&#8217;s pretty fun. Wikipedia claims there will be sequels. That
could be cool.</p>

I never noticed in the others that you need to beat a relatively
low local-high score (30) to even complete it, but it is very
difficult to get that many ghosts in this, because there aren&#8217;t
sleeper ghosts. I&#8217;ll have to study it more to do it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this on opening day, because my wife was going with some
friends and someone fell through, so I took the last ticket. I have
never read the books, so I don&#8217;t really have opinions or
predilections about it. I thought the world was neat. They did a
good job showing the opulence of the people in the capitol, but I
don&#8217;t think they really made the oppression disgusting enough. The
action was fun and she was pretty heroic&#8212;I found myself tearing
up a few times. I find the world to be pretty unbelievable
though. I don&#8217;t understand how the people in the capitol could be
supportive of the oppression, when they don&#8217;t seem to be kept in
the dark or otherwise &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; into thinking that they are
doing great things for the districts. Similarly, I don&#8217;t understand
why they would not take better care of the districts or why the
districts would not have already gone on strike. The idea that this
could go on for 74 years strains credulity. I don&#8217;t think Katniss
is a very consistent character. The movie communicated to me that
she was all about doing the right thing and would rather die than
not do that; yet, she doesn&#8217;t do a whole lot against &#8220;the man&#8221;. For
example, when she talks to Peter at night before the games start,
he says he wants to show that he is not &#8220;owned&#8221; and she agrees, but
says she&#8217;d like to go home. The way this scene plays out and how
she is so non-aggressive during the games said to me that she
really agreed with him. Yet, she never actually does anything to go
against them. Dying together at the end is a little bit like that,
but you get the impression that she knew they wouldn&#8217;t let her do
it, and therefore it was an empty calculation rather than a
confident objection. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I
felt like it could be more. My wife says that it is part one of a
trilogy and my wishes will come true in some way in the
future. That&#8217;s fine&#8230; but&#8230; it&#8217;s annoying when you need to know
something about the real world to appreciate a movie&#8230; when it
can&#8217;t satisfy you on its own.</p>

something really funny about Dragon Quest. He said something like,
&#8220;Dragon Quest is quintessentially Japanese because it is based on
the premise that success comes from putting in the hours of time,
not acquiring skill.&#8221; They then discussed how Japanese people love
lines and have many meaningless &#8220;put in the hours&#8221; work and study
experiences. I&#8217;ve heard this before, but it is interesting to hear
it discussed as a fundamental feature of Dragon Quest: anyone can
beat it no matter how good they are. I actually think a lot of
modern games are like that, and that&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t like about
them.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played this game in Arcade mode today (normally, I play it once
a month and I&#8217;ve been doing Ragnar&#8217;s story) and got to the end. I
think I will try some of the other characters over the next little
bit, but I&#8217;ll practically consider it mostly done. I like Street
Fighter much more given my experience with this game. The story is
super super Anime. The graphics are gorgeous. But, the systems are
not as appealing or intuitive to me, but I have more experience
with SF, so I like it better.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This an intense movie. It has a very surreal fighting choreography
style that is reminiscent of Crouching Tiger but much more
crazy. Each of the shinobi have very diverse and interesting
&#8220;arts&#8221;. I love how the main characters seem like the wimps the
whole movie until they are finally forced to fight and they have
The Real Ultimate Power. It&#8217;s very cool. The movie is also
incredibly sad and emotional; it is fittingly tragic for a Romeo &amp;
Juliet-like story. I love the resolve of Oboro at the end. She&#8217;s
super tough.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-20T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is on par with the last one and perhaps a slight step
down. It is much less globe-trotting, with essentially four
sets&#8212;the Tokyo office (small), Alaska (small), the LA Prison
(large), and the Arcadia (small).</p>

<p>The opening fight is caraaaazy and has a lot of the elements of the
third movie where you think you&#8217;re watching <em>the Alice</em> but
aren&#8217;t. I was disappointed that Alice lost her powers almost
instantly, but I think it is probably good for the movie that she
lost them, because they make her too unstoppable&#8230; but it still
fun to have her as a super hero. They don&#8217;t explain at all how she
recovers from the crash, separates from Wesker, doesn&#8217;t reconnect
to her supplies / more clones in Nevada, etc. But whatever :)</p>

<p>The Claire pick-up is kind of strange at the time, but the
resolution of what she was doing is pretty awesome by the end of
the movie. It was a genuine surprise and I liked it a lot. By the
way, Ali Larter. Wow.</p>

<p>One of the worst things about this movie is how horrible the actor
who plays Wesker is. He&#8217;s way to stiff and &#8220;too cool for school&#8221;. I
can see what he was going for&#8230; by not moving very much he&#8217;s
trying to act above the situation, but it comes across as really
stupid.</p>

<p>The ultimate action of the movie is strange because it is
practically a meaningless excursion&#8212;only Chris and Luther survive
and Luther barely does. It doesn&#8217;t really do anything to advance
the mythos, just that Wesker is a tough guy and Umbrella continues
to experiment on people. I&#8217;d like them pursue that fact that really
only Umbrella has a chance of saving the world and if they weren&#8217;t
such punks, Alice should be helping them. What does she expect to
do? She really has no motivation besides revenge and helping out
survivors (but mostly they just die because she&#8217;s around.) I found
it interesting in the beginning that she clearly blames herself for
the outbreak. Is she referring to planning a robbery? Or being
involved in the first movie? It&#8217;s unclear what she is talking
about.</p>

<p>The new kinds of zombies in this movie are interesting and appear
with almost no notice by the characters. The &#8220;Majini&#8221; zombies are
super creepy. The big &#8220;butcher&#8221; guy was weird; I expected him to be
like a rogue Nemesis, but they don&#8217;t really go into at all.</p>

<p>The ending is pretty insane. First, Wikipedia says that a figure
parachutes away from the explosion of Wesker&#8217;s plane, but I didn&#8217;t
see that. (Just watched a video of that and it&#8217;s pretty clear. When
I first saw the ending, I didn&#8217;t realize what the smudge in the
background was, but now it is clear.) Weird. Second, every movie
ends with an opening for the next movie, but 2 and 3 end of very
happy resolutions. 1 is less happy, but still Alice is in a
position of control and power. This ending is a pretty bad
cliff-hanger because they are literally about to be blown
away. Where are all these Umbrella goons hiding? It was not at all
clear to me that the woman in command of the attack was Jill
Valentine, because she had different hair color. Weird. (I watched
the ending again and it still doesn&#8217;t look like her, but the voice
sounds just like her.)</p>

<p>As I was watching, my PS3 detected a Cinavia watermark. What cool
technology! I had to switch to watching on the PC.</p>

<p>It is interesting that this movie made significantly more money
than the others. Good for them. The production value is definitely
up from the others. (Although I&#8217;d say that only the second was
&#8220;bad&#8221; on that front. The first wasn&#8217;t good, but I think it was good
for its time.)</p>

<p>Regarding the Wikipedia summary of the reception: I agree that
there is a large amount of slow motion which seems incredibly
tedious&#8212;especially in Claire&#8217;s fight in the shower. The action is
slower paced in general, but I think that is good, because you can
appreciate it more.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-19T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>19</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the last one and really
quite good overall. The plot really goes totally off the game
plots, but in a neat way. It&#8217;s basically a post-apocalyptic zombie
story, with a convoy of survivors doing what they can. A character
is named Claire Redfield, but doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do
(except for her outfit) with Claire from the games. It takes the
sci-fi aspects of the last movie and ups the ante a lot, giving
Alice more powerful psychic powers (like we shown at the very end
of 2); in addition to going bigger and bigger. We&#8217;ve gone from
mansion to city and now to world. The acting is fine&#8212;again
there&#8217;s basically no character development for anyone but the bad
guy and Alice, but the one-dimensional characters are playing
stronger and more interesting archetypes, so it&#8217;s fine. The ending
is totally absurd, as usual and guarantees the next movie will be
insane. The most clever part is the way the Alice clones act (and
are treated) and how the &#8220;domesticated&#8221; zombie acts. It&#8217;s really
interesting movie, actually. The deserted Vegas Strip is kind of
neat, but underused.</p>

<p>On Wikipedia, I was surprised to find that it got worse ratings
than the last one, but it sold more (maybe&#8230; inflation?) so that
suggested it was better received. Wikipedia mentioned digital
airbrushing, which I noticed too. Very weird.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-18T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>18</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This movie is a noticeable step down from the last one. It has a
much more typical horror movie structure. It has some pretty loose
plot elements&#8211;for example, why does Jill know that zombies should
be killed by being shot in the head? How can Dr. Ashford find his
daughter on the computer but the official Umbrella people have lost
her? How does his daughter stay safe, despite being in the same
room as the zombie kids? (BTW, I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t kill any kids.)</p>

<p>There are some pretty funny parts that are surprisingly subtle for
a movie like this. For example, Nemesis is instructed to &#8220;Kill all
STARS&#8221; and carefully avoids the civilian (LJ) with his seemingly
un-targeted Gatling gun fire. The Nemesis&#8217; display is clearly meant
to look like a video game HUD.</p>

<p>Overall, it much more like a random action movie with zombie
elements&#8212;something that is actually kind of rare&#8212;I think the
closest analogue is something like Underworld or Van Helsing. The
Nemesis looks straight-out of Buffy or Angel&#8230; a really
low-budgeting looking costume. The super-heroism of Alice is just
like Buffy too.</p>

<p>Like the last movie, it ends setting up the sequel, where now Alice
has been revived from the dead (or something?) and has even more
super powers, as well as some strange Umbrella influence.</p>

<p>I thought the actress that played Jill looked perfect for the part
and that made it more apparent how ridiculous her outfit really
is. The real problem is that she, and no character other than LJ,
Angela (barely), and Alice have any character history or
development.</p>

<p>Overall, I can&#8217;t say I like this. <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20040910/REVIEWS/409100304/1023">Roger Ebert&#8217;s review</a> is funny;
&#8220;The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no
reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason
to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without
interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and
special effects. [&#8230;] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say
they liked this movie, do not let them date your children.&#8221;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Some of the levels in the game are just too absurd. For example,
Episode 39, level 1 has you do the same challenge over and over
again. The game just isn&#8217;t very streamlined in the teaching
you. You feel like you know how to do something but are forced to
do it again, even though you aren&#8217;t really dying and
restarting. Obviously I&#8217;ll still be it, but it&#8217;s very
annoying. The worst thing about the game is having to do 5 at a
time.</p>

further&#8212;with Marc having to invent more and more rules as he
attempts to give people good morals and get them
happy. Nevertheless, as it stands, it&#8217;s just a normal romcom with a
really fascinating premise at its core.</p>

it&#8212;as far as random action movies are enjoyable. The second time
around I continued enjoying it on that level. The CG effects are
pretty poorly integrated, but other than that it is really an on
par movie. I don&#8217;t mind that the movie doesn&#8217;t directly reference
anything in the game, because I think that it definitely feels like
it could be in the same universe. I enjoy that about it&#8230; it is
not stuck with decisions of the games and can do its own thing. On
the other hand, I read the original script by George Romero and
that it was pretty awesome and would have made a much better,
awesome movie.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I really loved this movie. The plot is great. The story is very
subtle. For example, in an early scene George pressures Yukari into
a love hotel, seemingly to rape her, but I found it to be
incredibly clear that his real intentions were to force her to
stand up for herself by ensuring that inaction would lead to
something she definitely couldn&#8217;t accept. It&#8217;s got all the elements
of a great movie: fun, cute people, drama, love, beautiful
costumes, etc. At many times in the movie, I thought it was going
to go one way, but was wrong. For example, at one point their
consignment clothes are returned and they give up working together;
I assumed that Yukari&#8212;with her school skills&#8212;would create some
sort of advertising campaign and make their business work. Nope. I
like being surprised though. =) The music was also awesome.</p>

it 5 times in row, but couldn&#8217;t get past. It is interesting to
watch him play, because it makes you think about the game
differently. Avoiding a Goomba just requires jumping, because they
come to you. Getting over the pipes just requires jumping and
holding Right against it. But, a pit requires a little bit of a
run and jump at the right time.</p>

he would press the A button and I would aim, but then he&#8217;d get
bored and just smash it to cause a failure so he could pick a new
character. We primarily played it because he saw the Dreamcast

it seemed pretty shameless in its appeal to the Academy for awards:

<div class="entry-content"><p>The flashbacks are interesting, but I wonder how they can
relevant. I don&#8217;t feel like they answer big questions about the
characters, they just seem to be elaborating some of the
characters we already know about them. Even Gaius/Caprica and
Laura&#8217;s things tell us new things about them, but we already
believed those characters traits. I&#8217;m kind of surprised that
Gaius would really go with Galactica and I still wonder what he
could do there. How will the story resolve what the deal is with
his &#8220;destiny&#8221; and his &#8220;angel&#8221;? I&#8217;m glad that Boomer is trying to
help Hera (even though she got her into the mess in the first
place.)  It was funny how the black guy said, &#8220;It looks like it
was wrong to trust her&#8221; and Cavil, ever the machine, says &#8220;No, it
was just a miscalculation.&#8221; It was really cool to see the humans
fighting alongside Centurions (you wonder how they explained the
problem to them); and it was also neat to see the old Centurions
on the colony. I&#8217;m still not sure how they&#8217;ll be able to fully
resolve the story. In my mind, they need (a) rescue Hera, (b)
destroy the Cylon threat, (c) find a place to live, and (d)
briefly explain how future integration will occur. Right now,
they are on track to (a) and I can imagine they&#8217;ll be able to (b)
by destroying the colony, or something. But what&#8217;ll happen with
(c) and (d)&#8230; or the other un-answered questions?</p>

<p>Well, the solution they came up with was pretty awesome. I find a
little hard to believe that they could convince everyone to put
down their technology, but it is a good solution. The connection
to real history is really cool too. It was super epic how Kara
came up with the jump coordinates and how she was really an angel
or something. Part of me wishes that they would go into more
detail with Gaius&#8217; cult, God, how the 13th (Cylon) colony was
attacked, etc, but another part of me thinks that they couldn&#8217;t
do it in a non-absurd way. By the way, I found the truce from
Cavil to be very believable and I think he would have been
trustworthy. I didn&#8217;t expect Tyril to be such a punk. What an
awesome show.</p>

<p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/03/you_will_know_t.html">Bryan Caplan</a> was very upset with the finale. He finds it really
unbelievable. I agree. But I think that the conclusion was safe,
in the sense that it resolved the core conflict in a meaningful
way. A few commentators make the point that it is the only way to
connect the Colonists with our past. One person on his site says
that the whole story is like a re-telling of the Flood: God is
sick of the wickness, so He destroys almost everyone and starts
over with a group of flawed people (Adama = Noah = weak to
drink). Another comment talks about how cool it would be if the
arrived in modern times and it dealt with how crazy we would feel
about them. The same guy says that they could have crash landed
to remove their equipment, rather than voluntary losing it. Re:
Kara leads people to their doom, might mean the destruction of
technology.</p>

Boomer is. Athena seems like she&#8217;s in so much pain. I love the
little insight into Gaius&#8217; operation. There&#8217;s now only one show
left, I have no idea how they can close it up. <em>REDACTED</em> thinks they
have to back and live on New Caprica, because that&#8217;s the only
habitable place they know. Could Hera do something that will
drastically improve the situation from the Cylon Colony? What
will it be like when the Cylon Basestar is the military HQ? It&#8217;s
intense.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://feeds.joystiq.com/~r/weblogsinc/joystiq/~3/J72px2lMtpU/">Joystiq</a> - He mentions some appalling music tracks: agree. He
doesn&#8217;t like Chocobolina: I agree, but I also don&#8217;t care. He
thought it was hard: I disagree. I don&#8217;t think his review is very
deep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-2-220373.phtml">Destructoid</a> - I like the review.</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/excerpts/~3/2gL3kyCtDGw/final-fantasy-xiii%2B2-the-kotaku-review">Kotaku</a> - Also like it</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/p3cqr/final_fantasy_xiii2_edge_review/">Edge</a> - They agree it is too easy. I would say that it is mildly
satisfying to get 5 stars and that not giving any input won&#8217;t get
you that.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GamasutraNews/~3/3OZ_bZ1jOrI/Questioning_the_vision_behind_Final_Fantasy_XIII2.php">Christian Nutt in Gamasutra</a> - His main critic is that the game is
far too reactionary and lacks its own vision. I agree with
this. The story didn&#8217;t need to be told, which is why it comes out
of left field. But the engine could have been kept and given a new
vision, but I guess that would take too long?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.2d-x.com/the-final-fantasy-xiii-2-diaries-part-two/">2D-X Diaries</a> - I agree that Noel looks like Sorah and Alyssa looks
like Samus (and has ridiculous hot pants.)</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/02/27/Game--Final-Fantasy-13-2--PS3--2012--23/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 2 (PS3, 2012) - Review/Summary</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-02-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;ve beat the game and 100%&#8217;d it, I feel like I can write
a review. Overall, I feel pretty conflicted about this game. FF13
is practically perfect&#8212;there is a lot of content that is
different; it is difficult, but trains you pretty well; it has a
decent story and a really interesting universe; it has really fun
mechanics; etc. The complaints I have with it are quite minor&#8212;a
bunch of UI things, the cruelty of the Treasure Hunter trophy.</p>

<p>FF13-2 takes that foundation and basically finds a way to fix
every little problem&#8212;the UI is much better in ways you wouldn&#8217;t
have thought could be possible (Paradigm Deck saving, Paradigm
focuses, streamlined Crystarium, Clock Master, etc); the trophies
are pretty reasonable (except Clock Stopper and Saddle Sore, but
those are just tedious, not painful like Treasure Hunter). And
then on top of that, it adds all sorts of other things that are
really fun &amp; diverse: the Monster capture system, Chocobo racing
(very minor, but fun that it is there), the Hidden Object game (a
big part of the game, a nice distraction), the extra endings,
Wounding, the Moogle clock, the Temporal Rift puzzles, etc. Lots
of little things that make the game a bit more enjoyable and
diverse. These basically mean to me that FF13-2 has better
&#8220;mechanics&#8221;, much better, in fact.</p>

<p>There are bigger things too. For example, I feel like in this game
the story and characters are more important and developed, because
there are fewer of them, you already know their basics, etc;
whereas in FF13-1 the &#8220;drive&#8221; of the
characters&#8212;escape&#8212;consumes all story bandwidth.</p>

<p>But, that said, there is a lot that was present in FF13-1 that is
missing from 2. For example, there are very few beautiful
pre-rendered cut-scenes; there number of different environments in
much less than that of 13, which is surprising to me given that
they didn&#8217;t even re-use every environment and there didn&#8217;t seem to
be very much from the &#8220;whole game of content&#8221; that was cut
from 13.</p>

<p>However, the biggest problem to me was the lack of a
challenge. During the game, I never grinded. Even in the post game,
the most you could say I grinded was at Serendipity (not in combat)
and when trying to find every creature, I had to fight a lot to get
what I wanted to appear. In addition, I don&#8217;t think I used my
resources (i.e. monster upgrades) very effectively and I never got
better versions of weapons, accessories, or used anything other
than optimize accessories for damage. Yet despite this, there were
almost no incredibly strenuous fights. I can think of less than
half a dozen that I died on and most of those I didn&#8217;t feel like I
needed to learn very much to get by.</p>

<p>This was especially true and bad of the monsters in
dungeons. Something I loved about FF13 was that normal enemies were
very hard and could kill you pretty bad if you didn&#8217;t pay
attention. In 13-2, it felt like because the game was so
non-linear, each area was too easy. That was very
disappointing. Now what is even worse than all that, was that the
bonus content&#8212;the super hard bosses, like FF13&#8217;s missions, were
weak sauce and lacking in number. Even the Long Gui, the feared
destroyer from 13-1, I beat on the first try and not at full
strength or even with a good monster ally.</p>

<p>In addition to that, of the games 160 fragments, it seemed like
only 25-ish were boss battle-related, compared to 13&#8217;s 64 boss
battle missions. Most of the fragments were pretty bland fetch
quests. That was really disappointing.</p>

<p>Ramping the difficulty up alone would drastically improve this game
and its replayability. Creating more boss encounters would be
really good too. I can forgive it for the lack of areas and
cut-scenes, because that seems really constrained by a
budget. Another improvement, IMHO, would be to have non-DLC outfits
(I had anticipated getting some, but none for Serah came out while
I was playing the game.)  and non-DLC coliseum encounters. In
particular, an FF6-style coliseum where you bet items would be a
really cool thing in a combat-focused game like this.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel really let down by the ending, if it just had a
little bit more hope&#8212;other than To Be Continued&#8212;that would&#8217;ve
made all the difference, or if there was a promise of a sequel,
etc.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played it, I will probably play it again, but
only so that I can replay the full sequence of 13. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d
play it again as often as I would 13-1. If a 13-3 came out that was
just like this, I would buy it too, but I&#8217;d hope for a bit more
improvements.</p>

<p>I think I will wait 6-ish months and then get all the DLC and come
back to the game for a bit.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, Boomer is a low down good fer nothin&#8217;. I totally predicted
that Kara&#8217;s piano playing friend was her dad and that he wasn&#8217;t
real. Given that he played that song, it makes me wonder if like
her dad was the only living &#8220;Daniel&#8221; Cylon&#8212;you know, the
artist. Because if he doesn&#8217;t enter the plot in some way, why
would they tell us about him in the first place, given that it
wasn&#8217;t really that informative about something else. (Maybe just
that Cavil is a punk.) Also, at the beginning of this episode I
was thinking about how Cavil has been missing most of the season,
at least since the hub was destroyed, and that he doesn&#8217;t really
have plans that they are getting involved in. There&#8217;s only two
episodes left!</p>

be so much better with real buttons, etc. I&#8217;ve noticed that it is
kind of cool that you can use the gun as like a force-field/shield
when things get close by tapping or by holding a shot and pointing
it at an incoming bullet. <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2012/02/26/how-to-not-suck-at-ziggurat/">This interesting review</a> has some

<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am looking for more monsters&#8230; on the Steppe. And I
finished, got all the fragments! Clock Master is hilarious with
the sound effects, etc. Running around in circles to get the
Saddle Sore achievement is funny. Fighting with Clock Master on is
ridiculous. I did like 8 fights with Don Tonberry in what seemed
like 3 minutes. I had what seemed like an incredibly long string
of Preemptive strikes for the Clock Stopper trophy, but I
failed :( Well, I&#8217;ll do something else. I am going to make my
attempt at the ending again with 5 stars. Wow. It was REALLY
easy&#8212;I think it took 6 rounds, maybe 7. I did it one stagger! I
tried to kill Caius in the final Cinematic Action, but it was the
same animation. Weird. I&#8217;m kind of annoyed that I did it with
Clock Master on, because I don&#8217;t want to see the secret ending
with the sound sped up. Maybe I&#8217;ll watch it on YouTube after if it
is fast. It&#8217;s weird, some parts of the cutscenes are fast and some
are normal speed. I like the song at the end. Serah is really
pretty in the pre-rendered cinematics and she really does look
like she could be related to Lightning. She has cat earrings. What
a depressing ending. I didn&#8217;t see any extra scene&#8230; will it
happen after the credits? Did I forget to have the Paradox Scope
on? At least the credits scroll faster. Okay it did show up after
the credits&#8230; that&#8217;s it&#8230; so lame. I tried to do Clock Stopper
in New Bodhum with the Clockwork Soldier but made a mistake. Argh!
Maybe it was a mistake to have the super speed on. I thought about
maxing out ChiChu or getting all the weapons or something, but
there&#8217;s no harder monsters to challenge, so it&#8217;s like it isn&#8217;t
even worth it. I guess I still need to beat Lightning in the
Colliseum. It is interesting that the game doesn&#8217;t acknowledge
that you did stuff like that or have other things it does
acknowledge that require stuff like that; especially given what
FF13 was like. [059:25:54 Frags 160/160 Lvl 594]</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We didn&#8217;t watch for as long as I hoped today&#8230; just one
episode. It was a really good episode though. I like the struggle
they are having about using support from the Cylons. I continue
to be fascinated by Gaius and what he is going to do. I love it
when he just says whatever Figment Six tells him to. I&#8217;m kind of
surprised what happened with Ellen. It seems even too low for
her. During this episode, I remembered something from the
Colonial Scriptures&#8230; it said that the 13th tribe was pursued by
demons. We were originally meant to assume that this was the
Cylons, but it appears that it was really not. I think it was
humans who later attacked them (as I said above.)</p>

progress from last time so I had to do a five level sequence over

worse UI than Meat Boy. For example, it is infuriating to have to
save every five levels and that it didn&#8217;t work and that you need
to press A to revive and that you can&#8217;t watch replays. Annoying!</p>

first try. (0 stars though) The Schrodinger/Proto-Behemoth fight
taught me something good about strategy. I had to switch to
Cerebus/Tri-Disaster to get him before he powered up. I got every

<div class="entry-content"><p>Collecting Fragments and Paradox endings. There&#8217;s a lot of small
comments that make me suspect Alyssa of something bad. The
missions in this game are very fetch questy, whereas in normal 13,
they are generally really tough battles. The Paradox Endings are
really cool&#8212;especially when Noel becomes a Guardian. So far
though, none of them can be the &#8220;real/good&#8221; ending. I beat Atlas
without the device! Awesome! Caius is really hard with the Paradox
Scope on. And now just got the Royal Ripeness. The Flan ending is
ridiculous! The Proto Adam ending was trivial to get. &#8220;The Future
is Hope&#8221; ending is strange because it seems like the &#8220;true&#8221;
ending, because of all the allusions to Alyssa being up to no
good&#8212;but it&#8217;s very anti-climatic&#8230; although I guess it could
setup a sequel where Serah and Snow are the heroes? It really
feels like the setup for a sequel, especially if you look at the
transcript: &#8220;A new adventure was just beginning&#8212;the hunt for the
thirteen crystals!&#8221; Fighting Caius with just Serah was really
really tough&#8230; it took about 4 times and I spent a TON of gil on
improving my Sentinel monster. Maybe it is just because of where I
am in the game, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like it has been as hard as
FF13 was throughout the whole thing. A little sad. There still
hasn&#8217;t been any explanation given of why Snow is a l&#8217;Cie. The
fragments from the Augusta Tower&#8211;The A.Z Files&#8212;reveal that
Alyssa sees Caius in her dreams and maybe is really dead? I just
read a little bit of a guide to let me know some of the things
that can be done in the game still. [050:43:10 Frags 157/160 Lvl

<div class="entry-content"><p>This episode had a major plot dump. It was very interesting and
pretty consistent. I think my favourite part was how Helen
described how John set the Five up so that they would have &#8220;front
row seats&#8221; to his plans. It was also interesting to speculate on
the meaning of &#8220;this has all happened before&#8221;&#8212;particularly
given the implication that the 13th Tribe were Cylons and there
was a war on Kobol between AIs and Humans. They still haven&#8217;t
explained who destroyed Earth when the Cylons were living
there. I speculate that it was a group of humans from Kobol who
had been searching for the Cylons for revenge and didn&#8217;t go with
the 12 Colonies. I&#8217;m also fascinated by the idea that Galactica
is falling apart and will be improved by Cylons technology. And
I&#8217;m fascinated that Lee will reform the government. I can&#8217;t
believe that the show can keep getting better and going in
different directions.</p>

greatly enjoy it. The little poems in the first half are so cute

recognize its necessity for the tragedy of the first two Acts to be

casually Juliet talks about having sex with Romeo that night to
seal their marriage.</p>

(probably the third week?) and finished on 2012/02/21. I had read
it before, when I was in college. I read more than half of the book
in the last three days of reading.</p>

<p>My favourite aspects of the book are how ridiculous Collins is, how
noble Darcy is at the end, and how struck Elizabeth is at the
realization of her past error.</p>

<p>I agree that basically nothing happens in the book, in terms of
&#8220;action&#8221;, but where it really excels is in creating a world and a
set of characters that you feel like you truly know well. That&#8217;s
what I like most about it&#8230; you feel like you are there and they
are real.</p>

<p>I find it so strange how preoccupied everyone is with everyone
else&#8217;s income and how public it is. I don&#8217;t think we can every
really understand what it was like to be in the gentry during that
era.</p>

Gaius seemed to recognize the importance of his religious role. I
hope this will be a sign that he will take it more seriously, and
perhaps that it will signify the next plot arc in the show. It
was also interesting that Tory seemed to be in charge of the
Cylons, presumably because she is one of the Five, so they
respect her, and she embraces her Cylon nature. It is also
interesting that Tyrell basically saved the fleet. I hope that
Laura realizes it is basically her fault that this happened
because she refused her responsibilities as President. I was also
reminded in this episode that nothing really ever came of the
mutiny on the Demetrius. Strange.</p>

<p>I knew it! The 13th tribe were totally Cylons! I wonder if Kara

and Earth Cylons who are part of the 12 Cylons&#8230; like they were
the ones who started the Colonial Cylon society but were a
relatively small part of the rest of the Cylons there. And
perhaps the 5 who left the 7 abandoned the original plan and went
to live with the humans casually. I think something like could
explain how Kara and Ellen could both be Cylon-like.</p>

very frustrating in that world that there are fragments that seem

the game changes&#8230; like beating it once or maybe finding another
fragment somewhere else. I don&#8217;t like the aimless direction. The
Cactuars in the platforming area look A LOT like swastikas. The
lack of explanation for Sazh&#8217;s appearance is pretty funny. Hope&#8217;s
willy nilly time traveling is pretty weird too. The love story
aspect I anticipated was very pronounced. Fighting Caius on the
beach was really tough and after I was about to get him twice,
since he came back the first time, I had just used a Phoenix Blood
and lost it :( Three Bahamuts at once! WOAH! I beat each of the
supports twice but then Jet used Gigaflare and I couldn&#8217;t get up
Sentinals fast enough :( This last battle is ridiculous, because I
just barely get him staggered and then another Bahamut comes back
and I can&#8217;t make use of it. I beat him with 17:50 (the target time
was 11:13) &#8211; bummer. I used three Phoenix Bloods and two Elixirs
(I think). Yikes. I never understood why the humans can&#8217;t just
live on Pulse. And what a stupid name for the new card: Bunivelze?
I just noticed that Serah&#8217;s earrings are little cats. Woah! Did
she just die? Wow, what a super depressing ending&#8230; Lightning on
the goddess Etro&#8217;s throne looked wicked cool though. &#8220;To Be

understand what the Paradox Scope will do&#8230; should I use it all
the time? Should I try to do the fragments I can on my own and
then use it? Do I need to reset everything? I think I will try to
do what I can without it and then start using it and closing each

Lee becoming president was incredibly predictable. I can&#8217;t

she was shacking with him; I hope she was using him for some
reason. The episode from the Cylon perspective was cool. I loved
Gaius talking to the Centurian. I still think it was horribly
wrong to destroy the resurrection hub. The revelation of who the
Four were, etc was really cool; especially how quickly Tory was
able to get over to the ship without people realizing. Getting to
Earth was super epic&#8230; having it be destroyed was also super
epic. As we were seeing Earth, <em>REDACTED</em> was like &#8220;What could they do
now?&#8221; Well, now we know.</p>

at least the creators/creations of them or something like that.</p>

far missions where you have to travel to the

bit. Something I&#8217;m not liking a ton about the game is that the
non-linearity makes it so the monsters are really weak where I am
exploring because I&#8217;ve been so far and am now coming back and
forth. Just got a 5 star on Gorgya after three tries. I like the
alternate view when you have lots of stuff open, but prefer the
normal one in the beginning. Tracking down the passwords was
tough, but strange because when I went to YM 110 AF, I was right
in front of the guy I needed to find! I wonder how I can get onto
the plateau in YM&#8230; the hover doesn&#8217;t seem to do it. Resolving
the Bresha plot line was interesting&#8230; Mog is so funny in his

<div class="entry-content"><p>This sequence of three episodes was really intense. The mutiny
aboard the Demetrius, Gaius&#8217; monotheism, the alliance with the
Cylons, it is all incredibly fascinating. Each episode is ending
of a severe cliff-hanger, particularly the third one in this
sequence, because they jump away. Crazy.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe Athena killed the Rebel Leader.</p>

<p>Although I was impressed by the Rebel Leader&#8217;s speech to the
Quorum, I think it is wrong for the humans to take away their
resurrection ability. It is just as bad as what the Cylons did to
the humans. They need to be bigger and try to promote peace.</p>

supremacy of Cylons (and the One True God, because of Gaius.)
Lee&#8217;s character continues to be exemplary. I&#8217;m extremely

miracle going on when Figment Six was picking him up after he was
beat down. The thing with Caprica Six and the Colonel was super

her son? And then Tori (sp?) killed her? I get the impression
that she has really embraced her Cylon side and thinks the humans

fact that there is kind of a &#8220;hidden object&#8221; game inside this game

dream world at the end is like the Experience Machine&#8212;would you
live the rest of your life in a perfect lie?  The battle with
Caius was intense, I felt like I was supposed to die, but didn&#8217;t;
he was really susceptible to Wound. The story of Caius&#8217; life is
very interesting. This game feels backwards from 13-1, because in
that you have a lot of freedom at the end, but this feels like I
am at the end, but I&#8217;ve been pushed into one path. It was rad to
see what happen to Lightning. They&#8217;ve firmly established that
Caius is a totally bad guy (although he does hope that Yeul will
be saved.) I just beat OMEGA in 25 minutes!!! But for some reason
I didn&#8217;t win him as a monster? I tried Lightning &amp; Amodar but got
creamed. At the end of tonight&#8217;s stretch, I see that it was a
pre-ending funnel rather than an actual ending funnel. I get the
impression if I just go forward a little bit I&#8217;ll be put into the

about her task&#8230; from meeting Lightning to saving the future. It
is getting hard to keep track of what episode I am in. I think I
found the Casino (mini games!) and a place that will lead to
Lightning at the end of the game. Some of these assets are clearly
re-used, because they are places from FF13, but they look so
different, I don&#8217;t see how this is any cheaper to make than a new
game. The Moogle Toss system is funny. It has just hit me that the
Preemptive Strike bonus is a lot weaker in this game: just about
half staggered and Haste. I got to Serendipity for the first
time&#8230; Chocobo races!!! The Proto fal&#8217;Cie in Academia are
crazy. The Academia part is really annoying because you are
overwhelmed with monsters, but they don&#8217;t give any gil or CP. I
just noticed you can get 6 digits of HP. I intend to go to the
fragment reward place every day. I decided to keep track of my
levels differently, by adding them up because I won&#8217;t go past 60
for a while. That also means that I won&#8217;t need to keep two
numbers, since they will be the same. I made a mistake when I
expanded Serah&#8217;s Crystarium. I maxed out my two main roles and
should have gotten another role, but instead expanded my
accessories. Oh well. It is so tempting to not read about some of
the mechanical details&#8230; like how many levels you can get
(presumably 99 in each?) what the fragment skills are,

redo it (which was pretty fast) and the Yaschaf one. Suck!
Actually I guess not, because I can do the Open Gate
button. Weird. Seeing Oerba was really weird, because I recognized
it so much. In fact, you can see little bits of areas from the
first game throughout. It&#8217;s pretty cool. Especially seeing the
robots you repaired. Meeting Yeul and Caius for the first time was
pretty cool. What they say makes me think that there is something
bad that they have avoided in the past, because this is the
future. My guess is that the Paddreans saw a certain future that
led them to do something good (for Yeul, Caius, their culture) and
if you change the future they won&#8217;t do that good thing and you&#8217;ll
drastically change what they did&#8212;probably related to some people
being in love. The level system is very misleading since you only
see the highest number. [008:16:03 (48/48) (12/160)]</p>

time anomalies are cute little puzzles. My strategy is to have
Serah be primarily Ravager and Noel primarily Commando. Their

N/4. All the monsters are at level N/4 as well. I don&#8217;t know if
this is a very good strategy. I am slightly worried that it won&#8217;t
be possible to max out every level, but then I realized that the
level on the status screen is just the maximum level of any

<div class="entry-content"><p>The opening is really interesting. It makes you feel like
Lightning is in some never-ending fight with this guy and there&#8217;s
nothing that can be done about it.  I like that basically no
explanation is given of why Serah is wearing different
clothes. Just because :) The Moogle clock system is pretty
neat. The graphical style is a tiny bit different&#8230; a little
darker or with more contrast. There are little things to give more
control&#8230; like jumping. The Crystarium is a lot more streamlined!
The tuning paradigm system seems like it could be neat. Historia
Crux looks really cool and gives you a taste of what you&#8217;ll get to
explore later. You win gil in fights!!! The monster system seems
really complicated. I&#8217;m glad you can have multiple missions at
once. So much in this game is an amazing solution to a small
problem in FF13. It is a little bit unclear how the gates will
work. I think I need to unlock one and then I can always use it. I
can&#8217;t tell if I am expected to unlock every gate before moving to
the next area or if certain areas are subdivided. The voice acting
seems worse because I think there is a lot more of it. [002:47:03

presented as the bad guy, but he&#8217;s so right most of the time. It

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode about space racism. That plot
line was kind of cool, but I was hoping that there would be more
to the brief appearance we saw of Caprica Six.</p>

<p>On the subject of space racism, I think it is strange how whole
planets are casually stereotyped in the show. This is very common
thing in science fiction, but it really doesn&#8217;t make sense. Given
how diverse opinions and culture are on our planet, it seems
strange to expect it to be any different. The only thing BSG has
on its side is that the planet were originally colonized by
(presumably) culturally homogenous &#8220;tribes&#8221; and thus could have
maintained their distinct (and cohesive) identities; although
that seems like a stretch given the length of time the colonies
existed.</p>

<p>Before this episode, I was thinking about the show and how
sketchy their information about the past, and in particular,
Kobol, is. It doesn&#8217;t make sense that if their ancestors could
travel through space, they also wouldn&#8217;t keep detailed records
that would give much more information. It&#8217;s inconsistent.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior 3 over the past week and a half.</p>

<p>My opinions on this game are very similar to DW1 and DW2. This
much more mechanically strong that DW2 but not as much of a leap
as DW2 was over DW1. I enjoyed the class changing system.</p>

<p>I used anti-grinding Game Genie codes to limit the amount I had to
do it&#8212;one gave me more XP and the other more GP. The combat
system gets pretty old, especially with random monsters. Fighting
the bosses is typically really fun.</p>

<p>I also played with a guide, so I didn&#8217;t have to figure out where I
needed to go myself, but I got the impression that it was much
less obscure than DW2, but not as clear as even a SNES-era game.</p>

<p>For these two reasons, I definitely didn&#8217;t get a true DW3
experience, although I&#8217;m willing to bet that I wouldn&#8217;t want that
experience. Instead, I just enjoyed the story.</p>

<p>The connection to the other games is easily the coolest part of
this and really comes out of nowhere, but makes complete sense
after the fact. I thought it was also really cool how you run into
your father right at the end. It&#8217;s really neat.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the first truly played DW game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>There were so many fascinating things in this episode. Anyone who
has seen it would agree. The things that are most interesting to
me are that they&#8217;ve consolidated the characters all back on
Galactica&#8212;Gaius, Caprica Six, Hera, etc. And it&#8217;s very
surprising that they&#8217;ve totally killed off a Cylon model. It
seems a bit too transparent of a way to remove an actress. I have
a hard time believing the Cylons would really do it. Although I
suppose it&#8217;s imaginable that in the longer run one model who take
control of all the others and make itself the only active one.</p>

<p>I think we are meant to think that Starbuck is one of the final
five or something because she&#8217;s been greatly wronged by the
Cylons and apparently has had this vision. I&#8217;m disappointed that
Gaius didn&#8217;t seem to learn anything from being in the temple.</p>

Adama&#8217;s past. Also, it was very intriguing to see the few events
on the Cylon ship; they are clearly building up to something more
important. It&#8217;s strange that Gaius is such a player and the two
Cylons girls are all up in him.</p>

they don&#8217;t believe Gaius, but also neat that he is turning more
towards the figment of Number Six than the original Number
Six. Athena&#8217;s speech reminded me of Karl G. Maeser.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really fascinating episode. I love learning about the
Cylons. The idea of projection, the taboo about the other five
Cylons, the idea of the hybrids, it is all very fascinating. It
is also incredible to imagine how the 13th tribe could have left
a booby trap for the Cylons. I hope that they go into that,
rather than just leaving it to be forgotten. I can&#8217;t tell why
Gaius didn&#8217;t share this information&#8230; he doesn&#8217;t seem to be
using it against them in any way. The drama on Galactica was
neat, but drastically overshadowed by this other stuff.</p>

would be more exciting if you were any good, but it was very basic
but not the &#8220;simple control but complex depth&#8221; that defines so
many great NES games. I don&#8217;t think I play it again. I think if it
was a bit faster and maybe with more fluid/intuitive controls it
could be really awesome.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The first Mega Man game I think I owned and played a lot was Mega
Man 2. But I remember trying to play Mega Man 1 quite a few times,
I don&#8217;t know if I bought it or if I rented it from
Blockbuster. Regardless, I wasn&#8217;t very good at it and can&#8217;t really
ever remember getting to Wily&#8217;s Castle at all. I think the biggest
problem was the lack of continues or passwords.</p>

<p>Today that 20 year battle was finished and I played through all of
Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how good this game is. I had always kind of thought
that the sequel was drastically better. It definitely has lots of
improvements, but this game is definitely amazing too.</p>

<p>I used an Infinite Lives Game Genie code so I didn&#8217;t have to
Continue, etc. The spacing of checkpoints is pretty wide in this
game though, so it was nowhere near a walk in the park.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very proud of myself for defeating some of the really
difficult segments. For example, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NDK1tIaNwU&amp;feature=related][beginning of Guts Man&#8217;s
stage]]; the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ8cTlCMiE4&amp;amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s">disappearing blocks section of Ice Man&#8217;s stage</a>; and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahAKcUX5PW0">Yellow Devil</a>.</p>

<p>This game makes you feel like a super hero. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>

turning enemies into bubbles so you can ride them and/or attack
other characters is very clever and would work in almost any other
platformer I think.</p>

<p>The first two nights I played three worlds and then the others

at a specific world as a form of password. I also used an infinite
lives password so I didn&#8217;t have to repeat levels, but had to get
through every level as-is. I did not skip any levels.</p>

<p>This is a really amazing game. Although SMB2 defined SMB for me,
when I played SMB3 it really expanded what was possible. Truly a
masterpiece. It makes my thumb hurt from holding down the run
button though. :)</p>

<p>After dinner, I played through the rest of the game. Wily&#8217;s Castle
was insane. The hardest parts were the Wily Fortress 4 and Yellow
Devil. I did Yellow Devil sooo many times and I didn&#8217;t use the
Thunder Beam or the pause trick. I have to admit that used the pause
trick on the final four robot masters and Wily.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in Japan, I bought a copy of Akumajou Densetsu for the
Famicom. I knew that it did not work on my PowerPak and I had
heard that due to its special chip the game was much much better
in the Japanese version. I got it very cheap too, so it was a nice
buy.</p>

<p>This is a great game. I find it much much more playable than the
other two NES Castlevania games. It is still quite clunky, but not
terribly obtuse compared to those games. I gave it a
play-through.</p>

<p>The first night I got the first level with a great deal of
frustration as I got used to the controls. The next night I went
through the clock tower and got Grant &#8220;DaNasty&#8221;. The next night I
escaped from the clock tower, went through the next level, and
went through the pirate ship. The day I went through 4 and 5 and
then at night I went through 6, 7, and I got to the end of 8.</p>

<p>I played through stage 8 so many times I could get through it
perfectly without getting hit at all&#8212;up until the boss that
is. I could beat the first form of Death about a fifth of the
time, but I wasn&#8217;t able to beat the second form. I probably fought
him about 30 or 40 times that night with no luck. So I decided to
use a password and skip to the next level.</p>

<p>However, in the next level I could barely even make it to the
second block. It got to the point where the screen is just
swarming with enemies that slowly suck your life away&#8230; and you
need to make it through 3 blocks and then fight
bosses. Insanity. It&#8217;s too much for me and it&#8217;s not rewarding
enough.</p>

<p>I do like the game and I will definitely play parts of it again,
but it got to an insane point that wasn&#8217;t fun&#8230; just unfair.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a great conclusion. The exodus was incredibly epic and
they did a good job preserving a lot of what was really great
from the space era of the show&#8230; like just having one ship, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really that surprised that Starbuck&#8217;s baby was a
fake&#8230; the facts just didn&#8217;t add up. And in particular, at the
very beginning of the episode I thought to myself that she
couldn&#8217;t be a half-Cylon because otherwise the Cylons would be
much less excited about Hera.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad that Gaius is okay&#8230; I presume he will be living with
the Cylons and Hera. I wonder what will happen to him.</p>

<p>Tigh&#8217;s situation was pretty rough too. Too bad, but Helen was
very untrustworthy.</p>

<p>What an awesome show.</p>

episode. I&#8217;m very curious about what&#8217;s going on with the babies
and all that. I really have no confidence with if the rescue will
succeed. If it doesn&#8217;t, then what is going to happen to the
fleet, just die? If it does, then they&#8217;re back to what the show
was before without much exploration of what could have been
really interesting. It seems strange to end the New Caprica
sequence so quickly.</p>

<p>One thing I wondered during this episode was&#8230; what were the
Cylons originally for? Were they war robots? Did they do
everything&#8230; like normal jobs? What were the circumstances of
the original rebellion. Very curious.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a really cool episode. In broad strokes, I was correct
about what the setup of the new show is. I was very happy with
the special touches that I would have never thought of. The most
exciting, probably being what is going on with Starbuck. But
overall, it was awesome. I can totally see this show remaining
amazing.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to see the show as an allegory about the
US relation to the Muslim world. Religious conflict. Overwhelming
force. Chasing down rebels. Trying to force our help on them even
if they don&#8217;t want it. Etc. I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t all work out, but
the first episode of this show with the hero being a suicide
bomber is pretty obvious point in that direction.</p>

maybe the most important thing was the off-hand comment that the

episode, there was more important, but it wasn&#8217;t obvious at the

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was an insane episode. They very quickly changed so many
fundamental things about the show.</p>

<p>The return of the survivors from Caprica was so quick, it seemed
far too easy and they didn&#8217;t even dwell on how many people made
it, etc.</p>

<p>The draw down of the Cylons was amazing, but they didn&#8217;t even
dwell on it and get the opinion of some of the people in the show
who would say something interesting&#8212;like Gaius or Figment
Number Six.</p>

<p>I was very proud of Lt. Gaida for turning in the XO and the
President and also proud of Adama for convincing her to step
down.</p>

<p>It was very powerful to see his reaction to the death of Pegasus
Number Six, as well as think about her feelings. Was she just
suicidal? Was it part of a plan?</p>

<p>The time leap to New Caprica City was also fascinating. I love
the idea of the military going back to the same waiting
anticipation that they were in so many years before, with
skeletal crews, etc. They do a good job showing how each person
had gotten sloppy in various ways or just otherwise changed their
lives.</p>

<p>Gaius becoming totally decadent seems perfectly in character. I
get the impression that he never saw Figment Six anymore.</p>

<p>Now, the bombshell at the end of the episode with the Cylons
coming back. That tops the cake of insanity.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder what the show could possibly become, because
it will be so different. Although I&#8217;ll probably be wrong, I&#8217;ll
give a prediction:</p>

<p>The Cylons came back because Caprica Six and Galactica Sharon
love their human partners and genuinely want to help repair the
damage they did to the humans by helping the relocate back to the
colonies and/or build up New Caprica. They know that they won&#8217;t
be trusted, so they&#8217;ll have to use the threat of force to get
them to help. Gaius will believe in this and fully cooperate, but
will be hated by the humans for this, despite greatly improving
their lives with Cylon workers. He&#8217;ll be seen as even more in
their pocket by having bodyguards, etc.</p>

<p>At the same time, Starbuck will lead a resistance either in the
city or in the wilderness, while the fleet attacks from the
air. The former President will create a shadow government that
coordinates these activities and does ultimately self-destructive
actions.</p>

<p>Eventually word of the Cylon baby will escape, or Gaius will lead
some sort of large scale survey to track it down, if the Cylons
don&#8217;t already have that plan. The baby will represent the further
dream of combining the two cultures peacefully.</p>

<p>This will go on for some time and then maybe some people will
leave for Earth again.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was a truly amazing episode. I love learning more about the
Cylons and particularly about what Caprica Six (what I called her
too) and Galactica Sharon are up to. Although, I was expecting
them to run off with the human, now I realize it will be cooler
for them to work inside. I&#8217;m surprised that Gaius doesn&#8217;t know
about what happened to the baby&#8230; I hope he will find out as
well as the actual mother. I think it is cool because they are
kind of setting it up so that Gaius and the Cylons on Caprica are
kind of the moral center of the show, since they effectively want
peace. When Gaius showed up to Number Six, <em>REDACTED</em> and I were like
&#8220;Whaaaaat?&#8221; as if he was a Cylon, but I think that him being in
her brain is actually more crazy. I guess we&#8217;re to think it is
God?</p>

very non-intuitive and as I got a few innings in to the first game

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the first three or four areas of The Guardian
Legend.</p>

<p>I was very interested in this game because of its shooter and
Metroid-vania mixed gameplay. But it was a little bit of a let
down.</p>

<p>The shooter parts were pretty mediocre in my mind, but I think
they were probably pretty standard and reasonable for NES shooters
of the era. The main problem with it was that it felt totally
disconnected from the rest of the game. I was hoping that it would
be integrated more.</p>

<p>The exploration was fun seemed to really matter and be
meaningful. I would quibble that I think the map presentation
could have been better, but I can look at it as a product of its
time.</p>

<p>The action was basically the same as the walking areas in Blaster
Master. Almost a Zelda perspective but projectile based. It wasn&#8217;t
very appealing to me. I can recognize that it was solid, but it
didn&#8217;t have the special something that capture my attention.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s not a game I plan on going back to, but it wasn&#8217;t a
waste of time to try out for a while.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After a night of bad eggs, I went with the reliable Super Mario
Bros. 2 (US).</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. This feels like the essential Mario game
to me. I played the first three games so much when I was a kid,
but this one just seemed so magical. The number of secrets
(locations of mushroom, warps, cute tricks to get through levels)
is just humongous. The variety in the levels and your
options&#8212;choosing different characters&#8212;is really spectacular
to. It was really awesome to play through the whole game without
using warps so I could see the whole thing. (Actually, I used the
ice level warp.)</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe this wasn&#8217;t originally a Mario game and wasn&#8217;t
even directed by Miyamoto but is so amazing.</p>

<p>I also use Peach by the way, she&#8217;s the best.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going through classic games in roughly chronological order and
next up was R.C. Pro-AM Racing. This is another example of a game
that I played a lot of because we had it and I needed to make the
most of what we had, even though I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I ever liked the game, but if I did I must have
been crazy. This game has probably the worst, most
counter-intuitive controls of any game I&#8217;ve played in a while. The
controls are basically first-person, but you see the course from a
top-down perspective. It is incredibly bizarre. I just can&#8217;t deal
with it.</p>

<p>The game is super fast though, I appreciate that.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to play through Final Fantasy 13 again in preparation
for Final Fantasy 13-2&#8217;s release.</p>

<p>I started on 2011/11/26 and finished on 2012/01/09 and played it
basically every day. I intended to just critical path the story
and not do any side quests or grinding of any kind. I kept that up
until the final boss area. It took 23 hours (23:15) to get to Gran
Pulse, about 12 hours (34:40) to get through Pulse and then 3
hours (38:45) to get to the final area. At that point I decided
that I would get all the achievements, so I grinded for 30 hours
(64:30), then did side quests for about 9 hours (73:45), then
grinded a bit more (77:57), then beat the game (79:56), and then
finished the remaining side quests and trophies (88:54). It was
interesting that this was the same amount of time as the last time
I played through and didn&#8217;t get everything.</p>

<p>Playing through the second time really solidified for me how
awesome this game is. It does an amazing job at making the combat
section action-packed and skill based. I remember being totally
destroyed by a few bosses the first time through the game; and
this time even though I was less powerful after I was beat once, I
could re-orient my strategy based on a better understanding of the
mechanics and conquer it.</p>

<p>I still think there are some improvements that could be made. I
noticed that the voice acting throughout Pulse is much worse than
the rest of the voice acting. I was bugged by how important
position was in combat, even though you can&#8217;t really influence
it. I was also re-convinced that the game is way too stingy on
money and experience.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, it was amazing and it definitely enters the FF
canon for me. I look forward to the next one with great
anticipation.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played a bunch of Double Dragon the other day.</p>

<p>This was a really memorable game for me when I was young. However,
playing through a bunch of it recently really made it seem pretty
lame. I pretty much steam-rolled the game up through the end of
Mission 3, but then I was stopped by the hordes of knife
enemies. There was really any special about the game and its pace
was too glacial for my taste.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/10/Game--Clash-at-Demonhead--NES--1989--0/">Game: Clash at Demonhead (NES, 1989)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2012-01-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2012</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played Clash at Demonhead for about an hour last night.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting action platforming game. In my mind,
that genre is defined by Mega Man and Metroid if the combat is
projectile based. The thing that is particularly interesting about
it is that it uses a Metroidvania like structure where you have a
large world that you can repeatedly explore and go through. Unlike
Metroid where the gameplay is &#8220;uniform&#8221;, Clash has different modes
where you choose paths on the world map and then do a platform
level. Almost like Mega Man where you choose bosses that are
otherwise disconnected.</p>

<p>As I said, I played for about an hour and in that time, I didn&#8217;t
really catch the vision of the open world. Instead it just felt
really confusing and mish-mashed together. It makes me wonder if I
would feel Metroid was the same way if I played it totally
fresh.</p>

<p>Additionally, the action is good but not as good as Metroid or
Mega Man. So I&#8217;ve decided to put it down for a while and maybe I
will play it again so I can give it a better chance.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting episode. It was mainly about Lee and his
psyche. I&#8217;m not sure I really understand what he was supposed to
be feeling; perhaps that his life isn&#8217;t really fulfilling because
he doesn&#8217;t have anyone to share it with. I thought the market
stuff was interesting, although I disagree with their
presentation of it as a necessary evil, because trade is mutually
beneficial. The main problem is that by the government making it
illegal, they let criminals thrive because there is no court
system to enforce their contracts. It&#8217;s the same thing with drugs
in the USA. Unfortunate.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I thought this was a really cool episode. It was neat to have the
new Sharon do interesting things and have the people make up, but
the best part was definitely inside the Tomb of Athena. I love
the idea that the symbols of our constellations were already
symbols for the ancient humans and it was a great surprise that
when the 13th tribe found Earth they saw them. What a cool idea.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The most important thing in this episode to me was that Adama
finally got his act together and decided to do what was
right. Other than that, the best thing was learning a little bit
more about the myths and scriptures of the humans. I hope that we
eventually learn more about the Kobol society and why people left
in the first place, etc. It&#8217;s very fascinating&#8212;especially given
how much the Cylons seem to care about the human myths.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In the fleet, I thought it was crazy that Adama didn&#8217;t
immediately apologize for Tigh&#8217;s behavior and fix it. I would
have expected him to have disagreed more fundamentally with
him. His conversation about Boomer was also interesting. They are
doing a really interesting job trying to present the Cylons as
somewhat sympathetic characters&#8230; at least the Sharons. The
President&#8217;s actions were fascinating as well, especially her
reluctant (but required) offering of blessings.</p>

<p>On Caprica, the concept of the Farm was horrific. I&#8217;m glad that
Starbuck is getting back. I thought it was neat that we&#8217;ve met a
new Cylon. Now it will be a big &#8220;dun-dun-daaa&#8221; moment when we see
another copy of him on the fleet and the people there won&#8217;t know
what we do.</p>

involving the Chief and the President.</p>

<p>I thought the Chief acted very wisely in trying to help out the
two girls, but also that he was noble in his obedience to
&#8220;soldier ethics&#8221; in regards to the Doctor&#8217;s disagreement with the
Lt. I find the command structure of the military to be
fascinating&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to be involved in it, but it&#8217;s
great.</p>

<p>The President&#8217;s little speech and revelation was pretty epic and
tough.</p>

<p>The XO is such a punk. I wonder how Adama will clean up his mess
once he wakes up. Tension.</p>

stuff going on, this one opens with almost every bad thing
imaginable all happening at the same time. Some of the bad things
seem a bit too contrived&#8230; like Starbuck losing the raider. But
overall it created a lot of tension that the rest of the season
can resolve.</p>

<p>I like the further development of the backstory for some of the
characters.</p>

<p>I was really struck by how the marine wanted to pray and he
called the president the Gods&#8217; prophet.</p>

<p>I was very annoyed that Lee didn&#8217;t immediately go investigate the
fallen Cylon ship, although maybe the next episode will open with
him doing exactly that.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Super Meat Boy when it first came out (November 2010) and
I played the majority of the first world right when it came out,
but it took until about January 2011 until I started playing it
regularly&#8212;every two days&#8212;and I haven&#8217;t stopped.&nbsp;I
finished the main game&#8230; i.e. got to the ending sequence&#8230; on
September 30th, but I&#8217;ve been going through the bonus levels and
the Dark World since then. <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/114/SMB_COMMENTARY_VIDEO_/#b">Here&#8217;s a video commentary</a> of the whole
normal game.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant game. It&#8217;s amazing how perfect the controls
are and how perfect the game just feels in general. There are very
very few ugly things about the game. The biggest annoyance for me
is that the replays are weird when you interact with things like
buttons on the level, because the effects you have on the world
aren&#8217;t reflected in the replay. If that&#8217;s the biggest problem with
the game, then it has no problems really.</p>

<p>Every level is a little exercise in gaining really tight muscle
memory and solving a little bit of a &#8220;puzzle&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a
puzzle like a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle in the sense that
there is a specific way you have to traverse a level. For example,
using barriers to block the laser eye in a certain sequence,
etc. In essence, you aren&#8217;t logically solving a puzzle as much as
you are gaining an intuitive understanding of some challenge and
then integrating it into your dexterous control of the Meat Boy. A
particularly memorable level is a boss fight where you race
another character. It&#8217;s very neat and you don&#8217;t need to have it
explained that you are racing, it&#8217;s so obvious when you start.</p>

<p>The game is very hard and demanding, but it also very fair and
very very satisfying when you conquer a level. I thought it was
not as hard as N+&#8230; a game I really loved&#8230; on average, but
definitely on par and with some levels that are N+ hard or
harder. In particular, the ending levels are really really hard.</p>

<p>Something strange about the difficulty is that I would often have
more trouble at the beginning of a level than at the end. It
almost felt like the first part of a level was a new challenge,
whereas the last part of the level was just putting you through
some motions you&#8217;d done before.</p>

<p>I intend to 100% complete this game and do everything that is
possible on the XBLA release. It&#8217;s an amazing game and definitely
goes in my canon.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/27/Game--Gran-Turismo-5--PS3--2010--2/">Game: Gran Turismo 5 (PS3, 2010) (3)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-27T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Gran Turismo 5 for Christmas for my dad and I. I&#8217;d never
really been super into a racing game before, although I played a
racing game for the SNES and I got a diddly wheel for the PS1 to
play Ridge Racer with. I remember going over Sean&#8217;s house and
seeing his brother play Gran Turismo 1, but it&#8217;s always been in my
periphery since then. I&#8217;d been hearing a lot about how awesome the
game was and how demanding it was of your skill, so I decided to
make it a new hobby. Due to the flood, it took until some time in
January to start playing regularly. After getting started with the
controller I decided that I needed a racing wheel and a stand for
it. That was a really good idea, because it made the game so much
more awesome.</p>

<p>From January to September, I played the game every day. For the
first two-ish months I would play for about an hour or so, but
after that I would just do one race/event per night. After
September, I&#8217;ve been playing every two-ish days. After getting up
to the Extreme series in Spec A, I switched to closing out all the
Spec B races. In each case, I would not proceed until I got a gold
on every event (although I delayed a pre-Extreme event because it
was very very difficult.) After closing out the Spec B, I went
back and finished the other Extreme events. My statistics right
now are:</p>

<p>A-Spec Level: 28
B-Spec Level: 40
Game Progress: 95 %
Current Credits: 13,585,072
Total Wins: 303
No. of Cars Owned: 135
Trophies Earned: 50 %
Total Distance Driven: 42,292.1 Miles
Licenses: S (Gold: 25; Silver: 8; Bronze: 27)</p>

<p>Right now, I only have one Spec A event in Extreme left&#8230; the
Formula GT races (which are incredibly difficult) and all the Spec
A Endurance races. Plus I&#8217;d like to go back and get gold in every
License test and I haven&#8217;t done many Special Events.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m at the point where every task left in the game
(i.e. the 5% of the game that remains) is excruciatingly difficult
and often very time consuming. For example, each Formula GT race
takes about 30 minutes and you need to do six of them to win the
event. You can save the game in between races, but you can&#8217;t
tackle the courses piecemeal. The Endurance races were incredibly
tedious even on Spec B (which is AI controlled)&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine
how horrible they would be in Spec A.</p>

<p>Given how much time I&#8217;ve played the game&#8230; obviously it is
amazing. I wish there were more of the average difficulty races,
because I&#8217;m now at the depressing stage of playing the game more
and more. Basically, I wish I could play the game for ever and
keep making incremental progress, whereas right now I feel like I
need to jump a really big wall.</p>

<p>Overall, my favourite thing about the game was the nice difficulty
curve that made you always feel like you were improving and the
general skill that I feel like I&#8217;ve acquired because of it. It&#8217;s
almost like a shmup in a sense, because you have to gain personal
skill to do well. There were some awesome moments at the beginning
of the game when I was shaving milliseconds of trial times to get
a gold trophy. It was very satisfying to do. Sometimes though it
feels like you just need to get a better car to even have a chance
at certain races and it is hard to tell when that is. I think the
UI could be improved to give you some indication that your car is
very weak relative to the competition. Eventually I started using
a guide to recommend which cars to get&#8230; because there are so
many it is hard to decide what to buy at any one time.</p>

<p>The graphics and sound are amazing, as expected. The
side-of-the-road textures are really bad when you are going slow
(because you are terrible) but at the right speed they are
great. I had a little bit of screen tearing, but I get the feeling
it was something with my TV rather than the game. My favourite
tracks were the forest tracks where you got to see the interplay
of shadows and light. Very beautiful.</p>

<p>When I was doing Spec B at the end, I found the RPG side of the
game&#8230; getting credits and cars and upgrades to be strangely
satisfying. I can&#8217;t reiterate enough how absurd the Endurance
races are. There are 9, 12, 24 hour, etc races. It is
ridiculous. I would leave the game on over night or all day to
just finish them once I knew I had a strong enough driver, car,
and pit-strategy to just win with no effort. I wish there were a
&#8220;Simulate until the end of the race&#8221; button. The worst was
grinding the XP to get to the final race. I was a little annoyed
that nothing happened when I beat every single Spec B race.</p>

<p>I will continue playing the game. The main question is whether I
keep pushing at the remaining 5% or if I select the part of the
game that I like and keep doing it over and over. Probably a
balance of the two. However, I don&#8217;t think it would be possible
for me to actually play the whole game from the start again. Maybe
if they had some way of locking you out of certain driving assists
to have a different &#8220;difficulty&#8221; level, I would consider it. But
Gran Turismo 6&#8230;. probably :)</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played through the Battlefield 3 campaign.</p>

<p>A friend of mine lent me the game because he had played through it
and enjoyed it.</p>

<p>A little background before I discussed the game. I played through
all the original id FPS games: Wolf, Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2,
and then Quake 3. I got really into deathmatch around Quake 2 time
and played very competitively. The only console FPS games I have
ever played were Modern Warfare 1 and this. I basically had a 10
year gap of playing FPS games and have never played one on the
computer since then.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed about this game was that the language
was very poor in attempt to be realistic, although they seem to
almost exclusively use the F swear word. This is most prominent in
the very beginning of the game when you are with a group of
people.</p>

<p>The graphics are quite good, although nothing really
spectacular. In some places, there are really bad glitches. For
example when you a driving a tank quickly there are fields of
shrubs popping into existence in front of you as you drive. The
degree to which they go to duplicate film is almost
embarrassing. There are many fake film grains and &#8220;dust in the
air&#8221; effects. One character model looks exactly like the voice
actor (who is a relatively famous actor). Why not just be a movie
if you really want to be a movie? While playing the game, the most
impressive thing is the lighting.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed quickly about the game is how slow it
is. You feel like you are crawling all the time or that there is a
run button that you can&#8217;t find and thus are in stealth mode or
something. This sluggishness extends to the aiming controls as
well. I found that the sensitively just increased the size of the
&#8220;jumps&#8221; rather than their frequency. This is definitely a place
where old games were vastly superior. I assume the change is to
support the inferior console controls and/or inferior mass player
population.</p>

<p>I assumed that it would be fun to be part of a squad and run
around with other dudes. But most of the time you are just
following one guy (with a giant &#8220;Follow&#8221; marker on his head) and
then you get somewhere and they give you something important to
do. (Inexplicably you are the best at everything, yet need to
always be told exactly what to do.) An annoying necessity to give
the player something exciting to do.</p>

<p>The squad mechanics are related to my least favourite thing about
the game: you feel like you never accomplished anything. There
were many times where I was with my squad trying to advance or
defend some position and there seem to be an infinite number of
attackers (both at that instant and because more would come) but
then I kill one guy and suddenly all the opponents are suddenly
dead and it is time to move forward. I feel like the abstraction
inside the game is that X enemies must be killed before you can
advance or one from each of the 12 positions, which otherwise
refill shortly. It&#8217;s very strange and gives you the impression
that you are randomly shooting until the roller coaster moves on.</p>

<p>The shooting itself is very infantile. The aim assist system is so
strong that it seems like you can just alternately tap the left
and right shoulder buttons to bring up the sights&#8230; auto
aim&#8230; shoot&#8230; do it again. It is easily the most effective way
to play and it has basically no skill, yet it is also visually
jarring and makes me a little dizzy.</p>

<p>Dodging is just as easy because you don&#8217;t need to. It&#8217;s like an
action movie where every enemy always misses and the hero never
misses. You feel like there are always bullets flying but they
never hit you unless you are totally out in the open (i.e. not in
the right place&#8230; behind the guy you are following.) If you ever
do get hit, just duck for a few seconds and go back.</p>

<p>Since you don&#8217;t have to really plan where to go (follow the guy),
or what to shoot (everything), or try very hard to shoot (auto
aim), or dodge, you rarely feel like you have any impact on
the game or any real challenge. It&#8217;s just like a ride.</p>

<p>Roller coaster ride is normally a good thing to describe something
as, but in this case it has one of the bad aspects of a roller
coaster. You have no idea where you are going and don&#8217;t feel like
you have control over it. There is literally never any reason to
go backwards or on a different path.</p>

<p>The only times I ever died was before I learned to always follow
the guy, during cutscenes (more below), and when I didn&#8217;t realize
it wasn&#8217;t time to advance (related to not following the guy.) I
never felt like any death was due to lack of skill, but was due to
the game&#8217;s weird rules. (For example, you kill all the guys you
can see in front of you, but you haven&#8217;t killed enough on the
other side, so when you get beyond them you instantly die from
advancing to far or everyone inexplicably turns to you because now
they can see you&#8230;. and you&#8217;re the player.)</p>

<p>The ride has little breaks where you pilot vehicles. These seemed
like a preview for the multiplayer, because they weren&#8217;t very fun
or challenging, but they were just a little break. The best part
was actually the pre-flight checks on the jet mission. Not because
it was particularly fun, but because it felt really realistic and
cute. I was kind of surprised at how boring the flying was. The
tank drive was just frustrating because it controlled so poorly. I
guess that&#8217;s realistic. =)</p>

<p>Easily the worst thing about the game were the quick-time events
and the pseudo-cutscene where you need to do something. The QTEs
are so dumb because you have a split second to make a button
press, but there&#8217;s no reason why that should be the button you
have to press and it is up so far. Basically this means that you
have to die three or four times and memorize the button sequence
at do it. This would not be so horrific it didn&#8217;t take so long to
get back to where you were before. At the last QTE, the whole
sequence maybe took 40 seconds, but every time you died, it would
take about 160 seconds to reload. It was excruciating. Another
occasion was like that because you weren&#8217;t really in a normal
cutscene, but control was taken away from you, but then suddenly
you need to shoot&#8230; but the rules of shooting were broken because
you can&#8217;t aim. The first time I did I died because I tried to aim
and then shoot rather than just shoot. Argh.</p>

<p>The way they deal with failure in the game is really weird. If you
get shot at and died, you fall down dead. That&#8217;s great. If you do
something incorrectly, like you don&#8217;t get to the vehicle fast
enough, the game screen just turns black and you do it again. They
don&#8217;t depict the consequence in any way. It&#8217;s very weird and
jarring.</p>

<p>The height of the game for me was the sniper mission, because it
felt very cool and had great graphics.</p>

<p>The story of the game was fine. It was like a Tom Clancy book, but
with this strange interrogation/flash-back/flash-forward motif. I
thought it was really neat that you played the end first and then
went back, and the second time you did it, it seemed to be
harder&#8230; i.e. not actually harder, but with more enemies. Some
story segments were very meh. For instance, the HALO jump that the
soliders do is so lame compared to Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>

<p>A few tiny annoyances: You can&#8217;t pause cutscenes and when I tried
I accidentally skipped on. They give you hints to do things even
if you are already doing them&#8230; like crouching, so you think you
must not really be crouching, so you stand up, and then you
die. Thanks game.</p>

<p>The game didn&#8217;t give me any play statistics, but I started at
7:15pm (that was the earliest achievement at least, so it must
have been a bit before that) and the last achievement was at
1:38am, but I took a break to have a big snack, talk to the wife,
get ready for bed, etc. I&#8217;d reckon the game took about 5 hours.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/25/Game--Contra--NES--1988--0/">Game: Contra (NES, 1988)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-25T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>25</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I played Contra on the Famicom.</p>

<p>I played for about an hour and got to the end of the third stage
reliably, but couldn&#8217;t take care of the boss fast enough. I played
the Japanese version so I could use stage select and start from
the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the
game. This effectively gives you infinite continues if you are
honest about not going past the point that you&#8217;ve gotten before. I
like infinite continue systems, provided the time in between
continue points is sufficient large. I feel like a lot of newer
games have such tiny checkpoint stretches that you can just plow
through. I realized that the reason I want to 1CC shmups is
because when you continue you start from exactly where you were
rather than the beginning of the level, so it feels really cheap
to do so.</p>

<p>After deciding to put it down for the day, I decided to play the
US version and use an infinite lives Game Genie code so I could
quickly play through the whole game and remember what all the
stages were like. (Since you begin a new life exactly where you
were, this allows you to plow through any problem.) It was nice to
remember what everything was like. The noises during the snow
stage were very memorable, as were the sounds of blowing up the
spiked walls in the factory.</p>

<p>This game is very tight and has a lot of friction, which is really
good, especially compared to some of the games that haven&#8217;t stood
up very well. It&#8217;s a solid game, but I think it has a few
problems. The major one is that it so wedded to the wrong arcade
sensibilities&#8230; namely cheap kills to get more
quarters. Nevertheless, this is definitely an optimal path through
most levels. For example, after a dozen or so tries, I could get
through the third stage without getting hit once. (Of course, the
boss trounced me.) I remember this game being great to play with a
friend, although in retrospect it has some bad co-op attributes:
you can kill your friend by scrolling the screen and you can too
easily steal their upgrade. Given these, I&#8217;m not sure I really
would want to play it with someone, because I wouldn&#8217;t want to
make them mad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m not sure I would play the game again or invest the
time to get past stage 3 honestly. The main reason is that it just
isn&#8217;t a joy to play. It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s not the giddy kind of fun
that a Mega Man 2 or Bayonetta is. It just isn&#8217;t the
Ur-Run-n-Gun.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/24/Game--Blaster-Master--NES--1988--0/">Game: Blaster Master (NES, 1988)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-24T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>24</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blaster Master tonight after getting home from
Thanksgiving in SLC.</p>

<p>I had fond memories of reading about this game in Nintendo Power
and seeing the box art many many times. However, I don&#8217;t remember
ever playing it. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve always thought of it as a game I
played, but when I stretch, I realize I can&#8217;t remember any
details. Another funny thing happened related to this game
recently. Just last night a student asked me if I knew the name of
the game with the kid and his frog that jumps in a
hole. Naturally, I said &#8220;Blaster Master!&#8221; And then I played it the
next day.</p>

<p>The game was very fun. The platforming is very simple. It&#8217;s more
of a combat game. However, the combat is not really twitchy or
skillful. It is more a matter of being patient and taking each
enemy one at a time. I thought that I would appreciate the
&#8220;Metroid&#8221;-ness about it. But, although there is a back-tracking
and an open world. The upgrades you get feel like &#8220;keys&#8221; that are
only used once, rather than enhancements of your abilities that
you use all the time. That&#8217;s a weak way to have a system like
this. Perhaps the worst part is that the final upgrade makes the
jumping feel totally off, wrong, and hard to do right because you
accidentally go under the platform you are on. The bosses are
really really hard and in most cases I resorted to dirty tricks to
get them&#8230; like going into a place where I could hit them but
they couldn&#8217;t hit me. Some it was pure luck.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do stick by the game being fun, and although I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, I would recommend it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played Bionic Commando for the NES today. I remember playing
this game a lot as kid, but rarely getting past the sewer stage (I
distinctly remember getting caught by the blobby things over and
over again.) It was very fun and straight-forward once you got the
&#8220;hang&#8221; of it.</p>

<p>The grappling mechanics are really solid and the game in general
is pretty solid. Something I didn&#8217;t remember was that it really
isn&#8217;t much of a combat game, it is primarily a platforming
game. There&#8217;s basically no reason to fight most enemies and even
the final battle is really a platforming challenge.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that this will go on the same &#8220;Play it again&#8221; list as
Mega Man 2, but it is a solid game that I want to play again
eventually to remember how solid it is.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday and today I played through The Adventures of Lolo. I
have fond memories of it when I was younger, although I don&#8217;t
remember ever beating the game.</p>

<p>I had a pretty reasonable time, although I used a walkthrough for
two hints. On one level (the third to last), I had to be reminded
that I could push eggs into the water, so once I saw that line in
the level guide, I went right through it. On the last level I
thought I had was at the end of my wits because the only thing I
could come up with didn&#8217;t work. The walkthrough told me to do
exactly what I was doing, except I needed to run faster.</p>

<p>I quite like the style of the game, although I slightly prefer not
having the action element where you can&#8217;t think about each move
and need to have speed. Although it is not a humongous issue in
any of the levels.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I have very found memories of playing Kid Icarus a lot and
associate it with Metroid in my mind as one of those great NES
games with a system that modern games have kind of forgot. I
played it again recently and was utterly destroyed by it. The
cruelty of the games defies description: there is basically no way
to restore health during one of the long levels (except the
fortresses) and when you move from one level to another, you keep
however much health you had during the last one without bringing
it up to full, so you can get irreparably in the hole. Plus,
you need to grind to increase your maximum possible life. I got to
the first fortress and was destroyed. When I remember back to
being young and playing this, I seem to recall using a password to
get to the end a lot, so I tried that it was fun to play that
again, but I really wish I could play through the game proper.</p>

<p>Playing through that portion made me realize that it really isn&#8217;t
anything like Metroid. In a sense, Metroid takes a run-n-gun
platformer (like Contra) and combines it with a Zelda-like item
upgrade and open world structure. In contrast, Kid Icarus
takes a run-n-gun platformer (like Contra) and adds just two
aspects of RPGs: item stores and grinding. Not the best things to
add, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I will play it again, but I&#8217;ll move on to the next game for
now. I&#8217;ve realized that what I want to do is take a first pass at
all the older games that I remember or have heard so much about
and figure out which ones I really do want to invest some time
in. If the game is appealing enough, then I&#8217;ll play through it
right then, otherwise I&#8217;ll mark it down in my list to continue
with later. This game definitely makes the cut for the &#8220;play in
the future&#8221; list.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through the original Final Fantasy yesterday and
today.</p>

<p>Like Dragon Warrior, I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t have the patience to
play through it at the original grinding rate, especially because
the two battle systems are so primitive. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t
find a power-leveling code for FF. I feel a little dirty admitting
this, but I just used a code that immediately won every battle and
turned off random battles.</p>

<p>This means that I basically just experienced the story and the
structure of the game. The game is a series of giant fetch quests,
very similar to Dragon Quest 2, but it feels a little bit more
open than DQ2. Already in the first game, the story is very wild
in breaking the fantasy cliches. Definitely when the game starts,
it seems just like Dragon Quest&#8230; some random medieval
world. But, pretty soon you have robots, time travel, and other
things like that.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the refresher on how the series started. I can&#8217;t comment
on what it would be like to truly play it again though. Maybe I
will with the PSP version.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago I played Milon&#8217;s Secret Castle for a night. I had
heard about Chad Concelmo talking about playing it when he was a
kid and I watched Arino on Game Center CX beat it. It seemed
pretty interesting. I looked at a strategy guide that showed a
flow-chart for what you had to do in the game&#8230; which is
otherwise really opaque.</p>

<p>The mechanics were pretty responsive, but I didn&#8217;t love them
unconditionally. I would have probably loved this game as a kid,
because it would be my only game and I&#8217;d have to figure out the
order of things to do myself. But now, I find it annoying because
I don&#8217;t totally love the mechanics and I can&#8217;t save in between
play sessions, so I&#8217;d have to repeat everything each
time. Nevertheless, I got up to the third or fourth boss before
deciding I&#8217;d seen enough.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior 2 yesterday and today. Again, I
used codes to improve experience and gold acquisition. The gold
one was too effective, so I could get whatever I wanted
easily. The experience one was better, because it required me to
grind a tiny bit. At the very end, I used another code that
disabled random battles to go directly to the final 6 bosses
without getting in fights along the way.</p>

<p>This is a major jump in the sophistication of the series. There
are multiple characters, a ship, multiple enemies in battles, a
wide array of spells, and a much more expansive quest. It is
interesting that it was developed at the same time as Final
Fantasy, which had many similar advances over Dragon Quest 1.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable game and much better to play for
modern players. However, there are a lot of insane secrets that I
would have given up in frustration trying to find if not for the
walkthrough I used. I doubt I will play it again, but I&#8217;m glad I
played it.</p>

<p>Final stats: 31/29/23; used two codes: easy xp, easy money, and
then at the end, no random battles</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoy some of the later Castlevania games, so I wanted to
play the older ones. I remember reading about them in Nintendo
Power a lot and I thought that I would really like Simon&#8217;s
Quest. I distinctly remember adoring the pictures of all the
different kinds of whips you could get.</p>

<p>In my play, I got to stage 6 (I think there are 18) in the first
game and only the first dungeon in the second game. I found the
first game to be mechanically better, but I thought that both were
way too sticky and had many frustrating things, like not being
able to change direction in mid-air and the hit-boxes not being
visually accurate.</p>

<p>I quit the first game because there was no password system and I
didn&#8217;t love it enough, like a shmup, to master getting through the
early stages to get back to where I was before.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I quit the second game because the first dungeon had invisible
holes in the floor that had no tells whatsoever. (The first
instance of this in the game had a good tell&#8230; a monster who
stops at the end of a platform would stop early.) This requires
pure memorization and is deeply insulting to the player, in my
opinion. If I were younger and this was my only game, I would make
a map to record them or just suffer through it, but I quickly
said: Not worth it!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not very good. I think the main problem I have with it is
that hit box detection is terrible. You can have your foot in the
enemy&#8217;s skull and it doesn&#8217;t register a hit. The diagonal jumping
control is also really off.</p>

<p>But, I can see how the principles of this game have gone on to
more developed games, and I appreciated it for that.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Dragon Warrior for the NES tonight. I played
through the whole game straight, and I used a Game Genie code to
low the amount of grinding time required. (It just gave me a
EXP/Gold boost.) I remember playing and beating this game a lot
when I was a kid, because we got with the Nintendo Power
promotion.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it then and it was fine now, although it is very
simple. I think Guadia Quest from Retro Game Challenge is a better
retro JRPG. But nevertheless, it was good to play through and
remember the experience.</p>

<p>However, other than number 9, I&#8217;ve never really played other games
in the series. I intend to go through them as I play through game
history over the next few months/years.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/11/10/Game--Eternal-Sonata--X360--2007--0/">Game: Eternal Sonata (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-11-10T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>10</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Eternal Sonata on the Xbox from October 17th to
last night. I remember downloading the PS3 demo when I was sick
one day when the <em>REDACTED</em> was very very young. It seemed pretty cool,
and I like Tri- games, so I&#8217;ve had on my list since then. I saw a
Craigslist posting about it and grabbed it for ten bucks. I
finished the game with 23:59:46 on the game clock and my A-team
was around level 53 (significantly lower than a FAQ I glanced at
recommended) and the other characters on the bench were around the
low 40s.</p>

<p>The story and setting of this game is really bizarre. It takes
place inside the mind of Chopin, the composer, on his death bed
and is about a group of people kinda fighting the big bad empire,
but at the end it takes an even more bizarre turn and loses all
comprehensibility. But it doesn&#8217;t really matter. The end was even
worse for me because I used Japanese language with English
subtitles during the game and the ending had no subtitles. (Really
weird actually.) I don&#8217;t regret it though because the few times I
heard the English voices was horrific.</p>

<p>The graphics are beautiful and cartoony. There are many tiny
details in the background which really give flair to the world. In
a word, the graphics are &#8220;lush&#8221;&#8230; in colour, in detail, in
scope&#8230; it&#8217;s great. However it is incredibly unrealistic, unlike
say FF13 which is fantastic in a realistic way. One thing strange
about the art is how the characters look mostly like action
figures, but then there is uncanny shading on a nose, or under
eyes, or on cleavage, or even on the edge of their hair. I think
the worst part of most characters is how &#8220;stuck on&#8221; their hair
looks. In particular, Allegretto looks like a bald man wearing a
wig.</p>

<p>When I started I assumed that the music would have been amazing,
but it was just good. Nothing really special about it, but
definitely serviceable and a solid &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now, let me comment on the mechanics.</p>

<p>It has a really weak meta-game, outside the combat. There is very
little constraint on your resources. Well, if you rely on battles
to give you money, you&#8217;ll be struggling. However, Beat can take
pictures and sell even bad pictures for about 10k, where the best
weapons and items cost far less than even 3k. Since you can store
12 photos, this means that every time you visit a shop you can get
over 100k. This basically means you have infinite money. The real
constraint on your resources is that you always need to back-track
(the game is a straight line) to get to a shop, so you need to
make sure you stock up beforehand.</p>

<p>Other parts of the meta-game are a little annoying. For example,
you have an incredibly large party and balancing their levels
becomes very frustrating and I gave up around 15 hours in and just
stuck with one group. The exploration of dungeons can be very
annoying too. One of the prices of the lushness is that almost
every area of a big dungeon looks identical and every one is
either a literal maze or puzzle. These are fine in moderation, but
this game does it too much and rewards the exploration too
little. (There are very useful items in chests, for example.)</p>

<p>The largest part of the game is the battle system.</p>

<p>They do a good job unfolding the battle system with the Party
Level system that advances at fixed story parts and gives you new
challenges and options. In a nutshell, it works like this: each
character has their own turn that lasts a fixed amount of time,
they have some amount of Tactical Time before their clock ticks,
and movement/attacks take certain amounts of time. Time is
essentially your MP-like resource that controls what you
do. Special attacks are divided into dark and light categories
which you can only join when you are in light or dark
areas. Enemies are affect by the light too. It&#8217;s a neat little
thing. As your party level goes up, some of these get more
complicated. For example, at the beginning tactical time is
infinite and at the end it is zero. At the end, the speed of your
characters just goes up a lot so you can get things done faster. I
would said it is almost too fast at the end&#8230; I accidentally ran
past enemies a lot.</p>

<p>Overall, the battle system was satisfying, but it has a lot of
flaws. First, there are things that are too cumbersome to actually
use, like switching special attack sets in battle. I&#8217;m amazed they
didn&#8217;t bind that to the triggers. Second, the layout of the
characters, enemies, and arena are few in number in each area of
the game&#8230; on the order of two or three. This means once you
discover how to beat that enemy configuration, you can do the
exact same thing again. It gets old and makes you want to just run
past the enemies so you don&#8217;t have to fight them. Third, there is
a single strategy that works for all random encounters and one
that is almost the same that works for all bosses. For normal
enemies, just do lots of little combos and take them out one by
one. For bosses, build up Harmony Chains (big combos) with two
characters and have the other one on healing duty. This makes lots
of fights incredibly rote and frankly a little
boring. Nevertheless, each session of playing had a significant
section where I enjoyed the smashing of buttons and increasing of
numbers.</p>

<p>I actually fell asleep during this game more than once. One time I
was even in battle and fell asleep briefly, then woke up and
survived the battle with the one character that wasn&#8217;t dead yet. I
think in that case it says more about me than the game.</p>

<p>I thought about quitting the game a few times, but ultimately
decided to continue. I&#8217;d say it was worth it, but would have been
better if the game were shorter (or just better, of course.) I
doubt I will play this again. And so, I can&#8217;t recommend it very
highly, despite being a reasonable game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m beginning to really like Starbuck&#8217;s personality and I like
the interrogation of the Cylon, because they are very interesting
characters. This was the first time I realized that it is a bit
unreasonable to only show Cylons we know of working together
(when they are by themselves) simply as a conceit to the fact
that viewers shouldn&#8217;t know who the other ones are. The trope of
a &#8220;shadowy council&#8221; probably won&#8217;t be as bad as this. I think it
is very interesting to speculate on the psyche and goals of the
Cylons, particularly with their psychological warfare like shown
in this episode. I was very intrigued by what would happen when
Gaius found out that Sharon was a Cylon&#8230; will he tell Adama
right away?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I liked how this episode made reference to the long and detailed
history of the pre-Cylon attack life, including major political
figures. Also, I enjoyed the principled attitude of Apollo. The
situation with Gaius is getting very complicated.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This episode was interesting, but it was the first &#8220;normal&#8221;
episode for me, rather than one that really blew me away. I
thought it was neat to imagine how Sharon didn&#8217;t even realize she
was a Cylon and could actually fight against it. It was also cool
to learn more about the logistics of the Fleet. I like that
seemingly trivial things like that can be the &#8220;enemy&#8221; in this
show. I&#8217;m also very curious where the stuff on Caprica will
go. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it can possibly be relevant because Karl
can&#8217;t ever get to where the Galactica is.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I really like how tragic this show is. My favourite form of drama
is tragedy and I think one of the reasons is that I like it when
circumstances go as low as imaginable, but then people persevere
and are heroic. This episode had that in spades. I almost cried
at a few parts. I really enjoyed the joy at the new baby at the
end. The idea of the whiteboard where every human is tracked is
brilliant.</p>

<p>One thing I wonder about the world of the show is whether there
was a time when the Twelve Colonies did not know about each
other. Did they have a pre-radio technology era, or were they
colonized with advanced space technology and mostly stayed at
that complexity for a long time?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I liked a lot of things about this episode.</p>

<p>I really like the concept of Number Six being a character. The
awkwardness of Gaius being the only one who can see her is very
fun.</p>

<p>I think the Cylon&#8217;s perspective is fascinating. I liked listening
to the guy on the depot talk about how they were serving God by
punishing the Humans for their sins. I thought it was awesome at
the end of the episode how they said they had to find and kill
the Humans or else they would come back some day for revenge.</p>

<p>I thought the revelations about the Human religion and the idea
of the mythic Earth is really cool. It makes you feel like they
could be out there somewhere. The <em>REDACTED</em> connection is great
too. I loved what they said the first verse of the Sacred Scrolls
were: &#8220;Life here came from out there&#8221;. They know they are
colonists of somewhere, but don&#8217;t know where.</p>

<p>It is a fascinating world. I think that&#8217;s what I like about it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We watched the first episode of Battlestar Galactica last
night. Actually the first part of the miniseries.</p>

<p>My favourite part was how clearly they communicated that most
people had no idea what the Cylons were like and have no fear of
them, but that the old guys who do are the best qualified to deal
with them. I really liked the realization, as the war started,
that almost all the soldiers were too young to have even ever
seen a Cylon, but were now responsible to deal with them.</p>

<p>Very cool so far, I&#8217;m excited about the show.</p>

<time datetime="2011-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Zelda II: The Adventure of Link over a few
nights. The first night I got familiar with the game and leveled a
bit. The next night I beat the first palace and explored up to the
second palace. I didn&#8217;t play for a while and then I played again
tonight. I played through to the sixth palace and got to the
boss. I died in my first fight with the boss and decided to put
the game down for the night. However, when I reset the cart so
that I could save the SRAM on my PowerPak it said that there was a
fatal error and I couldn&#8217;t backup the SRAM. When I turned it back
on, I had lost my save data.</p>

<p>I had one boss and the last dungeon between me and the end of the
game. I declare it a draw. Maybe I&#8217;ll try again some day, but it
is so debilitating to have to redo so much.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember playing this game as much as the first Zelda when
I was younger. I remember the first palace and the general style
of the game very much, but I don&#8217;t remember making a lot of
progress or being very attached to it. When I played through this
time, I thought it was fun.</p>

<p>It has a reputation for being very difficult. I thought it was
about the same difficulty, but there were some things that were
different enough to feel harder. For example, after losing all
your lives, you don&#8217;t continue at the place where you are, you go
back to the start of the whole game and it may be a long walk
back. This feels quite frustrating. Another thing is that a lot of
the enemies are cheap NES mobs that soak up a lot of damage and
seem impossible to every really connect with (the many shield
enemies are like this.) Finally, there are
Castlevania-Medusea-esque floating heads that knock you off a jump
when you are going over lava pits. Arrggh. There are some things
that seem easier, like the opportunity to level and cast spells
and that you can easily get all your health/magic back outside a
dungeon.</p>

<p>I definitely enjoyed the game and it will be on my long-run
rotation.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/10/16/Game--Resonance-of-Fate--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Resonance of Fate (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>my wife got me Resonance of Fate for the PS3 for my birthday, but I
didn&#8217;t start playing it until the beginning of August.</p>

<h1>Play details</h1>

<p>I played it pretty much every day in August, when it was my main
game, but by the end of August, I was getting a bit tired of it. I
did every thing that was possible to do in the game as I played:
all the extra missions, challenge fights, and going to the Arena
occasionally. Eventually, the grind wore down on me quite a bit. I
stopped doing the challenge fights in chapter 10 and then in
chapter 12 I decided to stop doing the extra missions. This was
after 38.5 hours of playing the game. At that point, I rushed to
the end, but when I got to chapter 14, I couldn&#8217;t get past the
first room of the story mission dungeon. I realized I wouldn&#8217;t be
able to do, so I went back to my chapter 12 save and just played
for a very short time (about 1 battle or 1 mission) every day. It
took me until yesterday to get to the last dungeon and I decided
to push on through to the end of the game.</p>

<p>In the end, I played for 54 hours. Vashyron was level 76
(30+28+18), Zephyr was level 86 (27+35+24), and Leanne was level 3
(32+27+24). I definitely will not do all the Arena ranks or play
through the secret Neverland dungeon.</p>

<h1>Story</h1>

<p>I found the story of the game to be really intriguing. The world
is very different than most games and I like the way that there
isn&#8217;t a lot of exposition in the game. Instead, you are just
normal-ish people in the world and things gradually unfold. Most
cut-scenes are less than two minutes long it seems. Some cut
scenes are hilarious and some are really fascinating and
cool. However, after you get to level 10 or so and you realize
that the game must almost be over, it is really weird that it
seems like nothing really happened. It&#8217;s just mild character
development. Even when the game was over, I said to myself, &#8220;What
even happened in this game?&#8221; I read the Wikipedia page about the
game and then all the dots connected. The story in the game is
intriguing and vague; the story in the Wikipedia page is
fascinating&#8230; I just wish it were in the game.</p>

<h1>Style</h1>

<p>The characters and world exude &#8220;style&#8221;. I love the dress-up
mini-game and I bought lots of different clothes until I found an
outfit for each character I really liked. I dressed Leanne with
black glasses, a black tight sweater, a pink knee-length skirt,
and tall white boots with a big bow on the laces so they looked
like  knee-ish high socks. I dressed Vash in jeans and a cool
white Resonance of Fate jacket. I dressed Zephyr in a dark
green-ish suit with a red undershirt.</p>

<p>The style really comes to a head in the battle system. It feels
exactly like a John Woo movie.</p>

<p>The Christmas segment&#8230; including the costumes&#8230; is insane.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe tri-Ace&#8230; which I think of as a very small
company&#8230; could make such a beautiful game.</p>

<h1>Mechanics</h1>

<p>The most important part of a game to me is its mechanics. In RoF,
there are a few systems.</p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s the world map. It is basically a board game where
you are unlocking pieces of the world with Tetris-like jigsaw
pieces you get from battles. You can only go places you unlock and
by unlocking places you gain other rewards such as items or
effects in battle. It is neat and totally unnecessary (for the
rest of the game to work), but I enjoy it, so it is a welcome
addition.</p>

<p>Second, there&#8217;s the gun customization and item synthesize
systems. The game&#8217;s combat is gun-based and you can customize your
guns with additional parts like barrels, scopes, magazines,
etc. There are like 5 attributes that you can enhance. I have no
idea what these attributes actually do, despite having played
through the whole game and spent a lot of time customizing. The
system works by laying out the extra parts in a 2D grid where they
must connect in appropriate ways (empty circle attaches to full
circle, empty square to full square, etc) to each other and
ultimately to the gun. It is fun to make ridiculous looking guns,
but I don&#8217;t feel I really understood it enough to do it well. The
item synthesis is a corollary to this system because you can build
parts (and accessories, grenades, and bullets) with it. I don&#8217;t
think I mastered (or needed to master) either system, but I did
use and have fun with them.</p>

<p>Third, there&#8217;s the progression system. Each character has three
levels that are summed to get their total level. There&#8217;s one level
per type of weapon&#8212;hand gun, machine gun, and thrown
weapon. Gaining levels gives you abilities when using that weapon,
like 10% damage increase, etc. I didn&#8217;t focus each
character. Instead, I constantly rotated weapons around (you gain
levels in the weapons you use) to the weak character with that
weapon to boost their total level. Gaining total levels gives you
health and weight capacity (did I mention guns, accessories, and
their parts have weights?) I wonder if it would have been better
to focus each character.</p>

<p>Fourth, and biggest, there&#8217;s the combat system. It is incredibly
complicated to explain, but very simple once you understand
it. The fundamental principle is that you can do a lot of blue
damage and very little red damage and only red damage kills
guys. However, if someone has 100 points of blue damage and you do
1 point of red damage, then the blue converts to red and you just
did 101 points of red damage. Everything in combat is about
filling up blue damage and then doing a little red
damage. However, there are many subtleties.</p>

<p>The most basic is that the angle you are firing at the enemy
matters and many enemies have shields that absorb fire from one
direction. The next is that blue damage recovers over time, so you
want to focus. The next is that you charge shots faster the closer
you are to the enemy. The next is that blue damage on you does not
turn into red damage, but instead when it fills up your whole life
gauge takes away 1 Hero point for every 1000 hit points. But
what&#8217;s a hero point?</p>

<p>In this game, you can either stand still, charge and fire once, or
you can run past an enemy (jumping through the air and sliding on
the ground) and fire many times. When you make a run, you use a
Hero Point. You need to do this to make enough attacks. If you
ever run out of Hero Points, the next time your HP fills up blue,
you&#8217;ll die, but you&#8217;ll die anyways because you can&#8217;t do these
runs. There&#8217;s another subtlety though. If you run across the line
made by the other two characters, it gives you a Resonance Point,
which you can convert to one cycle of a tri-Attack where each
character makes a Hero Run to the point where the next character
is standing. During a tri-Attack, any enemy inside the triangle
cannot move or have their blue damage healed.</p>

<p>The trick to this system is that there is only one strategy: Have
each character make a hero run across the line of the other
characters such that they go really close to the enemy and end up
on the other side. Do this twice to set up a tri-Attack with a big
triangle. Then do it again. This technique wins every single
battle. The only thing you ever need to do in addition is
sometimes use grenades to cause area damage or wear the right
status-effect protection accessory.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the game (probably the first 20 hours), this
system feels really cool and neat every time. It is definitely fun
and original. However, after a while, you realize that it is just
like Sudoku. Every Sudoku board is the same because your strategy
is always the same. What you are doing is always the same. In
contrast, even though you can describe FF13 or Bayonetta in a
reductionist way&#8212;increase stress and then do damage OR do combos
and then do torture attacks&#8212;-how you do that is different in
every situation. In RoF, it&#8217;s the same. It doesn&#8217;t exactly get
boring, but it loses its challenge.</p>

<p>The worst part, however, about the combat system is that it feels
a little too random sometimes. As mentioned before, there&#8217;s just
one strategy I used. But I still often needed to make the attempt
to beat a boss three or four times in sequence before winning. The
only thing that separated one attempt from another were random
factors like causing a break, getting pushed a little bit by fire,
or getting a full scratch, or something. It doesn&#8217;t seem right
that a random flip will make me go from utter defeat to utter
dominance. It seems like a random factor should make a small
difference, not a big one. This suggests to me that the game
really doesn&#8217;t require much skill if I could never recover from
little flips like that.</p>

<p>A related problem is that it never feels like there is anything
you can do to make your characters better or more
powerful. Gaining levels, getting gun upgrades, etc don&#8217;t seem to
make any difference on your play. I&#8217;m sure they do something but
it is so gradual they you never feel like you&#8217;ve reached a
new plateau where you can look down at where you were
and say you rock. There&#8217;s nothing technically wrong with this, but
it doesn&#8217;t give me the feeling I want.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>I was looking forward to this game because I&#8217;ve enjoyed every game
that tri-Ace has released that I&#8217;ve played. (I think I have missed
two games.) And when it was first coming out, I heard lots of fun
conversations about its crazy battle system. I wasn&#8217;t let down by
the game, but I don&#8217;t think this game will be as lasting to me as
Valkyrie Profile or Star Ocean 3 are. Overall, I recommend the
game. If you aren&#8217;t super hardcore like me, maybe it would better
to have an easy mode, but I don&#8217;t think one exists.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Bubble Bobble on the NES. It took about four
days: the first three days I did about 30 levels each and then I
did the rest and the boss on the last day. I had my wife help me for
the boss, so I could get a good 2-player ending.</p>

<p>I love this game. I remember playing it sooo many times with my
brother as a kid. It&#8217;s really great. I don&#8217;t remember some of the
levels being so hard and I don&#8217;t remember ever beating the boss,
although I get the impression that I did.</p>

<p>It felt very good to conquer this game. I highly recommend it to
everyone. I&#8217;m looking forward to playing it with the <em>REDACTED</em> and the
Peach when they are older.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Excitebike on the NES. I considered it
completed when I placed in the top three in each race.</p>

<p>I remember playing this a lot as a kid, although when I was young
I would mostly make tracks with tons and tons of jumps, rather
than actually playing the races. In fact, when I started to play
recently I didn&#8217;t even know about the two different acceleration
buttons, although I quickly figured it out and did okay.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pretty fun game, but I like modern racing games better. In
a lot of cases (i.e. sports games) I like the older, more abstract
games better, but in this case I think that it is a bit too
simplistic for my current tastes.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/09/14/Game--Metroid--NES--1986--1/">Game: Metroid (NES, 1986) (2)</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metroid over the past few days. (I started on the
10th, got the majority of the items and killed Kraid. Then the
next day I got two missile tanks and got to Ridley&#8217;s zone. Then
today I finished Ridley&#8217;s zone and finished the game.)</p>

<p>This is another game that I remember very fondly as a kid. I
remember using my dad&#8217;s maps and playing through it a lot, and
then discovering the JUSTIN BAILEY code and using it a lot too. I
don&#8217;t remember ever beating it though, or even really doing very
good or getting very far.</p>

<p>I think the problem when I was young is that I didn&#8217;t have the
patience to grind out health to refill all the tanks that I got;
whereas playing through the game this time, I spent a lot of time
doing that to be prepared for the enemies. If you are willing to
do that, the game gets a lot easier.</p>

<p>The final area with the Metroids and Mother Brain is brutal
though. Much much harder than any other part of the game. The
Metroids practically instantly kill you if they catch you. I had
to play through it quite a few times.</p>

<p>Overall, this game totally survived replaying and remains as
awesome in my mind as I&#8217;ve always thought.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/09/09/Game--Mega-Man-2--NES--1988--0/">Game: Mega Man 2 (NES, 1988)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-09-09T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Mega Man 2 for the NES. I beat two bosses on
Monday, the rest of the bosses yesterday, and Dr. Wiley&#8217;s Castle
today.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game a ton when I was a kid. But I don&#8217;t
remember ever getting to Wiley&#8217;s Castle, and especially not
through it. I&#8217;m kind of amazed that I was able to do it in such a
straight-forward way this week. I don&#8217;t normally think of myself
as a super-gamer; maybe I&#8217;m just remembering it being harder than
it was? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Something that struck me this time was how short a lot of the
levels were before the bosses. For instance, I love Bubble Man&#8217;s
music, but I hardly heard it at all because I finished so fast. In
contrast, when I was a kid, I could never get past all the death
spikes on his stage, so I got really familiar with the music.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the stages were so good, so fun. The bosses are
great. Man, this game is just a perfect little nugget. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s anything that isn&#8217;t polished just right. There are
challenges, but they can all be overcome with a little
practice.</p>

<p>This game is amazing.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played The Legend of Zelda on my AV Famicom with a RetroZone
PowerPak. It was awesome.</p>

<p>I started on Monday and played for about an hour while the <em>REDACTED</em>
was asleep. I got to the 2nd Dungeon, but got my butt kicked
pretty bad. I played yesterday and spent a lot of time in the
beginning crawling the map buying everything and finding all the
heart containers I could, then I got up to the 6th Dungeon in a
few hours. Today, I took it the rest of the way. I found the 6th
Dungeon to be very hard. I was able to complete the last dungeon
with two visits: the first one got me all the items and got me
familiar with the layout, but when I got to Ganon, I died, because
I only had 3 lives and no potions. I refilled hearts, potions, etc
and then went back and beat Ganon on my first (real) try&#8212;I only
used one potion too.</p>

<p>I tried to limit myself to the information in the Nintendo Power
archive I had, although I used Google at least once to find out
why I couldn&#8217;t shoot arrows (they consume money.)</p>

<p>It was very nostalgic to play, because I remember playing this a
lot when I was a kid (although I don&#8217;t remember ever beating it, I
do remember getting to Ganon.) My strongest memories of playing
the game are the first three dungeons. But stronger than memories
of playing it are memories of reading the manual and looking at
the map my dad made while he or my brother played. My mom says
that before I could read or play well, I would tell Joe what to do
by looking at my dad&#8217;s map.</p>

<p>I remember thinking it was really hard when I was a kid. It is
definitely difficult&#8212;much more so than modern Zelda games&#8212;but
I found it pretty straightforward to get good at. It wasn&#8217;t
crushingly hard like most people say NES games were.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I played this again. I intend to do the Second Quest
in a few months or something.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-04T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>04</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. I pre-ordered
the game and I&#8217;ve been sitting on it waiting to put down Resonance
of Fate, which I&#8217;ve been playing for about a month, but it is
grinding me down.</p>

<p>I started this game on Thursday and beat it today. It was a pretty
fast game, but very memorable.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game is a 3D action game with platforming
sequences and special 2D platforming levels. There is also a
single racing level. Every mechanical part of the game is
acceptable. The 2D platforming is very good in my opinion. The
racing sequence is better than a lot of racing sequences in games
(about as good as the racing sequence in my beloved Bayonetta.)
The 3D platforming kind of sucks, but I don&#8217;t like 3D platforming
anyway. This game makes it a bit worse than normal because of the
crazy visuals, but ultimately it&#8217;s pretty much okay. The 3D action
game doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the depth I&#8217;d like, but it does
its own thing and is successful at it.</p>

<p>The combat system is based on a Rock-Paper-Scissors system with
three different weapons that are more powerful versus another
weapon, etc. You can switch on a whim, instead you must steal a
weapon from an enemy. This creates a fun dynamic where you have to
plan out a battle in a split second by deciding which enemies to
attack in which order. It&#8217;s simple and pretty fun and the weapons
all feel different. Overall, there&#8217;s no major flaws in this part
of the game, but you wouldn&#8217;t play it just for it. It does ensure
that this really is a game and not just a long cinematic-spotted
corridor. I think my only complaint about it is that you never
feel like the avatar is getting stronger in anyway, so combat in
the beginning of the game is almost exactly like combat at the
end. However, this isn&#8217;t totally true because you as a player
advance and you can deal with more enemies, more variations,
etc.</p>

<p>Getting away from passable, interesting, but not spectacular
mechanics, this game really shines in the presentation
department. For example, there is absolutely no HUD and you don&#8217;t
need it.</p>

<p>The most appropriate word for this game is &#8220;fantastic&#8221; in the
sense of inspring awe and bafflement at the world it creates.</p>

<p>The story centers on fallen angels who have created mini-paradises
for themselves and humans on the Earth. These paradises are
unimaginable. In most games, something looks good when it
simulates reality well, or when it gives you a well realized
vision. In El Shaddai, nothing really looks like anything you&#8217;ve
seen or thought of before and doesn&#8217;t really seem like it should
either. There are sooo many crazy details. For example, as you
approach the angels&#8217; tower, there is lightly shimmering text on
the ground you&#8217;re walking on. In other times, when you are in a
particularly angelic place, it is so bright that it hurts your
eyes and looks like nothing that could ever exist on Earth. It&#8217;s
really quite amazing.</p>

<p>What is so much more amazing though is that each level of the game
looks nothing like any of the other levels. They are all
incredibly unique. Sometimes it even seems like the character
model is changing to better fit the new area. It&#8217;s very bizarre
and interesting. The futuristic/racing world was particularly
different, but each was different in a special way.</p>

<p>The story is baffling. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s because of the
ancient Jewish origin or the Japanese interpretation. Either way,
it&#8217;s baffling in a way that evokes interesting ideas and
feelings. There&#8217;s something really cool about a world where
Lucifel, the pre-fallen Lucifer, talks to God on a cell phone and
wears designer jeans.</p>

<p>When you beat the game, it clearly challenges you to play it again
on harder difficulties and perform some feats, but I don&#8217;t think
the game is mechanically appealing enough to actually do it. This
is definitely not a cine-game where you don&#8217;t feel like you did
anything, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere close to something
like Bayonetta or Ikaruga where you want to beat it on every
difficulty level and do everything it offers.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a must player.</p>

<p>Best Reader: YOU</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/16/el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-review/">JC Fletcher&#8217;s review</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair to categorize the
weirdness as part and parcel of a Japanese game; this is more like
something that arrived fully formed from another planet.&#8221; and &#8220;If
you want a game in which you battle nautilus-headed henchmen in an
underwater disco while a mute, dreadlocked fallen angel obscures
your view with his earnest dancing &#8230; your dream has been
fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played inFAMOUS last night. I&#8217;m glad I did pay for it. I got it
with the &#8220;So, sorry, Sony&#8221; program, based on hearing the Giant
Bomb people talk about them.</p>

<p>At first, when I pressed the start button, I thought it was going
to be rad because it has a really strong opening. But really
quickly I realized it was terrible.</p>

<p>The controls and avatar movement feel unbelievably bad. It feels
like you are skating across a frozen lake, but moving in a
slow-motion human-shaped tank. The voice acting is horrific. The
attack animation move glacially as well.</p>

<p>I only played for like 30 minutes, but oh man, so bad.</p>

<p>Ba-leted!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played Raiden IV a bit. I played through to the end of the game,
including the second loop. I basically credit-fed the second loop
after making it to the second loop in a legit way. My best score
was 17,036,000. (A little short of the 20mil to get the last point
achievement.)</p>

<p>One thing I really liked about the game is that there were
massive, beautiful explosions and the way the ground spins, moves,
and feels really deep. I also liked the way the final boss appears
to be The Stone-Like. The weapon selection is pretty cool. It
reminds me a lot of Blazing Lazers.</p>

<p>There were quite a few things I didn&#8217;t like, though.</p>

<p>The size of the hit-box is really unclear and seems large.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel like the enemy bullets pop out of the background and
your bullets enough.</p>

<p>The game feels like it is cheating when you try to dodge some
shots. Specifically there are many times where the field is bigger
than the screen, so when you move to the left or right you move
across the background but basically stay in the same spot. This
feels like cheating because the bullets move with
you&#8212;effectively making it like you can&#8217;t dodge.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it when snipers come on-screen and then go to the
bottom of the screen and shoot up at you. I was thinking about
other shooters and couldn&#8217;t think of situations where you have to
dodge what is behind you&#8212;except in boss segments where the
screen is fixed and you&#8217;re not scrolling anymore. This last point
doesn&#8217;t seem broken; it is a legitimate gameplay choice, but I
don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t go in my rotation, but I got $10 worth of fun.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Aug</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played it for about a week and got to Chapter 7. Each day I
played it, I completely exactly one chapter. Each chapter took
about 30 to 40 minutes of play-time, although I don&#8217;t think the
in-game clock counted deaths, which I estimate added another 15
minutes on average.</p>

<p>As I played, I took little notes. Unfortunately, almost all of
them are about bad things. But before I say the bad things, I
should say that if this game didn&#8217;t have such stiff competition,
it would probably be very good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s competition, is, of course, Bayonetta&#8212;a.k.a. pure gaming
amazingness.</p>

<p>At it&#8217;s core, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta are the same kind of
game: 3D action/brawler. Thus, it&#8217;s very fair to compare them.</p>

<p>Ninja is cut from really different cloth though. For example, in
Hideki Kamiya&#8217;s commentary of Bayonetta, he talked about how he
didn&#8217;t like blocking in action games because they were too slow
and emphasized static resistance, rather than fluid
dodging. Bayonetta&#8217;s dodging is a brilliant counter to
blocking. Ninja, however, has really static blocking, that
actually hardly ever feels effective.</p>

<p>In the same commentary, Kamiya talked about how it was important
to him that Bayonetta could not be knocked down, unless she is
killed. In addition to promoting feminist power, this ensures that
the player never has to wait for her to get up for the action to
start again.</p>

<p>There are many, many, many times in Ninja where you feel like you
are frustratedly waiting for Ryu to get up from being knocked
down, finish a &#8220;strong&#8221; attack so you can move and dodge (which,
of course, you can&#8217;t, so you get clobbered), or waiting for an
enemy that has trapped you to finish its animation. This is a very
unfulfilling and frustrating time. I found the Skull Boss in
Venice to be a particularly bad offender on this point.</p>

<p>One of the worst experiences in all dynamic games is the dreaded
turret sequence where you must stand still, shoot at things with a
different (i.e., uncomfortable) mechanic, and get knocked back
when you get hit. Even the wonderful Bayonetta has such a sequence
(although, it&#8217;s really not that bad because it&#8217;s so fast and you
basically can&#8217;t fail.)</p>

<p>Ninja does not have a proper turret sequence (at least in the part
I got to.) Instead, every time you have to use a missile weapon,
it becomes one. It is unbelievably bad and drastically slows down
the game and your ability to dodge as you painful readjust the
camera to the target.</p>

<p>On that note, in general the camera in Ninja is pretty bad. FWIW,
I think a camera is bad when you have to think about it &#8220;as a
camera&#8221; rather than becoming a natural part of your motion. I
think the reason is that the camera is too tight on Ryu. It looks
perfect when it is directly behind him, a little above his
shoulder, looking out at the stage with Ryu in the bottom middle
of the screen; but this angle/placement becomes really bad when
you are jumping around fighting. In contrast, in Bayonetta the
camera is at a much higher vantage point with Bayonetta in the
center and the stage around her; this placement is much harder to
mess up and I don&#8217;t recall it ever happening.</p>

<p>But now, these are relatively minor problems. I wouldn&#8217;t have such
high standards if not for the masterpiece, Bayonetta. So, why did
I quit Ninja Gaiden II after about 6 hours of play and completing
about half the game? Crashes.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 5. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>The game crashed in chapter 7. I gave it another chance.</p>

<p>This time it crashed again in chapter 7, at the same spot, the
very next time I tried.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that people can sell video games that crash like
this. Old games had flaws and buggy behavior, but I don&#8217;t remember
experiencing any crashes. I think that the possibility of
releasing patches has made developers sloppy and decreased the
objective quality of modern games.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to monetarily punish Team Ninja for this
infraction.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I was very curious about this game because I&#8217;m fascinated by weird
mashups of genres. This is a mix of a fighting game and shmup.</p>

<p>Playing it is almost indescribable. It looks like it should
be a dual-stick shooter, but the right stick only controls the
camera. There&#8217;s no continuous spray of bullets and doesn&#8217;t even
seem to be a normal &#8220;fire&#8221; weapon. Instead, the buttons are mapped
to special attacks, like in a fighting game, but when they are
released they are similar to the patterns a boss in a shmup might
release. Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t play for long, but I found very
difficult to control or grasp.</p>

<p>I can imagine something like this being worthwhile, and maybe this
might even have some hidden depth, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for
me. At least, not right now. I guess I&#8217;m too into the pure
versions of the these genres to appreciate the mashup.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, I bought Raiden Fighters Aces for the 360 as part of
a bundle of games from the SHMUPS forum.</p>

<p>I played it a few times.</p>

<p>It is a compilation of three old shooters in the same
series. There&#8217;s nothing really spectacular about them and they
aren&#8217;t even visually fantastic. At least they aren&#8217;t emulated
perfectly on MAME. I doubt I&#8217;ll play it many times, but I will
keep it on my list in case I get shmup-desperate.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, Chaos Rings went on sale to promote the prequel that
was released. I bought it, stupidly thinking that the reason I
hate playing games on my iPhone is that they are unfamiliar
genres. It turns out I just hate playing any game on my iPhone. I
played enough of this game to see what it would be like, but I
doubt I&#8217;ll play it again unless I&#8217;m totally desperate. I&#8217;d rather
just read something on my phone. I don&#8217;t blame this game though, I
think it&#8217;s really the fault of the phone.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Also included in the bundle was, Bullet Witch. I had heard a lot
about this game from the 198x podcast, of which I am a huge
fan. They talked a lot about the game&#8230; how much they loved it
and played it, despite generally agreeing it was kind of a bad
game.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese phrase, クソゲー, for this type of game. And
wow. It&#8217;s pretty bad. I played through the first level and found
it very hard to bear. The graphics program was poor and
distracting&#8212;objects popping in as you walked around, effects
like shadows popping in. The control was very awkward. The action
was surprisingly slow paced and unexciting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at a point in my life where it&#8217;s not worth it to read books
I&#8217;m not interested in, finish movies that I don&#8217;t love, or
dedicate a lot of time to games that aren&#8217;t rewarding enough. If I
am going to spend precious time on games, I&#8217;d like to play the
best games. In this case, if I want a third-person shooter, I&#8217;ll
play Vanquish. If I want a sexy witch-themed action game?
Bayonetta. Accept no substitutes.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I started on the July 12th and beat the main game on the 19th. I
continued playing the optional content until today. I did all the
extra &#8220;Search&#8221; missions, but I didn&#8217;t want to invest the time to
do every other mission to unlock the /Final/ mission. (So I
watched it on YouTube.) In the end, I cleared 86 missions in
36:22:53.</p>

<p>I thought the game was amazing. It&#8217;s beautiful and the controls
actually feel really nice (unlike Portable Ops, where the controls
were atrocious.) The story is really cool too. The main thing I
didn&#8217;t like about the game is how a lot of the extra content
revolved around incredibly difficult boss fights. (It was about
half that and half stealth missions&#8230; which were all really
fun.)</p>

<p>I thought the pace of unlocking new content was really nice. A big
problem with some games like this is that you feel drowned in the
number of possible options. This has a nice slow drip that feels
rewarding to unlock more. Eventually though, it became too much
for me when there were so many combat missions on the docket.</p>

<p>There were many funny in-jokes in the Metal Gear Universe that I
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the game though was the disgusting Che
worship. Ugh.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I have now played and beat every Metal Gear game that has been
released!</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Castlevania: Harmony of Despair.</p>

<p>I was really excited when the game was announced, because
Castlevania games are basically perfect in my eyes. I was also
excited that it would be multiplayer, because I wanted to have
my wife play with me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as more information about the game came out, I was
pretty disappointed. You can&#8217;t play multiplayer in the same room
and it&#8217;s just the combat sub-system of the game, with a lot of the
progression stripped out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to get it and play it.</p>

<p>I played through the whole game with Alucard. I was originally
planning on playing through with all the characters, going through
the DLC characters and levels, etc&#8230; but after playing through
once I&#8217;m kind of non-plussed about doing that. I expect that it
will be more and more of the same with very little excitement.</p>

<p>While I won&#8217;t play more of it, I did enjoy what I played. It is
very difficult to play by yourself, because there are very few
benefits to grinding and it isn&#8217;t balanced for single player, but
it is very rewarding to conquer and master the boss patterns. In
particular, Death and Dracula each took me a few weeks to
beat. When I finally beat Dracula, I could only take one more hit
and I was in that state for a few minutes&#8230; miraculously dodging
everything. It was pretty rad.</p>

<p>I started the game in April and played about twice a week, then I
switched to playing every two days about two months ago.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Space Invaders Infinity Gene every four days for
most of the year.</p>

<p>It was a very neat, unique shooting game. Rather than overloading
you with bullets, it overloads you with enemies and environmental
art. The upgrade/unlock system is interesting and there are many
clever weapons&#8212;although there are some clear winners overall.</p>

<p>My only complaint about the game is that the controls are too
sensitive, so it is hard to make fine movements AND there are many
times where it is hard to tell what parts of the background can
hurt you and which ones can&#8217;t. Nevertheless, it is a solid, fun
game.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend it, but I probably won&#8217;t schedule myself to play it
at all regularly.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played throug Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, doing
about a puzzle a day since February. Today, when I did the last
in-game puzzle, I binged and did all the extra challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It was very good Layton game. It was exactly what you would expect
structurally. The new mini-games were interesting. I thought the
moving around the different areas was a nice touch that added
variety and assisted in the story development.</p>

<p>There were a few annoying puzzles, as always, that are poorly
defined or brainless search problems, but in general it was really
fun. I found tracking down everyone to give them tea particularly
annoying, especially because you couldn&#8217;t check who you needed to
still visit.</p>

<p>All together, it took 21 hours 41 minutes. I will play the next
one.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/07/08/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid-4--PS3--2008--1/">Game: Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3, 2008) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-07-08T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 4 from the 25th to late last
night (although, I had a break from the 30th to the 6th.)</p>

<p>First, some stats about my play through. I played on Big Boss
Hard&#8212;the hardest difficulty available when you first turn it on,
but not the hardest overall. I chose this difficulty because there
was no &#8220;Game Over if Spotted&#8221; mode, so I thought by making combat
more lethal it would force more stealth. I think that worked
out.</p>

<p>After each of the five Acts, the game gives you stats, which I
wrote down:</p>

<p>Act 1:
Total Play Time: 03:48:51
Continues: 9
Alert Phases: 29
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 14
Current Drebin Points: 76,710DP</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I didn&#8217;t make any kills in this act (or, in
fact, in the entire game.) I&#8217;m proud of that. I had more alerts in
this act than any other. I think that&#8217;s attributed to getting used
to the game, rather than its difficulty.</p>

<p>Act 2:
Total Play Time: 07:52:10 (4 hours more)
Continues: 12 (3 more)
Alert Phases: 53 (24 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 28 (14 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,811DP</p>

<p>I ended with fewer Drebin points because I bought the tranquilizer
sniper rifle. I used less continues on this act. It also took
about the same amount of time time.</p>

<p>Act 3:
Total Play Time: 11:43:25 (~4 hours more)
Continues: 17 (5 more)
Alert Phases: 63 (10 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 34 (6 more)
Current Drebin Points: 66,741DP</p>

<p>I think I bought a shotgun or something.</p>

<p>Act 4:
Total Play Time: 16:10:38 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 31 (14 more)
Alert Phases: 81 (18 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 64 (30 more)
Current Drebin Points: 153,021DP</p>

<p>At this point, I stopped needing money that much. I used more
healing items in this act than any other. I think the main
offender was the unmanned vehicles that take out a whole life bar
on a melee attack.</p>

<p>Act 5:
Total Play Time: 20:53:19 (~4.5 hours more)
Continues: 46 (15 more)
Alert Phases: 89 (8 more)
Kills: 0
Recovery Items Used: 81 (17 more)
Weapon Types Procured: 37
Flashbacks Watched: 214
Special Items Used: Not Used
Current Drebin Points: 332,947DP
Code Name: &#8220;Pigeon&#8221;
Other titles: Inchworm, Hyena, Pig, Leopard</p>

<p>I used more continues in the final stage than any other.</p>

<p>One of my general comments about the game is that it is very
similar, structurally, to MGS3 where there is a tight, linear act
structure. However, MGS3 was better in a sense by making
everything feel much more connected. In exchange, however, MGS4
makes the globe-trotting incredibly epic, which is nice.</p>

<p>In the department of gameplay, I found the two trailing sequences
to be REALLY fun. There are many things in Metal Gear that make me
think you could build a whole game around one of the parts. I
thought that the fight with Vamp was very frustrating because I
couldn&#8217;t grab him well. However, after getting to that point so
many times, on my final fight, he didn&#8217;t hit me a single time. The
final battle was similar: the gameplay was so drastically
different it was very annoying to have it so difficult and
different at a crucial time, but on my last try, I didn&#8217;t get hit
at all. (Pro Tip: Trap him against a wall.)</p>

<p>In the story department, this game is a winner.</p>

<p>All the scenes with Raiden are really cool.</p>

<p>The many reveals (especially in Europe) are really cool,
especially after having played the other games so recently.</p>

<p>The scene where Liquid triumphs is hilariously well acted.</p>

<p>There are many funny throw-back jokes. For example, Otacon tells
Snake to switch discs when going into the building he had to do
that in on the PS1. Also, during the Mantis fight, there are many
funny references (especially on the codec) to past
games. Brilliant.</p>

<p>I found the story behind the beauties to be very sad, and
tragic.</p>

<p>The scene between Johnny and Meryl is great.</p>

<p>my wife&#8217;s comment: People&#8217;s butts in this game look weird.</p>

<p>In a conversation at the end, someone says that Snake will no
longer be anyone&#8217;s toy. I feel like this was a reference to him
not being in any more games.</p>

<p>The credits music is beautiful.</p>

<p>It took about 90 minutes after beating the last boss for the game
to be done. I stayed up toooo late.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Desktop Dungeons every few days for about two
months. I was able to get through the normal mode easily with the
Fighter and the advanced version of the Fighter, but I haven&#8217;t
been able to with any other classes&#8212;I&#8217;ve tried the next Fighter
and the Thief, mainly the Thief. I feel like the game&#8217;s random
creation engine is flawed and creates un-beatable dungeons. For
example, in the last one I did, I beat every enemy and was only
level 8, but the boss is always level 10 and indestructible. I&#8217;ve
decided to stop playing because of this&#8230; I gave it many chances,
but every play session is becoming too rote. Initially, I thought
it was very cool because it flet like a roguelike, but was very
bite-sized. I think the idea is still good, but needs to be
refined.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through Metal
Gear Solid: Portable Ops.</p>

<p>I really liked that this is a canonical game and features Naked
Snake. I find his character really fascinating.</p>

<p>In general, I found the gameplay great. The controls on the PSP
were really hard to work with, so I played on Easy. I find that
very interesting, because the first three Metal Gear Solid games
had fixed cameras. If this game were just made in that style, then
the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP would not have been a
problem. I found it very painful.</p>

<p>The recruiting and squad concept was interesting, but ultimately
very unfulfilling for me. I want to play as Snake. I only used
other people in one boss fight where Snake died and then when I
wanted to get a box closer to capture someone.</p>

<p>The comic book style cutscenes in this game were really great. I
think they looked better than MGS1 cut-scenes, so I don&#8217;t feel
like it was a cop-out.</p>

<p>The storyline revelations were very cool and the general concept
for the action was rad. I found that the game had the same great
Metal Gear themes, even though it was portable.</p>

<p>Great game!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played Half-Minute Hero after hearing a lot about it from blogs,
etc for a long time.</p>

<p>It is definitely a really unique and quirky game. I can see why
people would love it for its freshness, but after playing through
about half-a-dozen stages and seeing where it was going, it lost
my attention and I wasn&#8217;t interested in doing more.</p>

<p>I think the problem I had with it was that I had very little input
into what happened in the game. You only control the character in
the broadest way: what area they are in and what they buy. You
don&#8217;t really impact combat at all. I wonder if you could have a
game like this, where combat was INCREDIBLY fast(-paced), but
still have a lot of player involvement. I think something like the
FF13 system is the right direction. Also, I&#8217;ve thought a lot about
RPGs that are mechanically based on fighting games for similar
inspiration.</p>

game, but it is on the PSP. It&#8217;s a really cool motion comic. The
art style is beautiful and it is an interesting way to experience
Metal Gear, but it does drop a lot. In particular, it doesn&#8217;t give
you the feeling of tense enemy avoidance or the patience that the
game requires. But it is really neat.</p>

<p>I really liked the way they translated Psycho Mantis&#8217; abilities to
the form, because you can&#8217;t really recreate the controller
gimmicks. But what they did was cool.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After loving Metal Gear Acid so much, I played Metal Gear
Acid 2.</p>

<p>The opening movie of this was amazing.</p>

<p>The gameplay makes the last game feel like the first Dragon Quest:
there are so many ways the new interface is cleaner, easier, more
fluid, etc. I really like the improvements. The new gameplay
mechanics (like linkages and cover fire) where interesting, but
didn&#8217;t really make it different. But I&#8217;m fine with that, because I
just wanted more game. (The blinding mechanic was definitely new,
but very annoying.)</p>

<p>The game gives you cards in a different order from the last game
and I generally felt the weapon power-level was higher initially,
although the support cards had the same path.</p>

<p>I really liked the cell-shaded style of the 3D graphics.</p>

<p>The game does an absurd jiggling animation with the female
characters. It is ridiculous.</p>

<p>This game seems even more combat focused than the last
game. Whereas in the last game, there were many traversal levels
where combat was the best approach, in this game there are many
straight-out combat missions. This game also feels like it has a
lot less time in between boss encounters. I also noticed that
there weren&#8217;t really any &#8220;puzzle&#8221; levels, like before.</p>

<p>One thing that was close to a puzzle was the train level. It was
really cool to coax enemies into the path of the train and get
them squashed. Woo!</p>

<p>I did a little bit of grinding to get good cards, but I also made
some really stupid decks to get through some levels with a
challenge; both were fun.</p>

<p>The ending was very neat in its cinematic-ness, but the game in
general (and the bosses in particular) was a lot easier.</p>

<p>This game probably has more replay value because of the special
missions, but I didn&#8217;t do any.</p>

<p>Here are my final stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play Time: 14:24:20
Cost: 4395
Found: 45
Kills: 73
Total Damage: 15035
Clear Count: 1
Cards Collected: 41 (I don&#8217;t know what this means&#8230; maybe in the stages?)</p>

<p>I hope there will be an Acid 3.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.</p>

<p>This game is utterly insane in concept. It is a turn-based
tactical game based on the Metal Gear world, with collectible card
game elements. You need to read the Wikipedia page&#8217;s (linked
above) gameplay discussion to possibly understand how it
works. After playing it through, it is brilliant. I can&#8217;t believe
how great it is.</p>

<p>I love the gameplay. It is so deep. The final battle is
particularly epic.</p>

<p>The art is beautiful. There is some great 2D art, in addition to
the cool 3D in the game, but the 2D is definitely a lot better.</p>

<p>The story and characters are great and really &#8220;fit&#8221; in the Metal
Gear universe, even though it is a gaiden.</p>

<p>One of my favourite things in retrospect was the opening movie
that was an &#8220;action&#8221; video, but using the card-mechanics of the
whole game, so it felt really awkward and off-kilter, but in an
endearing way.</p>

<p>I found that the stealth-gameplay was pretty weak and it was
really optimized for combat, but I think that&#8217;s appropriate for
the gameplay since that&#8217;s where it really shines.</p>

<p>I think it would have a lot of replay value, although I never
played any level again, although I definitely died a lot and had
to make many attempts on some levels. In all, the game took me
19:55:01 on Normal difficulty.</p>

and really really rushed through it. I never fought any enemies

wasn&#8217;t as good as the first time. I can&#8217;t tell if it is because
I&#8217;d done it before, or because being a girl wasn&#8217;t as exciting. I

<time datetime="2011-05-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence over three days
from the 28th to the 30th. My stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Play time: 19:14:20
Save: 12 times
Continue: 18 times
Alert Phase: 51 times
Humans Killed: 97 people
Seriously Injured: 129 times
Total Damage: 29 life bars.
Life Medicine Used: 0 times.
Plants &amp; Animals Captured: 11 kinds
Meals Eaten: 28 meals
Special Item: Not used
Title: Iguana</p>

<p>I have a lot of good things to say about this game, but I have a
few bad things and comments on the above stats.</p>

<p>First, I didn&#8217;t use any life medicine, because I never realized
what it did. I guess it was like a traditional ration from the
earlier games. I&#8217;m not sure how I missed the instructions that
they did that, but I totally ignored them the whole game. It
probably would&#8217;ve made a few things easier if I hadn&#8217;t. D&#8217;oh!</p>

<p>Next, I played on Normal, because there was no &#8220;Game Over if
Spotted&#8221; on any mode except European Extreme, which I don&#8217;t have
the fortitude for. This made me really mad, because I find the
game mechanically weak unless you have to sneak, but implementing
that mode yourself with saves, reloads, etc is waaay to tedious to
actually do. As such, I think my enjoyment of the game suffered a
lot. I don&#8217;t think I can think of any areas of the game that I got
through without alerting the guards. That means that I tried to
sneak, failed, and just ran past them frantically until I got to
the next cut-scene (which stopped the alert) or found somewhere to
hide, but then I&#8217;d just do it again. Thus, the game was basically
totally broken for me. The only mechanics I really did were the
combat mechanics during boss fights, which I&#8217;ve mentioned many
times before, I really don&#8217;t like. The biggest problem though is
that by not having to do areas many times until I got them right,
I really only saw most areas for a few minutes (and in a rush at
that.) Therefore, the scenery of the game didn&#8217;t have time to sink
in and create a lasting memory for me. I think that&#8217;s really
annoying. I almost want to play it again on EE, but then my sanity
checks and I have no desire to go through the horrible combat. I
wish Kojima Productions would realize that the sneaking and the
combat difficulty can be separated. Bummer.</p>

<p>Finally, the game very inelegantly gave me the RPG-7 after a
cut-scene where Snake used it, even though I had never found it up
to that point in the game. Snake just talks about having it, then
uses it, and then I have access to it. Generally these games are
good at forcing you to get things like that, I&#8217;m surprised they
missed this one.</p>

<p>On to the praise&#8230; Most of my praise for the game focuses on
its unique story and setting.</p>

<p>A few gameplay things&#8230; Since the setting is low-tech, I really
enjoy the need to heal yourself, eat food, etc. It makes
everything feel so much more real and impacting. It&#8217;s hard to
express just how that is. This game is a lot more linear than the
previous two MGS games, although very similar in linearity to the
Game Boy Color game I really liked. Basically, there are one-way
doors that lock you from going back in the world. This makes
things constantly feel fresh and new. It works really well in the
story as well, because you are not exploring one area like the
previous games, but you are pushing forward through a jungle to a
base and then to the escape. In a similar way, some of the
fundamental formulas of Metal Gear are really broken off in this
game. The biggest, I think, is that the game does not feel
&#8220;puzzley&#8221;, but rather the challenges come about very
organically. For example, there&#8217;s always been a token mine-field
that you must pass through that you are notified about, but in
this game mines appear very organically where they sensibly
should, and no one warns you about it. Another example is the lack
of remote controlled missile puzzles, etc. A lot of the same
elements are in this game, but they feel much more real and less
abstract, which is great. Overall, I&#8217;d say that I would prefer
more Metal Gear games like this, in particular, with the low-tech,
organic worlds.</p>

<p>On a technical level, there are some great aspects. First, the
music and ambient sound is out of the park amazing. The jungle
sounds like a jungle. Second, the areas are huge and impressive,
not the tiny corridors and rooms from previous games. The models
are nice and the art direction controls the exposure of their
flaws. Third, the first-person view jokes are great.</p>

<p>The best part of the game though, as I said before, is the setting
and story.</p>

<p>I love the opening James-Bond-style movie.</p>

<p>There are many times when characters will quote people from
earlier games that fill the same role as them. For example, Naked
Snake quotes Big Boss (himself) from MG2:SS and Solid Snake from
MGS1 (although I guess in the second case that would imply that
Big Boss had a big influence on Solid and gave him that idea.)</p>

<p>The whole development of Revolver Ocelot is amazing. The subtle
reveals when he is first introduced that he is one and the same;
the relationship between him and Naked; the &#8220;origin&#8221; story they
setup; and the best part&#8212;the post-credits reveal that harkens
back to MGS1 and lays a huge foundational mystery for the whole
series. If there weren&#8217;t so many other amazing characters, Ocelot
would&#8217;ve been the star.</p>

<p>In general, all the characters have really great moments that
reveal who their characters are. The characters serve really well
to reinforce the setting&#8217;s believably and put you in the time
period. I especially like the constant chatter about old movies on
the radio.</p>

<p>But in the end, the game totally sold me on the amazing heroism of
Naked Snake and The Boss. They are so honorable and amazing,
self-sacrificing heroes. I know it sounds cheesy, but it makes me
so proud of people and touches my heart that such pure virtues are
conceivable. When Big Boss was honoring The Boss at the end, it
gave me chills and brought some tears to my eyes. I&#8217;m especially a
sucker for tragedy and it hit the spot there too. Another part I
loved the heroism of was when EVA and Snake are about to go off
towards the end of the game and the Metal Gear theme slowly starts
to play&#8230; amazing.</p>

<p>I found the philosophy of the game great too. Especially The
Boss&#8217;s speech about how enemies don&#8217;t really exist, because we&#8217;re
all human beings and can connect on that level.</p>

<p>This has hands down the best &#8220;ending sequence&#8221; of any Metal
Gear. Not just the scenes after you can play, but the whole final
sequence of getting to the end&#8212;basically from planting the bombs
to the end. It is so epic and awesome.</p>

<p>What a game. I will play it again some day.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I got Vorpal on Xbox Live Indie Games, based on reading about it
on Joystiq or something.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful 2d bullet hell shooter in the Touhou style. There
are just bosses and each of the eight characters fights five of
the other characters in a unique story about something called the
Vorpal Blade.</p>

<p>I really like the crisp graphics and the tight style of them. They
only use white, black, and red (and occasionally gray) and it
looks beautiful. I got the game in April and played it fairly
regularly since then.</p>

<p>I was playing as Xiphias and I&#8217;d never been able to beat the first
enemy until Saturday. However, once I beat him, I got to the final
boss of his story the same play-through. Something about the game
clicked and I was able to break through in do it. When I played
yesterday, I 1CC&#8217;d his story. I think the game is well-worth the
one dollar price tag and probably a lot more. I thought it was
difficult and interesting enough.</p>

<p>I plan on coming back to it once a month and working through the
other characters, but I don&#8217;t anticipate they will be much
different, so I feel able to review it now.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Score Rush every once in a while. I think I can
review it now.</p>

<p>This is a twin-stick shooter, which is a sub-genre of the shmup
that I normally hate. But, they have enough frenzy and complicated
patterns to make it worth it.</p>

<p>The game has really crazy frantic graphics that really pop
out. It&#8217;s a blast to play. I&#8217;d like to get another controller and
play two player. (I have multiple Xbox controllers, but two are
arcade sticks.)</p>

<p>I have three problems with the game.</p>

<p>First, the controllers aren&#8217;t precise enough and it is hard to do
pixel perfect dodging that&#8217;s required.</p>

<p>Second, there is a technical problem with the sound and it
constantly causes my receiver to shut off and resync. Very
annoying.</p>

<p>Third, there is too much garbage on the screen from enemies
exploding and your bullets, etc that it gets in the way of seeing
the bullets you must dodge. This is a big shooter, no-no.</p>

<p>But, for a dollar, it is an amazing game.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/05/28/Game--Metal-Gear-Solid-2--Substance--PS2--2003--0/">Game: Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance (PS2, 2003)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-05-28T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>28</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I finished playing through Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance early
this morning/late last night. I played for about 11 days, from the
17th to the 28th.</p>

<p>First, some stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Hard
Game Over if Spotted: On
Play Time: 17:56:01
Save: 14 times
Continue: 186 times
Alert Mode: 8 times
Persons: 174 killed
Rations: 83 used
Code Name: Mammoth</p>

<p>I remember playing this game when it came out. I don&#8217;t remember
beating it. Up until I fought with Fatman, I was constantly having
deja vu about the things that were going on, but I couldn&#8217;t tell
you anything that was going to happen. That totally stopped after
the Fatman fight. I guess I stopped playing at that point back in
the day?</p>

<p>I played on Hard just so that I could get the &#8220;Game Over if
Spotted&#8221; option. I wish I could turn that on at the other
difficulty levels. As I&#8217;ve said before, I really dislike the
combat in Metal Gear and when you play on Hard, the bosses are
significantly stronger and it is very tedious and boring, in my
opinion. But, I think the Game Over if Spotted is amazing, because
it forces you to figure out how to get by undetected. I love
that. Given that though, I don&#8217;t know how it was possible that I
ever got any Alert Modes. Perhaps because I killed a guard,
another saw the body, they called reinforcements, and that counts
as Alert Mode.</p>

<p>Obviously I continued A LOT to be able to get through
undetected. I don&#8217;t really care, because it doesn&#8217;t make it any
easier, because you still have to go room-by-room undetected.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really remember anything about the story of this game, so
it was nice to be learn it. It connects really well with what I
remember from MGS4. I&#8217;m excited to continue the saga.</p>

<p>One of my favourite aspects of the game was the way it continually
called back to earlier games; sometimes in a self-acknowledging
way. There were many many scenes, angles, etc that were pulled
right from earlier games. I especially like how at the end of the
game, they integrate that into the story. I really like the way
the game is about video games and people who play them, in a
sense.</p>

<p>One of my favourite moments was when Snake tells Raiden he can get
more ammo from him, Raiden asks him how he has so much ammo, Snake
points at his bandanna and says &#8220;Infinite Ammo&#8221;. Of course, in
MGS1 if you save Meryl, the next time you play you get a bandanna
that gives you infinite ammo. =)</p>

<p>Another great moment for me was when Snake and Otacon depart at an
elevator and the theme song slowly swells. Very touching.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t mind Raiden at all. Of course, the cat has long been out
of the bag that the game isn&#8217;t about him. I don&#8217;t remember
thinking it was weird at all when I was younger either. I do
really like how they initially call him Snake&#8212;of course,
because, it&#8217;s just a code name, but change it. I also like how at
the end of the game, when Snake finally appears in his sneaking
suit, he says, &#8220;Have you been waiting long?&#8221; or something to
Raiden, and, of course, to the player.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the game were great. I especially like that
guards can follow footprints better now.</p>

<p>There were a few things about the gameplay that bugged me.</p>

<p>First, Raiden doesn&#8217;t start with the means to tranquilize people,
so I felt compelled to kill pretty early, whereas I got through
Snake&#8217;s part without killing anyone. I was planning on doing that,
but it quickly failed. Later in the game, there are many many
places that are very combat focused (the tag team with Snake, for
example) and that&#8217;s not what the game is about for me, so it
bugged me.</p>

<p>Second, the end of the bomb disposal segment was annoying because
I got to the area of the final bomb with almost 200 seconds to
spare, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get close enough to the
bomb. (You had to crawl on a rail in the water, on Hard.) And so I
had to run all the way back two or three times, even though I got
there perfectly. Relatedly annoying was the distance you needed to
be before you jumped into water&#8212;to far. I did it accidentally a
lot.</p>

<p>Third, the swimming controls are awful. Ugh.</p>

<p>Fourth, escort missions suck. Ugh.</p>

<p>At the very end of the game, there is a huge spike in combat
difficulty, especially with the last two bosses. I probably tried
30 times on each. I almost gave up and just watched the ending of
YouTube, but decided to man up and do it. It worked out well too,
because in the end I beat the final boss without using any
rations. I had enough practice with his attacks. =)</p>

<p>Great game!</p>

<time datetime="2011-05-28T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>28</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Late last year I got エスプガルーダII from someone on the SHMUPS
forum. I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until January, when I
stopped playing Mushi every day. My scores as of now are:
- ESPGaluda II - 360 Novice - Asagi: All-Clear. 217,480,251 points. #669 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Black Label Novice - Seseri: All-Clear. 229,344,460 points. #938 #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - Arrange - Tateha: Stage 2. 2,888,170 points. #1320 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - Omake! - Asagi: All-Clear. 496,851,202 points. #hiscore #1cc
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Asagi: Stage 2. 1,615,157 points. #1675 #hiscore
- ESPGaluda II - 360 - Ageha: Stage 3. 12,034,604 points. #771 #hiscore</p>

<p>I was able to easily 1CC the easy modes, but I&#8217;ve been working on
the normal modes for some time.</p>

<p>The art in the game is very pretty, but not as fantastical as
Mushi. Most of the enemies are human (they leave blood stains on
the ground, eww) or normal military-looking things, which I find
kind of boring. Nevertheless, the art, given the style, is
great.</p>

<p>The music on the first level is AMAZING, but the music for the
rest of the game is just so-so.</p>

<p>The scoring system is interesting. Basically, you get gems and
gold. Killing enemies drops gems. You can use gems to slow down
time. When you destroy an enemy and time is slowed, then all their
bullets become gold. (If you try to slow down time, but don&#8217;t have
gems, time speeds up. If you kill enemies in this mode, they drop
gold. Also, you are always getting points just for being in this
mode.) Now, time is slower for the bullets, but not the
characters, so by slowing down time you build up many bullets on
the screen and you can cash them all in for gold if you picked a
good time (where good time means you can kill the enemy.) This is
a really neat risk/reward system because you can spend gems to
make it easier to dodge or to get high scores; and, getting high
scores means there needs to be many bullets, and you need to
accurately gauge if you can kill the enemy with the number of gems
you have, otherwise all those bullets will need to be dodged.</p>

<p>While it is very interesting, I don&#8217;t find the game as enjoyable
as Mushi. It doesn&#8217;t have the same pace or something. I&#8217;ve played
it every day for about six months and I think I will play it much
less frequently, and spend more time with Mushi.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve also been playing Decimation X3.</p>

<p>This is basically a bullet-hell take on Space Invaders. You can
only move on the X-axis at the bottom of the screen and the
enemies go back and forth from the top. It is totally out of
control insane. I love it.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it is the lake of precise control and the
inability to distinguish bullets from falling rubble (that is
safe). Notice that Xona has the same problems with Score Rush.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, great game. I plan on continuing to play it
regularly.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/05/17/Game--Metal-Gear--Ghost-Babel--GBC--2000--0/">Game: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel (GBC, 2000)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-05-17T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>17</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel over the past three
days. This is a Game Boy Color game. At first, I assumed it would
basically be just like the first two Metal Gear games for the
MSX. It is, but it has clearly greatly evolved. This is the
perfect 2D Metal Gear. It makes me think (like I think for so many
series) how much better the series would be if it stuck in 2D but
got bigger, better, and more beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how many of the mechanics from MGS they were able to
integrate into the game. For example, looking around walls is done
brilliantly. Tapping on walls works great. All the weapons
return. It&#8217;s really a spectacular game. In some ways I&#8217;d say it is
better than MGS because many mechanics actually appear multiple
times. For example, there&#8217;s really only one time you need to use
the Nikita Missiles in MGS (when you destroy the only electrical
panel in the game), but there are many instances in this
game. Same thing with the C4; there&#8217;s one occurrences in MGS, but
many in this. I like the richness of that.</p>

<p>This game is technically linear and broken into stages, but in
many ways that is totally fine and a little inaccurate. It&#8217;s a bit
inaccurate because there are many stages where you revisit areas
from previous stages (but that&#8217;s a severe minority.) It&#8217;s totally
fine because if you really break it down, MGS was linear too:
there is very sparse back-tracking. For example, once you go to
Otacon&#8217;s lab, there&#8217;s no reason to ever go back, even though you
could. This game just turns that admission into something enforced
by the game. Still though, each stage is really large and they
individually contain a lot of back-tracking. But really,
back-tracking (the need to go to old areas) and open world (the
technical ability to revisit old areas) are not valuable in and of
themselves. What is valuable is when the world feels &#8220;real&#8221; and
not artificial like a traditional stage-based game. This game
really makes the world feel real because of the way that things
connect and the size of the areas generally. In fact, I really see
a lot of this game in MGS4, which has a similar open-world
stage-based setup, where many areas have internal sections that
don&#8217;t allow back-tracking.</p>

<p>I really want to think about this game as the basis for another 2D
Metal Gear-style game.</p>

<p>Here are the stats that I got:</p>

<p>Play Time: 02:56:07
Being Found: 001 times
Enemies: 000 killed
Rations: 008 used
Code Name: Spider</p>

<p>I was able to get such scores by using save states and always
restarting a room if I got caught. I don&#8217;t feel this is cheating
because I still had to overcome the obstacle myself. It&#8217;s really
an efficient way to do the traditional MGS Extreme mode where you
get a Game Over when you get caught. If I made an MGS-style game,
it would have this be an option and have it really stream-lined
(maybe Super Meat Boy streamlined.)</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So I thought I was going to play Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. I
got it all ready and played it&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t at all what I
expected.</p>

<p>First, a little background. My favourite part about Metal Gear is
sneaking without being noticed and without interacting with the
guards in any direct way. I dislike using weapons and I dislike
using chokes or throws. My least favourite parts of Metal Gear
games are when you are forced to interact&#8212;such as running up the
stairs in the 2nd and 3rd games in the series or the boss battles
in general.</p>

<p>I was expecting VR Missions to be hundreds of bite-sized
guard/room configurations I had to get through in this way. It is
sort of that, except that the vast majority of the content
revolves crucially around using weapons to kill the
enemies&#8212;going so far as to prevent the goal from appearing until
you destroy them.</p>

<p>I did all the No Weapon Sneaking mode missions in about twenty
minutes&#8230; looked through the other options&#8230; and decided to
ignore them and move on to the next game in the Metal Gear
series. I wonder if the MGS2 VR missions will be better?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes over the course
of about a week. This is a remake of Metal Gear Solid with a bit
of new gameplay, new cinematics, and generally improved graphics.</p>

<p>I had never played this remake, but I played the original many
times when it came out. I really enjoyed playing it again. It was
very nostalgic for me.</p>

<p>I noticed a lot of homages to the first two games. For example,
you meet Meryl in a bathroom; you fist fight with Gray Fox; there
is a key that changes with the temperature; and you fight in an
elevator against an assassination squad. All these happened in
Metal Gear: Solid Snake. Naturally, the themes are the
same&#8212;especially the idea that everyone betrays Snake.</p>

<p>The one annoying thing in the game was the tortue scene. They
don&#8217;t tell you in the dialogue which button resists and which
button gives up. As soon as it started, I tried to call someone on
the Codec to find that out. Of course, the give up button was the
call button. Doh! I hadn&#8217;t saved in hours, so I couldn&#8217;t do it
again. What a bummer. Meryl died because of it.</p>

<p>Game Level: Easy

Save: 12 times
Continue: 21 times
Alert Mode: 31 times

the last little bit. The game is really clever and unique. The
puzzles were nothing quite like I&#8217;ve experienced before and the

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake over the last
three or four days. I played the MSX2 version that comes with
Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.</p>

<p>This game is the true prequel to Metal Gear Solid. The story is
explicitly a sequel, whereas the original Metal Gear is obviously
ret-con&#8217;d to be about the same stuff. The themes definitely
originate here: the pacifism is so much more clear. The gameplay
gets a whole lot deeper in this game with the radar, the guards
hearing you, etc. There are very direct callbacks to this game in
later entries in the series&#8212;such as climatic fist fights.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game. I initially found it much harder than
the first one because the guards are so much more perceptive and
the first area is a tightly confined space, but as I played I got
a lot better. Also, it is harder to be glutted with ammo and
rations, but you definitely get to that point by the end of the
game. I was initially confused and annoyed about when you were
allowed to save, but then I realized it was on area transitions
(when there was a loading screen) and so I was able to use that to
my advantage when I was going to a place I was scared of.</p>

<p>Here are my play-through stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Easy
Play Time: 4:59:44
Save: 27
Continue: 17
Alert Mode: 117
Humans Killed: 246

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Metal Gear. I played the MSX2 version that

Metal Gear for the NES a lot when I was young&#8230; it was one of the
few games my dad played. But I don&#8217;t remember doing very well at
it.</p>

<p>I played through this game on the new &#8220;Easy&#8221; setting and used
online maps to help out. When you beat the game, it gives you some
stats:</p>

<p>Mission record:

<p>I thought the game was really fun and a great start to the
series. I really liked that there was fourth-wall breaking humour
even in this version. I thought the game was really hard, until I
realized that you could go in and out of rooms to totally stock up
on supplies. Once I realized that, I was flush with stuff and
found it a lot easier.</p>

<p>I plan on going through all the Metal Gear games over the next
little bit.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished Shatter.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game. It has really compelling Arkanoid style
game, but with a &#8220;bullet hall&#8221; influence as well, as there are
constant barrages of blocks flying at you, visual overload through
the scoring system, gigantic bosses, etc. It&#8217;s really a blast to
play.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is amazing. The graphics are pretty.</p>

<p>I have a short list of games that I play once a month because I
want to enjoy a little arcadey action. This is the first PS3 game
to make it on the list.</p>

<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like so much was the circular arenas,
because I found that my brain was really bad at predicting the
ball&#8217;s movement on them.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played through Soldner X-2 on the
PS3.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never really played a &#8220;Euroshmup&#8221; before, but this definitely
is. The health bar is really weird and it leads to sloppy design
with unavoidable hits. The hit boxes are humungous too. I beat the
game in two sitings, 1-CCing. (I played all but the last two
levels on the first playthrough. Then I played again to unlock the
keys for the second to last level. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the
unreasonable task on unlocking the last levels, because I read in
a FAQ that it requires a random drop from an enemy. Lame!)</p>

<p>The game is very pretty, but the gameplay is weak and the weapons
are really un-exciting. This was a bad purchase overall.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Shoot 1UP, another game from Mommy&#8217;s Best
Games. I also beat this in one sitting on the first try. Very
easy. The gimmick of this game is that you are controlling all
your extra lives at once and can spread them out or hold them
close. I played through the game with the entire cluster as a
single ship. I ended the game with 29 ships (30 is the max, I
think.) I liked the frenzy of the screen when I had sacrificed a
ship or had the ghost going. Overall, I felt it was pretty
uninspired. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t use it to show someone shooters,
I typically use Mushi for that.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Last month there was a sale and I bought Infinity Blade for the
iPhone. One of my favourite recent games was Shadow Complex for
the Xbox from the same developer, so I was expecting Infinity
Blade to be great. I&#8217;d heard it was a lot like Punch Out!!! for
the NES, so I had high hopes.</p>

<p>I played it fairly regularly for a few weeks, but I haven&#8217;t
touched it in almost a month, so I probably won&#8217;t play it
again.</p>

<p>I found the game to be very rote. I could get through basically
every battle with the same simple technique. Although there was
the advancement system that made you do more damage, etc, I never
felt very powerful because the enemies scaled as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad the game has been successful for Chair, but I really
don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s too shallow for me and it is on a device I
really dislike for games. I hope that Chair goes back to Shadow
Complex, or similar games.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Rez on the Dreamcast.</p>

<p>This is a very acclaimed game that I&#8217;ve heard a lot about. It&#8217;s
well-known for its synergy between music, sound effects, visuals,
and actions. It is a Panzer Dragoon-style rail shooter with a
trance soundtrack and trippy theme. You start exploring a computer
system, but as you progress it implies that this computer system
has somehow consumed the real world and you are freeing it and
thus recreating Earth.</p>

<p>The game has really great style and fun gameplay. I had to play
each level (of 5) twice before beating them and I played the 1st
level a third time so I could get 100% to unlock level 5. I did
this over two days. I read online that there are unlockables for
getting more perfect scores, but the gameplay didn&#8217;t compel me to
finish that part of the game.</p>

<p>This game solidifies more for me that I dislike the Dragoon-style
games, probably because I first played Sin &amp; Punishment and
like the ability to dodge too much. I find the gameplay
surprisingly shallow: the key is to chain and destroy things in
basically the order they appear on the screen.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad I played the game because I have more context
for thinking about games and a better understanding of the history
of this genre and a knowledge of this influential game, but I
won&#8217;t be trying to complete it 100%.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Blazing Lazers a few nights ago and tonight. This
is a shooter from 1989 on the PC Engine.</p>

<p>I found the weapons to be really cool. I particularly liked the
laser beam weapon that spread into weird shapes.</p>

<p>I found the hit box really annoying. The hit box is bigger than
the ship graphic and wider than it is vertically, so it is really
difficult to dodge properly, at least when compared to the modern
danmaku shooters I normally play.</p>

<p>I used save states before and after bosses, plus throughout the
final boss battle. In fact, my wife helped me restart a million
times through a particular explosion.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the game was fun, but I like modern shooters
better. I didn&#8217;t like it as much as the shooter that is in Retro
Game Challenge, which is supposedly based on this game.</p>

<time datetime="2011-04-14T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Apr</span> <span class='day'>14</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played through Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy. I found out about
the game through <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/2007/02/best-undiscovered-neo-geo-games.html">Racketboy&#8217;s Undiscovered Neo-Geo Games</a> list.</p>

<p>The game is a side-scrolling action game with two planes of
movement. You can jump from one plane to the other and most of the
action in the game revolves around quickly and accurately getting
on the correct plane. Even though there is jumping, this isn&#8217;t
really a platforming game, because it stays on one path mostly and
there are rarely obstacles to jump over. There are four
worlds&#8212;each with two levels, one mid-boss, and one main boss;
followed by a final level with only a boss&#8212;which is actually a
six boss rush.</p>

<p>There are some interesting mechanics in the game. You can grab
things from a distance by stretching your arm. This allows you to
grab things from far away, as well as punch from a distance. Most
of the &#8220;puzzles&#8221; are about doing this effectively. There is a very
low time limit on the game and there are items that allow increase
it by 5, 10, or 20 seconds. I thought this would be stressful, but
I didn&#8217;t notice it at all. (That might have been because I
credit-fed.)</p>

<p>The animation is not nearly as good as Metal Slug, but it is
decent. There is a little bit of quirkiness. For example, there is
a funny animal in the final stage&#8230; the enemies will often wave
white flags at you&#8230; etc. There are some good details too: for
example, most vehicles are destructible and you can throw their
parts at the enemies once they are destroyed.</p>

<p>Overall, the game had a very basic and repetitive design. Most of
the enemies and bosses were dealt with in the same way. I didn&#8217;t
feel it was very deep. I could imagine feeling it was a bit deeper
if I restricted my credit usage. I would typically use 2 on a boss
and .5 on a level. I assume that most of the challenge of getting
credit usage down would be very much luck: enemies hit for a
lot.</p>

<p>I played through it in under an hour. I&#8217;d say it was worth
it.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through Gunstar Heroes last night and tonight. I&#8217;m a
shameless Treasure fanboy, but I&#8217;d never played this, so I thought
that I would do it. It was pretty awesome. It&#8217;s really remarkable
how many many enemies they were able to get on the screen at
once. The game is really tight and fun. I was able to beat it up
until the shmup part with only one or two continues. After that, I
save-stated after each boss battle so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do huge
segments over again. I really enjoyed the game. I stuck with the
flame-thrower weapon the whole time as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=335">This review</a> of a different Treasure game talks a lot about Gunstar
in a way that I couldn&#8217;t do better. Check that out.</p>

cool.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good sign.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few nights, I&#8217;ve played through the first two worlds
of Mischief Makers on the N64. Overall, I found the game very fun
and interesting. It has a totally unique mechanic: grabbing,
catching, and throwing enemies. And, although it is a 2D
platformer, it is rendered in 3D and Treasure clearly had a lot of
fun with 3D tricks and depth tricks. These aren&#8217;t done perfectly,
but I can imagine an alternate history where games like this are
the ones that became popular, rather than games like Super Mario
64 (which I dislike(d).)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping playing the game because my emulator is too flakey
with it. The sound is really messed up, some of the textures
aren&#8217;t displaying (so that platforms are just invisible), and the
controls are really unresponsive. Even if all that were perfect,
I&#8217;m not sure this is the best game for me to playing. From what
I&#8217;ve seen, it isn&#8217;t Treasure&#8217;s best work, but I&#8217;m glad to have
experienced it to know what the deal is with it.</p>

<p>I heard about it from <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mischiefmakers/mischiefmakers.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>; I recommend reading
their article.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat Persona 3 Portable. It was awesome. I&#8217;d never played a
Persona game before and the other Megaten game I played was a lot
different. This game was amazing.</p>

<p>I loved the collecting of Personas and the deep social link
system. I got all but 4 MAX Social Links and 5 Personas. (I didn&#8217;t
MAX Aeon, Fortune, Temperance, or Priestess.)</p>

<p>I took me 87 hours and 36 minutes to play through the game. I
haven&#8217;t played a game for so long in a while.</p>

<p>I really liked the way understanding your enemy&#8217;s weaknesses was
crucial to beating them. I was a little annoyed at how spikey the
difficulty of bosses was in the middle of the game. I had to do
more grinding than I would&#8217;ve preferred.</p>

<p>I played as the Male main character. I&#8217;d like to do it again and
get MAX everything. I&#8217;d also like to play as the Female MC. My
Male MC was named after me; it&#8217;s fun to have the characters
talk about you. I plan on naming my Female MC &#8220;Buffy
Summers&#8221;. =)</p>

<p>I wrote a little program to compute the optimal way to make my
Personas. It was neat to do.</p>

<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend this game. I intend to play it two more times
and play Persona 4.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/03/06/Game--Demon-s-Souls--PS3--2009--0/">Game: Demon&#8217;s Souls (PS3, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-03-06T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>06</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I finished Demon&#8217;s Souls, by FromSfotware. I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.</p>

<p>I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.</p>

<p>This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you&#8217;ve &#8220;spent&#8221; the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<p>A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how &#8220;unforgiving&#8221;, or how there is no &#8220;hand-holding&#8221;. I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I&#8217;m not sure what hand-holding I would&#8217;ve wanted&#8212;there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you&#8217;ll never be caught off guard. So many &#8220;action RPGs&#8221;
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon&#8217;s Souls just requires caution and care.</p>

<p>So, Demon&#8217;s Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it&#8217;s a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.</p>

<p>As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;. In those games, you can&#8217;t &#8220;spoil&#8221; the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon&#8217;s Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it&#8217;s not really significant. I liked that
about it.</p>

<p>My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 2-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I&#8217;d have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.</p>

<p>After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote&#8212;I didn&#8217;t really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I&#8217;d have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.</p>

<p>I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;d be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would&#8217;ve just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;bug&#8221; I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.</p>

Faith: 25
Luck: 7</p>

<p>Soul Level: 91</p>

<p>Throughout the game I used this equipment:</p>

<p>Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow</p>

<p>This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it&#8217;s just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>For approximately the last year, I&#8217;ve been doing a puzzle from
Picross 3D every day. Today I finally got a &#8220;Perfect&#8221; score on
every puzzle in the game. I will move on to my next puzzle game. I
really like doing a puzzle every day, because I think it helps
keep a part of my mind fresh.</p>

<p>I thought that Picross 3D was easier than Picross DS, in
general. There were a few things that were a little harder, but
overall the algorithm for solving a puzzle is a bit simpler. Still
it was fun to do and interesting to see what your creation was
after the fact.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/14/Game--Darksiders--X360--2010--0/">Game: Darksiders (X360, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-14T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>14</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I started playing Darksiders.</p>

<p>I was interested in the game because Vinny on the Giantbomb
cast was really into it and it sounded neat. I liked the idea of a
non-Nintendo Zelda game that focused a bit more on combat.</p>

<p>However, I didn&#8217;t finish the game and I&#8217;m selling it because it
really didn&#8217;t take me and I disliked it quite a bit.</p>

<p>On the first day, I was really struck by how bad the voice
acting was and how lame the story is. I think the core problem is
that it takes itself so incredibly seriously that it is so
laughable to hear gravely voices and faux &#8220;darkness&#8221;. Another
thing I noticed was that, unlike Zelda, it does a poor job at
hiding its linearity. This was a little bit aggravating and made
the world feel a lot smaller than Hyrule. The biggest problem that
I noticed the first day, though, was how weak the brawler combat
was. It was a strange mixture between to easy (X X X X X B X X X Y
Y Y repeat) and to hard (the defense capabilities are almost
totally inadequate because of the input lag and weird hitboxes.)
Now, Zelda doesn&#8217;t have very good combat either, but at least it
is a small part of the game. In contrast, Darksiders puts a lot of
emphasis on combat but doesn&#8217;t have an adequate system. I think I
have been forever spoiled by Bayonetta.</p>

<p>On the second day, I continued to notice the combat and
actually began to think it was properly boring. The enemies take
way too long to kill and becomes pure tedium. I did one of the
first proper dungeons and was impressed with how big it was. But
when it wasn&#8217;t clear that I hadn&#8217;t finished and area and had to
backtrack A LOT, it was annoying. I ended that day at the first
big boss battle.</p>

<p>On the third day, I finished that boss battle. Man, that was
bad. The wild camera and huge hitboxes were maximally frustrating
and I almost considered stopping then, but I wanted to get through
the boss to ensure that I was uninterested in the game and not
just frustrated by a boss.  Well, I beat it and continued with the
quest. Here&#8217;s a note I wrote: &#8220;This game is soooo tedious.&#8221; There
is this weird genre-mixing segment shortly after that boss battle
that really didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>I decided to sell the game after stopping for the night. I was
originally going to just use Amazon sales, but then I noticed I
could trade it in. Wow! Amazon Trade-In is cool!</p>

<p>Total Time: 4:31:42
Combat Time: 1:13:38
Kills: 815
Deaths: 6
Distance: 51.8 miles
Souls: 14395
Combo: 30

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/09/Game--3D-Dot-Game-Heroes--PS3--2010--0/">Game: 3D Dot Game Heroes (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing 3D Dot Game Heroes.</p>

<p>I played for three nights. The first night I just started the
game and fooled around. The next night I got up to the Aqua temple
(7/15ths through the game). The next night (tonight) I got to the
end of the Aqua temple and the game crashed as I was leaving the
temple and I lost all my progress for the night. I do not tolerate
bugs like this, so I&#8217;m not interested in continuing the game.</p>

<p>There were some things I liked about this game: the quirky
graphics are very fun, especially the way that modern particle,
liquid, and reflection effects are used to accentuate the visuals;
the gigantic sword is cool; the core Zelda 1 gameplay is fun.</p>

<p>However, there are a few things I did not like: the movement is
not grid-based, so it is very easy to get slightly ajar from
enemies (who do move in a grid) and miss them when not powered up
despite standing in front of them; similarly, it is pretty easy to
get stuck on a corner for the same reason; the world is large (it
is the size of Zelda 3) but it feels really empty (there is a
Zelda 1 amount of stuff); and, obviously, the game breaking
bug.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve decided to drop it, I looked at the GameFAQs
page. It talks a lot about side quests and extra swords, etc, that
you can get. That sounds like it would be fun and add
replayability, but these things seem really buried in the
nose-to-the-grind-stone gameplay. I didn&#8217;t notice many hooks
during my play-through of half the game. I&#8217;m sure if the game
wasn&#8217;t broken, though, I&#8217;d want to stick around and do some of
them.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/07/Game--Vanquish--PS3--2010--0/">Game: Vanquish (PS3, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-02-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Vanquish. Amazing.</p>

<p>After playing Bayonetta, I was convinced that Platinum Games
were one of the greatest game companies ever. On paper, I&#8217;d never
have bought Vanquish, but when I saw that it was made by Platinum,
I had to try it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really played a third-person
shooter. I&#8217;ve played third-person platform games with a little
shooting&#8212;like Musashi and Tomb Raider. I think the closest I&#8217;ve
come is Parasite Eve on the PS1. I&#8217;ve certainly never played
anything in the modern &#8220;cover-based&#8221; shooter genre. But, oh man,
this game is amazing.</p>

<p>I love the cover aspect of it. It makes it feel very &#8220;real&#8221; and
gives an odd rhythm to the extreme excitement of being in the open
and the ability to relax a little behind cover. The game can
become very methodical, and I like that.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that you were traveling with a &#8220;squad&#8221; most of
the time. Even though the AIs revealed that they didn&#8217;t really do
anything (they never seemed to ever kill any enemies.) It was
still fun to have them around, interacting with you and the
environment. It was a nice way to have stupid dialogue in between
action too.</p>

<p>The game is rated M. Like Bayonetta, though, there is basically
no violence against humans&#8212;just robots. So, it is not offensive
to me. The few times (in cinematics) when there is human violence,
it is quite tame. The language is pretty bad though&#8212;however, I
listened to it in Japanese and for me personally, reading a swear
has SOOOO much less impact that hearing one, so I wasn&#8217;t bothered
at all.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this, but this game is actually
faster paced than Bayonetta. It is so fast sometimes, that I
actually got a little sick playing the game and had to take
breathers. =) I&#8217;m an old fart, I guess. The amount of attention
and speed the game takes is so exhausting. Some nights, I would
schedule three hours or so to play, but I had to stop after two
because I was just so tired in the head with the crazy action. I
loved it though.</p>

<p>There are some funny little details in the game. For example,
you can surprise some robots who are dancing on their
break. Another detail: there&#8217;s a soldier that you save in the
beginning, and the game goes out of its way to show you later on
how he gets shot shortly afterwards&#8212;as if it is saying how
fruitless your action was.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of the game were a few of the &#8220;cheap&#8221;
one-hit kills. For example, if you don&#8217;t destroy a robot all the
way, it will chase you and explode, killing you in one hit. There
are a few enemies that shoot lasers that kill in one hit. This is
most frustrating when they are behind you and you don&#8217;t see them
power it up. But, the number one most frustrating thing is the
&#8220;Unknown&#8221; enemy. This thing is death. It can instantly kill you if
you let it get close at all. I could only kill them by spamming
EMPs and using the melee Disc Launcher attack&#8212;over and
over. Yikes.</p>

<p>I played on Normal difficulty and never used a Checkpoint&#8212;I
effectively &#8220;1cc&#8217;d&#8221; the game. Here are my stats:</p>

<p>Difficulty: Normal
Total Score: 265,740
Space Score: 9740
Mission Time: 5:33:33
Cover Usage: 33.99%
Distance Traveled: 34488
Munitions Fired: 32927
Deaths: 0
Confirmed Friendlies K.I.A.: 589
Wounded Friendlies Assisted: 35
Confirmed Kills: 960
Pangloss Statues Destroyed: 25
Developers Destroyed: 77</p>

<p>I wish I could&#8217;ve kept track of the total time I played. (The
&#8220;Mission Time&#8221; is the amount of time in all the final, completed
runs of levels.) I would guess that my actual play time was three
or four times more than that, because I had to repeat so many
levels so many times to get a perfect run. However, I never played
anything more times than necessary to get passed.</p>

<p>While when I beat Bayonetta, I immediately played through EVERY
difficulty level and got EVERY item; with Vanquish I don&#8217;t feel
the need to totally destroy it and do everything. Maybe it is
because I have some other games waiting to be
played&#8230; nevertheless, I love this game! I will definitely play
it again in the next year at the next difficulty level.</p>

<p>Hoorah!</p>

<p>The story was incomprehensible to me after about 5 scenes and it

<p>It is very hard to tell how good your decisions are for the long

<p>Some of the controls are really bad&#8212;like turning your knights</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t yet understand how height works because, for example, magic

<h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/31/Game--Lost-Odyssey--X360--2008--0/">Game: Lost Odyssey (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2011-01-31T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Lost Odyssey last night. While playing
this game, it was hard to not compare it to Final Fantasy 13, a
game I loved a ton.</p>

<p>My completed game save reads: &#8220;43,521G; 047:09 play time; Kaim
54/Seth 54/Ming 42/Sarah 51/Jansen 51/Cooke 42/Mack 42/Sed
43/Tolten 50&#8221;. During the majority of the game, I rotated through
all the characters, replacing characters with whoever was lowest
level, although I kept Kaim and Seth in the party always (if I was
allowed to.) However, right at the end, I fought the final battle
once (and mercilessly died), so I spent some time grinding with a
Kaim/Seth/Sarah/Jansen/Tolten party and got them up many levels
above everyone else. That was probably a bad idea, because Ming
ended up so weak comparatively in the final FINAL battle.</p>

<p>As I played, I wrote down some notes, which I will expand on
below, in the order I wrote them originally.</p>

<p>The battle animations in this game are laughable compared to
FF13. The characters stand almost motionless looking at each other
waiting to be attacked. This is particularly bad when you (or the
enemies) have status effects, like Blind, which cause them to
miss, because you watch an animation of your character running up,
hitting the enemy, the enemy recoiling in pain, and then the word
&#8220;Miss&#8221; appears over them. I understand the LO has a turn-based
system (which was definitely good for strategy), but they could
have implemented some of &#8220;time is frozen&#8221; style while commands
were input, and had some more movement during the battle. The idle
animations on the characters were great though; particular Cooke
and Mack with their adjusting for packs and taunting the
enemy.</p>

<p>The most amazing part of this game were the &#8220;Thousand Years of
Dreams&#8221; segments. There were some nights when all I would do was
find and &#8220;watch&#8221; these. For a little background, as Kaim (and the
other immortals) have experiences, they are reminded of past
events in their life. Those &#8220;dreams&#8221; are audio/visual/textual
presentations of a short story. Rather than just bland text on the
screen, like the FF13 Datalog, interesting music plays while the
text slows appears on screen. The text is synchronized with light
audio (like a door opening or a baby&#8217;s cry) and sometimes the text
itself is moving (like dropping in from above, etc.) This style is
AMAZING. It makes reading the story very interesting and the use
of silence and sound makes it really evocative of emotions. In
addition, the stories themselves are incredibly interesting. You
really get to know and understand Kaim&#8217;s character. The message of
the game is unmistakable and perfectly shown through these: the
despair of Kaim&#8217;s loneliness, anti-war/violence, the beauty of the
small things in human life, the importance of family, etc. I read
on Wikipedia about these and here&#8217;s what it said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lost Odyssey&#8217;s &#8220;Thousand Years of Dreams&#8221; were penned by an<br/>award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, who<br/>worked directly with the game&#8217;s producer Hironobu Sakaguchi on<br/>Kaim&#8217;s backstory, while Sakaguchi alone wrote the game&#8217;s main<br/>story. The memory sequences were translated into English by<br/>*REDACTED* Rubin, a respected Harvard professor who also translated the<br/>works of novelist Haruki Murakami. While Rubin originally<br/>objected to what he perceived as &#8220;adding to the world&#8217;s supply of<br/>senseless violence,&#8221; he relented after viewing the material and<br/>being &#8220;shocked&#8221; at its pacifist message and &#8220;vivid<br/>imagery&#8221;.</p></blockquote>


<p>I want to give my save file to others so they can just watch these
segments.</p>

<p>On the subject of sound and music, the audio in this game is
really good. The game does a really good job of having ambient
music and sound appropriate to the areas you are in. For example,
on a mountain you can hear a light breeze, in a forest you can
here birds, in a factory you can hear machinery, etc. In addition,
the actual music for battles and cinematics is really good. One
part that was particularly interesting was a sequence between Sed
and Seth that was funny and this music played that was a riff on
the &#8220;chocobo&#8221; music from FF6. It was really interesting to hear
Uematsu riff on himself like that.</p>

<p>The geometry and texture work on the environments is really
high-class. Apart from FF13, I haven&#8217;t played anything with better
looking environments.</p>

<p>There were some gameplay segments that really sucked
though. For example, it felt like you were escaping from an
exploding (or freezing) building half a dozen times in the game
and that got old. The freezing one was actually the worst because
you had to stay in front of the fringe of cold, rather than fight
an actual timer. There were a few annoying &#8220;mini-games&#8221;: escaping
from monsters in a ship by doing a long QTE was annoying;
defending a city by defeating 4 bosses in a restricted amount of
time (I think I had to do it 15 times before I won; the worst was
when I only had one left once and it triggered the &#8220;losing&#8221;
animation just as I was about to touch it and when it was nowhere
near the city); etc.</p>

<p>The character models aren&#8217;t very good (compared to FF13),
particular with regard to the eyes and mouths of the
characters. However, the textures on them are really
good&#8212;especially on the faces actually. The textures have some
really strange details though. For example, two characters (Ming
and Sarah) have ridiculous cleavage-revealing outfits and there
are quite a few shots where attention is given to them. Now that&#8217;s
pretty standard, but even a casual glance at Ming will make you
notice that she has near-translucent skin and you can clearly see
veins on chest. It&#8217;s really weird. Sarah has another strange
breast detail: she has a small birthmark-ish bump on the
right-side of her left breast. I think what made me remember this
is that so often in video games women are purely sex symbols and
their bodies are exaggerated to &#8220;perfect&#8221; male fantasies, but in
this game, while their outfits are clearly cut from the same
cloth, their actual bodies are reasonably realistic. (Actually
Ming&#8217;s body is NOT realistic, her breasts are almost as large as
her head.)</p>

<p>On the subject of the models, the cinematic models are
/really/ different and really good.</p>

<p>On the subject of Ming&#8217;s outfit, once thing interesting about it
is how it looks like her palace in a weird way. What I mean is, it
looks like the type of person who would design her palace to look
like /that/ would clearly wear something with /those/
elements. Compare <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=lost+odyssey+ming&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=2gNHTZOlDJKCsQPRlP3tCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=803">pictures of Ming</a> and [[http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=803&amp;tbs=isch:1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lost+odyssey+numara+palace&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=][pictures of the
palace]]. Both have a &#8220;wispy&#8221; and &#8220;tendrily&#8221; style about them.</p>

<p>Another graphical thing: The &#8220;liquid&#8221; in the game looks
unbelievable bad. Especially when it is on the characters
(e.g. tears.) Wow. So bad.</p>

<p>I loved the part of the game when the party split up. It
reminded me so much of FF6. Very cool.</p>

<p>I had a really frustrating time in the second-to-last
dungeon. I walked around for 10 minutes, then died from
petrify. So I re-specced and tried again. I walked around for 20
minutes and pressed a button that released an enemy much more
powerful than any boss I&#8217;d ever fought that was optional, but that
you couldn&#8217;t run from, so I died. I noted not to press those
buttons and tried again. I walked around for a little until 2
hours, then I accidentally pressed one of those buttons (because
it didn&#8217;t look the same from the angle I approached it at) and
died again. I gave up for the night with that, having made no
progress after almost 3 hours.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the story of this game. The combat was not
spectacular, although the ring system kept you involved. The
character progression was fun to build up skills. But the real
thing that kept me interested in the game was the awesome story
and characters. I guess I really mean characters, because the plot
is pretty standard, but it really comes alive through the
characters. Even the world is mostly a nameless backdrop, although
there are quite a few cool details&#8212;like the different scripts
used by the different countries, the common architectural styles,
etc. The characters themselves are, in part, great because of
their connections (often familial) with each other and their
growth (particular Jansen.) I highly recommend the game for
that.</p>

<p>In a word, I&#8217;d call the game &#8220;meaningful&#8221;. There&#8217;s a big
message and it is communicated very effectively. There were many
strong emotional pulls and every time there was tragedy for the
characters, you had been prepared to care, so that it was tragedy
for you too. (Especially with the ending.) The epilogue is very
nice as well, I really like the new outfits too.</p>

<p>One final thing: I found the final battle disappointing in a
strange way. In the first part of the battle, I felt good because
I was doing huge amounts of damage, but it was also difficult
because I had to careful plan my actions. I felt powerful, but it
was not easy. In the second part though, it was a lot
different. Very quickly, basically all the characters except Kaim
were killed and every round was a single attack from Kaim for less
than a thousand damage and then healing for everyone else. Some
rounds Kaim wouldn&#8217;t be able to attack. Eventually I just stopped
keeping some of the characters alive because they weren&#8217;t really
contributing. After over an hour of this, I won with Kaim and Seth
left standing, Seth using a healing item every round and Kaim
doing a dinky attack. On one hand, I should feel proud and happy
that I was able to do it with few resources and at the bare edge
of survival, but on the other it felt really unsatisfying to win
in such a simple, weak way.</p>

<time datetime="2011-01-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jan</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2011</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Game Dev Story for iOS was on sale and I bought it. (The first
game I&#8217;ve ever bought for the iPhone for myself. (I bought my wife a
puzzle game.))</p>

<p>In this game, you simulate managing a video game company. You
hire staff (first 4, then 6, then 8) and pick what games you&#8217;ll
make. You control the genre and theme of the game. There are a
wide variety of very funny combinations. (One of my most
successful games was a &#8220;Poncho&#8221; themed Action RPG.) You then
choose which of your staff will be in charge of the game, its
graphics, and sound. You can improve staff by leveling them up
with points or by training them. Training could be giving them
vacations, or sending them to college, or sending them to read
manga. (Trainings unlock more genres. For example, when you send a
coder on a long trip, they learn about the Poncho genre.) You can
advertise through a variety of means (I like Lunar Writing.) It&#8217;s
really funny.</p>

<p>When I first started playing this game, it was super crack. It
is very satisfying to see the numbers go up and to hear the fire
noises and all that fun stuff. I like to see my profits and sales
go up, etc. However, the game gets pretty boring once you get all
the best staff and get into a rhythm. For me, that happen around
year 11 (there are 20 years in the game, each takes about 30
minutes I&#8217;d guess) when I hired all the &#8220;hackers&#8221; and started my
sequence of making a new game with high popularity and a good
combination, then a sequel, then back and forth. After that time,
every game was rated about 35 (out of 40) and I made millions. I
ended the game after making 67 games, selling 552,575,044 units,
and with $892,280.9K in the bank. My highest selling game was Dr
Bomboo with total sales of 31,708,001 units. Dr Bomboo was the
third in a series of robot-themed shooters. The name of my company
was &#8220;Get Bonus&#8221;.</p>

<p>Overall, the game wasn&#8217;t deep enough for its length, but the
first half was too much fun.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played through WarioWare: Touched! and had a chance with all of
the games. It is really fun, just like /WarioWare: Smooth Moves/
for the Wii.</p>

<p>This is the perfect game for someone with ADD, especially once
you unlock the Megamix and can sit on one screen and go through
the whole variety of games. I really enjoyed the retro games, but
I was a little annoyed when the control was really different than
the original game, because I felt stupid being so bad at them
initially. I thought the mic-based games were all very lazy and
easily the worst part of the game. my wife and I played the
Ping-Pong game, which was an incredibly clever use of the dual
screens of the DS.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot; I&#8217;ll keep it around to play
whenever I need something quick to fool around with.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the
DS. I&#8217;d never played a game in this series before and it&#8217;s been a
long time since I&#8217;ve played a tactical game like this&#8212;although
/Devil Survivor/ was definitely tactically-inspired.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the game. I especially liked how hard it
felt. I think I only lost two or three missions (but beat them on
the second try), but for nearly all the missions after the
tutorial levels, I felt pushed to my limit and nearly losing. I
like that sensation, because it keeps the game very exciting.</p>

<p>During the majority of the time I played the game, I would make my
moves for a round, and then I would go do something else (like
practicing Japanese) and then look back when it was my turn
again. It was amazing to me how long it would often take before I
could take a turn again. I consider this a problem with the game,
although it worked out for good in my case because I was glad to
be getting something else done as well without giving it my total
focus.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about the game was how by the end, I
was regularly using almost all the features of the combat. This
suggests to me that the mechanics are well-designed and actually
useful.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/12/16/Game--Mario-and-Luigi--Partners-in-Time--DS--2005--0/">Game: Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time (DS, 2005)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-12-16T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time for the DS.</p>

<p>Ever since Super Mario RPG, I&#8217;ve liked the idea of a Mario-based
RPG, especially because of the action-based combat. I played Super
Paper Mario when I first got a Wii and enjoyed it a lot, but I
hadn&#8217;t played any of the portable Mario and Luigi games. I heard a
lot of good things about Bowser&#8217;s Inside Story, so I decided to
play this game in preparation.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable, but with a few
big flaws.</p>

<p>First, the dialogue is hilarious and ridiculous. There were many
times when I stopped, found my wife, and told her some of the great
lines. Second, the battle system was initially extremely
fun. Fighting each different enemy actually /feels/ different, as
opposed to a traditional turn-based RPG where you may use
different strategies, but what you&#8217;re doing feels the same. I&#8217;m
very impressed that they were able to do that.</p>

<p>I was not excellent at avoiding the enemies&#8217; attacks (you can
counter or dodge basically every attack against you), so I got
hammered a lot. This made me notice that average monsters would do
damage equal to about a third of your total health on every
attack. Since the players are normally out-numbered, this meant
that you could be KO&#8217;d in a single round on almost every battle if
you didn&#8217;t dodge. I don&#8217;t think I was under-leveled, because I was
able to get so far in the game. This was really obnoxious to me,
because I didn&#8217;t feel it fit the light-hearted tone of the game
and there were not very good ways to practice. (For example, it
takes about 2 minutes to get back into a fight after dying,
quitting, loading, etc; and I never found any &#8220;Heart Blocks&#8221; next
to a field where monsters were.)</p>

<p>A related problem was that it seemed like monsters had
extremely high health counters. For example, near when I quit, I
would regularly fight groups of 4 or 5 monsters, each with 170 HP
and I was able to do about 31 HP of damage each round with each
character. Each battle took almost 13 rounds&#8212;and that&#8217;s only if
I was able to dodge every attack and not have to heal. I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m that bad at games, so I find it easier to blame the
game.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is probably that after about 6 or 7
hours, I got really tired of the incredibly long and frustrating
battles, so I tried to avoid them as much as possible. I&#8212;as a
hardened RPG player&#8212;should have known better. If you avoid
combat, then you won&#8217;t level as much, so you won&#8217;t be able to
compete against bosses and other enemies, which spawns more
dodging, but now for necessity, etc. This was a bad strategy
because it really exacerbated my dislike of the game.</p>

<p>If I design a game with experience like this, I will have to
make a point of ensuring that the player cannot dig themselves
into a hole like this. One technique is to use a field-enemy
system like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy XIII where generally
enemies can only be avoided in &#8220;traversal&#8221; segments rather than
&#8220;dungeon&#8221; segments; and then control the pacing of combat through
that means.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I had a particularly horrendous battle. I fought B&amp;BB
(no spoilers). I started playing at the beginning of my student&#8217;s
final that started at 11am and got to the fight in about 15
minutes (not sure exactly.) The final was three hours and one
student made use of all the time. I beat the battle at 1:45pm. I
was in the battle for almost two hours! I couldn&#8217;t believe it!
This is supposed to a /portable/ game, as well. (You also cannot
pause in battle, which I find very odd.)</p>

<p>Last night, I was 12 hours into the game, at level 18, at the
fifth to last boss (according to a walkthrough), and getting
unbelievably pummeled. I decided that life is too short to play
games I don&#8217;t love. I walked away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still going to play Inside Story, but I probably will not
come back to this game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just beat N+ for the DS.</p>

<p>Death stats in row-column order: 0, 37, 156, 443, 0, 110, 54, 2054
(bombs), 4 (clock), 4, 231, 134 (falling); Total: 3223.</p>

<p>Gold: 20323</p>

<p>This is an amazing 2D platforming game. It requires a lot of
precision and skill. I played it when I first got my DS, but
didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time on it (in fact, I don&#8217;t think I beat
the first episode.) But, I was reminded of it by Podcast 198x when
they compared it to Super Meat Boy, which I just got on XBLA. So,
since I&#8217;m DS-bound, I decided to play it.</p>

<p>I beat all the episodes and all the levels (I think there&#8217;s
about 250.) The satisfaction I get from this game is shmup like:
you have an incredibly difficult challenge that you tackle bit by
bit&#8212;getting a little bit further in the level each time. It&#8217;s a
great feeling to defeat something so difficult.</p>

<p>The game is incredibly exhilarating too. For example, there are
sentries that target you with their lasers and fire. You can see
the cross-hair starting to follow you and lock-on (it turns red
when it does); my heart races when I am avoiding laser
fire. Similarly, there are heat-seeking missiles that get on your
tail and it is a blast to avoid them.</p>

<p>The game is more physics-based than most platformers I&#8217;ve
played. A lot of levels require a certain amount of momentum to
get passed segments; gravity is actually acceleration rather than
velocity; etc. This makes an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>The game has perfect control. I can&#8217;t think of anything that
could be better about it.</p>

<p>I think the only thing the game lacks is kickin music. I know
there was music, but it is totally forgetable.</p>

<p>Overall, amazing game: A+</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a video that gives a good taste of the game and one of the
hardest levels: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYVr3GpBIHM">Episode 38</a>.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Since the flood, I haven&#8217;t been able to play my normal game
regime. I decided to play a DS game, since that still works. I
picked up Nostalgia.</p>

<p>This game is great. It is basically Indiana Jones the RPG. The
alternate history world is really fun. The battle system is
straight-forward and classic, but still fun. The skill system is
interesting, although I didn&#8217;t find it that necessary to actually
use the skills much. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot.</p>

<p>The main problem is that after 12 hours, I had to stop because
I hit a well-known glitch in the game that stops your
progression. I read a few people on forums talking about the
problem and having to return the game, etc. Very disappointing,
but it was a fun experience while it lasted.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>On the plane ride back from New England for Thanksgiving, I beat
New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I started playing the game in August 2009 on a trip to Oregon
for a wedding, but I hit a wall in my progress after the second
tower in World 6. It was very frustrating, so I only played it
occasionally (less than monthly), basically whenever I was bored
and had a few moments. On the ride out to Boston this year, I did
exactly that. And again as I was sitting around with my family one
night. Then. I beat the level! I played regularly the rest of the
trip and by the flight home, I&#8217;d beaten it.</p>

<p>Most of my opinion of the game revolve around the last World
and my painful experience with the progress wall. Obviously it is
very frustrating not to make any progress. I think the biggest
problem was that even when I could beat a level, you are
restricted from saving until after a tower or castle, so you had
to have a successful string and a long time to play to make
progress. NSMBW solved this problem with the Quick Save system,
although I see no reason to not have Save anywhere unlocked from
the beginning. The final level&#8217;s maze was really frustrating&#8212;I
made it there over 10 times and tried different patterns over and
over again, running out of time and then lives each time, before
looking it up online (which was a miracle, because I was on a
plane.)</p>

<p>I thought the physics in the game after more off than NSMBW. I
thought that the additional power-ups were mostly all dumb.</p>

<p>But, I love platformers and Mario in particular, so it was
really fun, especially when you&#8217;re on a roll.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/22/Game--Muramasa--The-Demon-Blade--Wii--2009--0/">Game: Muramasa: The Demon Blade (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-22T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe how good this game is. It is stunningly
beautiful. The gameplay is really fun and never gets old. The
story is unique. Wow, just wow.</p>

<p>A few things I really loved:
- The backgrounds are DEEP and many layered. I loved walking
through a forest and seeing the shaded groves in the back. I
loved walking through the countryside and seeing houses in the
background. The detail is just exceptional.
- I love the interaction with the environment during battle. For
example, you&#8217;ll be fighting in a bamboo forest, and when you
attack you will cut bamboo shoots and they&#8217;ll fall down. It is a
really subtle effect, but it feels and looks great when it
happens.
- I love the art on the food that the characters eat and the
animation of bites being taken out of it. Again, it is a very
subtle and funny thing to see, but I liked it so much I went out
of my way to eat everything so I could see what it looked
like. It made me hungry for Japanese food.
- I enjoy that the characters can hang out a hot spring to get
rejuvenated. It is especially funny when they run into a spirit,
a monkey, or the other character while they&#8217;re there, because
there&#8217;s always funny dialogue.
- I like that both stories revolve around a woman: Momohime is the
central character of her story, although the possessing spirit
is also important; Kisuke is not really the central character in
his, instead Torahime is.
- I /really/ like how the characters talk trash against enemies in
the dialogue sequences before they fight them. It is really
funny and the style of their trash talk is really unique too.</p>

<p>A few things I thought could be better:
- It was a pain to see how many souls you&#8217;d collected, because it
was on the Start menu or the main screen. It was a few clicks
away.
- The animation getting out of battle was a little slow and didn&#8217;t
kick in until all the souls had floated to you. So there were
quite a few times when I was traveling a far distance and was
annoyed that I had to wait so long to move again.
- It was annoying to keep track of which Enemy Lairs you&#8217;d
defeated, because there was not &#8220;Todo list&#8221; and they looked the
same on the map before and after you&#8217;d completed them (although
not before and after you&#8217;d unlocked them, but you don&#8217;t find out
the level recommendation until you&#8217;d unlocked them.)</p>

<p>One way you can tell how much I liked the game was my desire to
complete /everything/. The game has two characters and
three endings per character. Here are my stats for my
playthroughs:
- Momohime: 1st ending: 7 hours, 32 minutes; Level 47
- Kisuke: 1st ending: 5 hours, 40 minutes; Level 41
- Momohime: 2nd ending: 11 hours, 51 minutes; Level 92
- Kisuke: 2nd ending: 6 hours, 27 minutes; Level 49
- Momohime: 3rd ending: 13 hours, 20 minutes; Level 99
- Kisuke: 3rd ending: 9 hours, 5 minutes; Level 86</p>

<p>I really liked the game and highly recommend it.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/08/Game--Dragon-Quest-9--DS--2010--0/">Game: Dragon Quest 9 (DS, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-08T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>08</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through Dragon Quest IX on my Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I played the first Dragon Warrior game when I was young and
watched a good friend of mine play through the other NES
games. Shortly before my house burned down, if I remember
correctly, I bought a PS2 Dragon Quest, but I never finished it
due to that. So, this is my first Dragon Quest game in a lonoong
time.</p>

<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t finish this game either. I got to the very
last battle and was totally creamed. The disparity between the
second to last battle and the last battle was quite amazing&#8212;I
think I died in one round in the last battle. Obviously I could
have just grinded some more to give myself a chance and do it, but
at that point the &#8220;Time = Progress&#8221; equation of JRPGs was too
apparent to me and it wasn&#8217;t worth it to continue. I explored a
few grottos, decided I wasn&#8217;t going to finish the game, and
watched the ending on YouTube.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the game was pretty fun. The partner AI worked
really well, and was actually broken in a way: the AI could change
its commands based on what occurred earlier in the round, whereas
you as a player are not able to do that. The battles were pretty
difficult most of the time, which I enjoyed. The battle animations
were interesting for the first bit, but then they got really
tiring and I would just do sit-ups or something in between
rounds. Very boring.</p>

<p>The character progression system was fun&#8212;on the surface&#8212;it
was fun to allocate points and think about being different
classes. However, I made a lot of long run choices in my skill
allocation, despite not playing for the long-run, so I pretty much
ended the game with each character having one maxed weapon and
about 20/30 points in shield and 20/30 points in some other
skills. There was a period right before the end of the game when I
switched everyone&#8217;s class and got to about 20th level with
everyone, but it was really tedious and not as exciting as I
hoped. I think if I really loved the game, then I would enjoy
leveling through each class, but as it is, I didn&#8217;t love it enough
to really get into that.</p>

<p>I pretty much ignored the &#8220;quests&#8221; because after doing a few
the rewards were not very enticing and they were all painful to
contemplate. I didn&#8217;t do any treasure maps before the end of the
game and did two after. Again, if I loved the game, I would like
the ability to go and fight tougher monsters, but since I don&#8217;t
love the game, I&#8217;m not taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>I think if I knew people who wanted to play the game with me,
then I would have enjoyed continuing to play and experience those
other features, but they aren&#8217;t really for the solo player I
typically am.</p>

<p>The other way it could have won me, I think, was if leveling
was easier, because then it would provide less tedium to
experience the full range of the character options. I&#8217;ve briefly
read online about milking metal slimes, but that sounds a bit much
for my taste.</p>

<p>Another area where I probably ruined the game for myself was
acquiring gold. I read about a technique to make profit with
alchemy and I spent a few hours getting an enormous amount of
money so I could buy whatever I wanted. That was really boring and
didn&#8217;t really pay of either.</p>

<p>On areas other than mechanics, the game was really great.</p>

<p>I love the graphical style. It is pretty and it works really
well on the DS. I love how reactive a character&#8217;s appearance is to
your equipment. I love the clever puns and enemy names. The story
is very cute and I love that each locale has its own personality
that you get into as you explore it. The plot is interesting and
the high-level concept of the world is also neat. It&#8217;s funny how
close it goes to the JRPG cliché of fighting God, but skirts away
at the last minute. The music was fun.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t regret playing the game and I liked it a
lot. I can think of lots of ways it would have been better for me
personally, but I think it is perfectly fine for it to not be that
game, because I know how successful it was in Japan and how great
the other features are. I&#8217;ll definitely play Dragon Quest
X.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/03/Game--Sin---Punishment--Star-Successor--Wii--2010--1/">Game: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor (Wii, 2010) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-11-03T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Nov</span> <span class='day'>03</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Since I bought Sin &amp; Punishment 2, I haven&#8217;t played it
commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.</p>

<p>Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I&#8217;ve completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&amp;Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. I&#8217;ve 1CC&#8217;d every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.</p>

<p>Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&amp;Kachi. So rad.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve been playing again, I&#8217;ve thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I&#8217;ve thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.</p>

<p>It is a really remarkable game.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/26/Game--Final-Fantasy-4--SNES--1991--0/">Game: Final Fantasy 4 (SNES, 1991)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>This month I played through Final Fantasy
IV on the Super Nintendo using the Japanese release and the J2e
translation.</p>

<p>I remember loving FF4 when I was younger, but I haven&#8217;t played
it in a very long time. Back then, I remember hearing that the
Japanese version had more story scenes and a slightly different
story, due to the censorship Nintendo had at that point on the
SNES. Therefore, I was very excited to play a translation of the
Japanese version.</p>

<p>The new story is different in some subtle ways; the main change is
that there is a lot of risque humour, especially with Edge and
Palom. J2e kept &#8220;You Spoony Bard!&#8221;, which was great to
remember. Most of the spells and items seemed to be named
differently, and something else I liked a lot was that there
seemed to be no limit put on item and character name lengths,
which made for some more pleasant reading.</p>

<p>Overall, FF4 is as good as I remember. The story is
entertaining and detailed enough, for the time. The battle system
is fun&#8230; and actually it is much more brutal than I
remembered. The non-boss battles were particularly rough rather
than the normal steam-rolling fodder. The optional content is very
detailed. The characters are interesting. A subtle thing I really
enjoy is that there is no character customization: by level 38,
Rosa always learns Reflect, with no options. This kind of thing is
no longer popular, but I liked the way it ties together the
character&#8217;s personality and their battle powers. (For example,
when Rydia is encouraged by Rosa to cast a Fire spell&#8212;despite
her village being destroyed by fire&#8212;she then gains the ability
in combat as well.) Despite appearances, it actually gives you
more ability to be creative, because you have to find interesting
ways to use the abilities that you have, rather than find a boring
min-max strategy.</p>

<p>I misremembered the story a little bit, so I was pleasantly
surprised. For example, I thought that Edge would die near the end
and that FuSoYa would be in the party for the rest of the game,
but I was (obviously) wrong.</p>

<p>Definitely a great game, I think I will enjoy playing it again
in another few years.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up Deathsmiles on the release date, and I&#8217;ve been playing
it every day since. Today, I&#8217;ve decided I will be putting it on my
&#8220;play once a month&#8221; rotation, rather than my &#8220;play once a day&#8221;
rotation. The occasion: 1CCs.</p>

<p>I cleared Xbox 360 mode with Rosa a while back finishing with
67,814,085 points. At the time, I was #54 out of the other Rosa
players in the same mode.</p>

<p>For a while, I worked on clearing with Casper, but only managed
to get to the second castle stage (not to the final boss) with
45,286,742 points and #29 out of Casper players. After hitting a
wall, I decided I didn&#8217;t need to clear with every character right
now and I&#8217;d rather try another mode.</p>

<p>This morning, I cleared Mega Black Label Xbox 360 mode with
Rosa with 249,250,914 points. I was #7 out of Rosa players and #26
out of all players. Yum!</p>

<p>Deathsmiles is a very cool game. I really enjoyed the last few
months of intense play and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll enjoy picking it up every
once in a while.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/16/Lost-0/">Lost</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-16T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Starting in July, <em>REDACTED</em> and I started watching Lost. Since it had
finished, we were able to watch all the episodes with only the
delays we wanted, rather than having to wait in between
seasons&#8212;the way we like it.</p>

<p>My first experience with Lost was when I went to the graduate
school recruiting visit. Someone invited a few of us over to watch
the third or fourth episode. I wasn&#8217;t really interested at the
time, but when I think of Lost, I think of that first. I&#8217;m guessing
I would&#8217;ve been caught if I had started back then. =)</p>

<p>I liked Lost because of the interesting mythology and the detailed
characters. Lost isn&#8217;t really about the &#8220;plot&#8221; or about discovering
a &#8220;mystery&#8221;, it is really a character drama where the situations in
the show just serve to illustrate the personalities of the
characters. Of course, this standard of the drama genre gets
co-opted by the mythology to turn the whole island experience into
a kind of test for the characters. The mythology as a whole is
really interesting and fun to speculate about. Yet I wouldn&#8217;t say
that discovering it is really what the show is about, because I
don&#8217;t believe the full mythology was in the mind of the creators,
thus you can&#8217;t really call it a &#8220;mystery&#8221;, but rather an unfolding
revelation.</p>

<p>My favourite characters where Juliette, Richard, Ben, and the
Monster. Of the survivors, I thought <em>REDACTED</em> was very well developed
and Sawyer showed the most growth, which is interesting. I liked
Annalucia and Boone, though they were short lived, so they are
harder to appreciate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d definitely recommend Lost. I&#8217;m excited to read fan theories and
summaries now.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/10/13/Game--A-Boy-and-His-Blob--Wii--2009--0/">Game: A Boy and His Blob (Wii, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-10-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Oct</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played through A Boy and His Blob for the Wii. I&#8217;d been
watching this game since it was announced because it was 2D,
looked beautiful, and looked really cute too.</p>

<p>When I first started playing, I was very thorough: getting
every treasure and going through every challenge level, but
eventually (as you read below) the challenge levels became
incredibly painful and I started to hate the game because of
them. After that I just raced through the game and didn&#8217;t even get
many chests in the final world.</p>

<h1>Things I loved</h1>

<p>The 2D graphics are really pretty. I like the brightness and
the fluidity of them in particular. I like that the levels reflect
what the world map implies about them and sometimes you can see
the later landmarks on the map from inside them.  For example,
seeing the tower from the middle of the final world was epic.</p>

<p>The whole style is incredibly cute and heartwarming. The boy is
the best five year old I&#8217;ve ever seen in a game and I love the hug
animation. Even the enemies are kind of pudgy and cute.</p>

<p>The vast variety of beans is very entertaining. Only a few of
them overlap in functionality, so the puzzles are not necessarily
&#8220;non-linear&#8221;, but the variety of different kinds of puzzles keeps
it fresh. I would&#8217;ve liked a mode where I could play a level with
a custom selection of beans (perhaps after I beat it or got all
the chests.)</p>

<p>The puzzles are clever enough. There are a few places where you
can really break things with creativity, but that is fun. For
example, you can get birds to hit mine blobs and just walk out of
some otherwise difficult things; the Zorb bean can survive any
fall and is invulnerable, so you can just jump in it and then jump
off a cliff rather than blob-achute down. I think the final areas
(in the castles) had the best puzzles in terms of difficulty and
interestingatude.</p>

<p>I was very surprised when I got to the first boss battle. I
thought the worked really well as multi-part puzzles. Although,
I&#8217;ll complain about them more later&#8230; that they exist is
definitely a plus.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the lack of text and the way the game
communicated to you what you were supposed to do and the
intentions of the blob, etc. This is best illustrated by the lack
of a menu. I love that you turn the game on and are almost
instantly controlling the boy.</p>

<p>MECHA BLOB!</p>

<h1>Things I hated</h1>

<p>Although the puzzles were clever and interesting, there was not
enough mystery because almost every stage has a sign instructing
you which of the four beans is the correct one to use for that
segment. This really kills a lot of the enjoyment, because you&#8217;re
not so much &#8220;solving the puzzle&#8221; as &#8220;executing the solution&#8221;. I
will complain below about the tools you have for &#8220;executing&#8221;, so
this turns out to be a big problem.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the game, the challenge levels don&#8217;t have
checkpoints. This makes playing them really jarring because it
doesn&#8217;t fit with the general feel. Since the challenge levels have
the hardest &#8220;reflex&#8221; challenges (more below), this is particularly
annoying. Some of the challenge levels are just stupid-cheap
too. For example, I quit playing them after one where you had to
drop a Trampobean down a pit and then jump hoping you landed on it
correctly. You then had to do this four more times, restarting
from the beginning when you missed. Since the beans bounce and
have physics applied to them, it is frustrating and unsatisfying
to make the jump correctly.</p>

<p>There are a few annoying bugs. Level 4-1 sticks in my mind
because you don&#8217;t have the blob with you, so he doesn&#8217;t eat the
chests. Instead, you drop them into the ground level where the
blob will get them later. I dropped every chest and made it to the
next checkpoint, yet only two chests were there at the
end. Arggh.</p>

<h1>The biggest most &#8220;shoot myself in the face&#8221; problem</h1>

<p>The controls are unimaginably bad. They are sluggish and
inaccurate. It is like trying to push an anvil with a wet
noodle. I&#8217;ve read the developers talk about how this is partly
because the boy is supposed to be a clumsy kid but that seems like
a total cop-out. This just plain sucks. I think the sluggish-ness
would not be as bad if you could use the D-pad to control the boy,
but even on the Classic controller (where most buttons duplicate
what another button does), you cannot. This is especially dumb
because the game is 2D.</p>

<p>In general, this horrible control would be much more passable
if the game did not require reflexes. Yet, there are many reflex
sections that require exact platforming control yet the mechanics
do not give the ability to do it. I don&#8217;t mind restarting levels,
etc (I play shmups after all), but that&#8217;s because the games I play
that require that always make clear that it is /your fault/
when you die and it never feels like the game&#8217;s fault. I can
honestly say that almost all the time, I felt like I was dying
because the controls were so bad. There is nothing more
frustrating than this.</p>

<p>The bad controls are made worse by some of the custom bean
controls. The Zorb, Rocket, and Bouncer are the biggest offenders,
because they are the most mobile beans. The Blobachute is bad
too.</p>

<p>This problem is why the challenge levels were so bad. They were
almost all reflex based and had a higher than normal restart
penalty. The bosses were frustrating for the same reason. The
third boss was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I
wanted to blow my brains out. Ugh.</p>

<h1>The verdict</h1>

<p>This is a good game, but not a classic. I only want to play
classics. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be playing this much more, but if I
have a young friend in the near future I may point them at this or
donate the game to them.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/26/Game--Etrian-Odyssey--DS--2007--0/">Game: Etrian Odyssey (DS, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-26T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>When I went to visit my parents, I started playing Etrian Odyssey
based on a discussion on Active Time Babble.</p>

<p>I was able to get to the 20th floor. I had 34k in money with
nothing to buy at the time. I completed every quest that was
available. My party was: Landsknecht (57), Protector (57), Samurai
(53), Medic (57), and an Alchemist (57).</p>

<h1>Things I liked</h1>

<p>I like mapping. It is really satisfying to enter an empty
screen and slowly fill in all the corners and corridors on your
map.</p>

<p>I like the art style.</p>

<p>I like the combat. Since the game is entirely combat
(seriously, the story in its entirety is: &#8220;There is a dungeon
outside the town.&#8221;), it&#8217;s natural that it will be fun and
complex. It wasn&#8217;t often that I could &#8220;phone it in&#8221; and just slam
A. The way that attacks would build on each and the way that the
Protector class worked were particularly cool.</p>

<p>I like the grind. By my definition, an analogy for good grinding
is when there is a wall, you know how to get over it, but you&#8217;re
not quite ready to jump it yet, so you need to practice jumping
slightly smaller walls. In the context of the game, the wall is a
boss or the normal monsters on the next level of the dungeon and
you simply can&#8217;t defeat them. The smaller walls are other monsters
that actually require some plan or strategy to defeat. (For
example, if you can just press A to defeat the next most difficult
monsters before the boss, then it is boring grinding, but if the
other fights will be difficult, than it is good grinding.) I think
I liked this game so much because it was almost entirely good
grinding. (In retrospect, Final Fantasy XIII did this really
well.)</p>

<p>I liked the flow of the game. Since there is no story, there is
no interruption from the action. This means that there is always
something to do and get better at. This really hits my pleasure
receptors. =)</p>

<h1>Things I didn&#8217;t like</h1>

<p>The mapping system isn&#8217;t advanced enough. There were many times
where I wanted to express something&#8212;like the link between a
portal&#8217;s entrance and exit, or the fact that a corridor/door was
one-way&#8212;where there was no way to do it. I could always encode
the property some way, but it was unsatisfying that someone else
wouldn&#8217;t be able to read my map. It was also annoying that there
is a limit to the number of certain elements on each map floor. In
one case, I had to use the trap symbol to indicate the absence of
a trap because there were so many.</p>

<p>The character customization didn&#8217;t have enough feedback on what
would be different in combat. This is particularly relevant, IMHO,
because you couldn&#8217;t upgrade everything (there just aren&#8217;t enough
levels.) But it was often the case that I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what
upgrading a skill would really do in practice.</p>

<p>I stopped playing because I got to a point where the difficulty
curve steepened drastically and I couldn&#8217;t bear the slog
through. Basically, it got to the point where the only grinding I
could do was boring grinding because I was too powerful for the
second worst enemy but not powerful enough to clear the worst

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/09/13/Game--Bayonetta--X360--2010--0/">Game: Bayonetta (X360, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-09-13T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Sep</span> <span class='day'>13</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Bayonetta for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>This game is insane. The craziness of the situations Bayonetta
is in is truly ridiculous. One of my favourite parts is when you
are falling out of an airplane&#8217;s cargo bay, so you stop time and
jump up the falling crates. Awesome. The fights are insane. The
climax finishes are equally ridiculous. The attention to detail is
really stellar too. The gameplay is intense. Oh man. This game is
great.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the soundtrack, especially the theme song and
the rendition of &#8220;Fly Me to the Moon&#8221;.</p>

<p>I played through on Normal, then Very Easy, then Easy, then
Hard (finished in under 3 hours), then Non-Stop Infinite Climax
(the hardest difficulty, crazy name huh?) (finished in 3 hours, 4
minutes.) I ended up playing the game for a total of 33 hours, 50
minutes, and 45 seconds. I unlocked everything (except Sai-Fon),
got almost all the achievements, tried out the extra characters,
etc. I didn&#8217;t like playing with the extra characters or the extra
costumes as much because the detail just wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>The main thing I disliked about the game was the
&#8220;mini-games&#8221;. For example, there is a shooting gallery game, a
racing level, and a Space Harrier-like level. These introduce
totally new control schemes and don&#8217;t have the polish of the
overall game. Unlike Treasure, who takes the same mechanics and
control and puts them in a different genre, Platinum Games just
implemented a whole other game and put it inside Bayonetta. I
especially dislike the Space Harrier level.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/09/09/10-video-games-that-should-be-comics/">description of Bayonetta</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t played it, Bayonetta is the story of<br/>a bespectacled witch who straps guns to her feet so that she can<br/>kick people in the face while she&#8217;s shooting them in the face at<br/>the same time, and the better she fights, the more naked she<br/>gets. Oh, and also, she kills angels with a zeal that makes her a<br/>pretty close equivalent to a sexy female version of Ronnie James<br/>Dio. In other words, she&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d get if you went back<br/>in time and told fourteen year-old me to imagine best thing<br/>ever.</p></blockquote>


<p>Finally, a little comment on the M rating. I generally don&#8217;t
play M rated games because I don&#8217;t want to see extreme violence,
hear nasty language, or see pornography. The violence in Bayonetta
doesn&#8217;t bother me because the enemies are so inhuman (and the
humans, including Bayonetta herself, bleed e.g. rose petals); for
the large grotesque monsters the blood and gore doesn&#8217;t even feel
like gore. It looks like they&#8217;re spewing lava or something. I
thought the language in Bayonetta was bad, especially one
particular character (the Italian stooge.) I was initially
impressed that Bayonetta herself never used bad language, but she
once says the F word. It sounds really out of character because
she&#8217;s normally so sophisticated. I didn&#8217;t like that and it&#8217;s one
reason I never watched cut-scenes after the first
play-through. Finally, the pornography side. In my opinion,
Bayonetta is actually quite tame compared to many modern
games. Bayonetta replaces titillating graphic nudity with a
general sexual tone and flashes of partial nudity. This playful
PG-13-ness makes me grin and laugh at the craziness, rather than
be offended. I&#8217;m sure others would disagree, but that&#8217;s how I
feel. It definitely doesn&#8217;t pass the &#8220;Would I want my 13 year old
son to play it?&#8221; test, but I wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed if my college age
child did.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was really impressed by this game. I recommend
it. Play with the volume low in the cutscenes or just skip (the
story is only good for its insanity) if your ears are like
mine.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/31/Game--New-Super-Mario-Brothers-Wii--Wii--2009--1/">Game: New Super Mario Brothers Wii (Wii, 2009) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-31T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>31</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>my wife bought me New Super Mario Brothers Wii for Christmas and
part of my gift was her willingness to play it with me.</p>

<p>We played it regularly for a few months, getting to World 4
with every star coin and secret exit, etc. We stopped for a few
months and then started up again. We completed the game in May;
actually technically my wife did because I died right before we
saved Princess Peach. During the second round of playing, we
didn&#8217;t stress about getting every single star coin, because it was
a little too frustrating, especially for my wife, to play the same
course repeatedly. Now that we&#8217;ve completed the game, we started
trying to go back for the star coins and complete World 9, but it
is losing its appeal, so I thought it was the right time to review
it.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the game. It is a true Mario game. The joy of
running through a course bouncing around is great. The power-ups
are really fun, although we were probably too careful about using
them on the world map. The star coins are a good fun challenge,
although I think they are a little annoying because there is often
only a single way to get them, and when that entails bringing a
power-up into a course, it is particularly annoying.</p>

<p>The graphics are just right. The music is incredibly cute. One
of my favourite touches in the game is how the monsters do a
little dance with the music every so often. The super play videos
are out of control awesome. (The biggest sadness of not having all
the star coins is not being able to watch all these great videos.)
The platforming is definitely innovative. The rotating surfaces,
the way light is used, the way you can interact with the
environment (World 5-4 really stands out), etc. I&#8217;m a major
opponent of innovation for innovation&#8217;s sake, but this innovation
really added to the fun of the game.</p>

<p>This game is FUN. I can&#8217;t wait to play with the <em>REDACTED</em> and his
sister (We haven&#8217;t decided on her pseudonym yet.)</p>

<time datetime="2010-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I got Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor the day after it came out
(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.</p>

<p>/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.</p>

<p>The best reviews of this game are&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the first draft of my review for Sin & Punishment: Star<br/>Successor in its entirety:</p><p>&#8220;YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&#8221;</p><p>While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of<br/>playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to<br/>explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even<br/>though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the<br/>same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back<br/>about playing Treasure&#8217;s latest game is kind of exciting. This is<br/>not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game<br/>to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL<br/>LETTERS.</p><p>[[http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/25/sin-and-punishment-star-successor-review/][Joystiq: Review: Sin & Punishment: Star Successor by JC Fletcher<br/>on Jun 25th 2010 10:02AM]]</p></blockquote>


<p>And&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a<br/>veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky<br/>frictions”.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and<br/>Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of<br/>straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the<br/>most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its<br/>second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and<br/>Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love<br/>the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a<br/>universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower<br/>under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire<br/>economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]<br/>happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much<br/>we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes<br/>for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time<br/>around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have<br/>our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on<br/>the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was<br/>sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though<br/>something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of<br/>the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line<br/>from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the<br/>“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a<br/>Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a<br/>flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a<br/>whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you<br/>ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting<br/>tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting<br/>stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the<br/>game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either<br/>way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the<br/>hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,<br/>whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict<br/>is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding<br/>maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the<br/>boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,<br/>“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive<br/>sound chip!”</p><p>[action button dot net: Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=623)</p></blockquote>


<p>The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.</p>

<p>The only problem with the game, for me, is that I&#8217;m a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can &#8220;Save &amp; Quit&#8221; without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won&#8217;t score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.</p>

<p>my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I&#8217;d like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I&#8217;ve seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don&#8217;t need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I&#8217;ve played with enjoy it and wouldn&#8217;t like it if they had to do
more.</p>

<time datetime="2010-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had Mushihime-sama Futari for the Xbox 360 for a while now so
I thought I&#8217;d comment on it more than my original post.</p>

<p>I am still enamored with the music and graphics. The bullet
patterns are great and it&#8217;s a blast to play. It has really
converted me to the CAVE-style shooter. I like the music so much,
in fact, that I listen to it a lot in the shower or in the morning
to pump me up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to express what I like about it. There&#8217;s so much
visual and aural stimulation. The popping noise of taking out an
enemy is satisfying. The barrage of bullets you produce and the
stream of gems you collect is mesmerizing. I think the best part
is slowly getting better and better and feel domination over
earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve been using Normal Reco exclusively. Here are my
accomplishments:
- Novice - Original - 1 life
- Novice - Maniac - 1 life
- Novice - Ultra - 1CC (twice)
- Arrange - Original - 1 CC
- Arrange - Maniac - 1 CC
- Arrange - Ultra - 1CC</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now working on 1CC-ing version 1.5. I&#8217;ve been able to get to
stage 4, but my high score was from a run when I got to stage 3
and ended with 55,306,397 points. At that time I was 2,239th on
the leaderboards. Ouch. I&#8217;ll get better though.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/07/29/Game--Deathsmiles--X360--2010--0/">Game: Deathsmiles (X360, 2010)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-07-29T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jul</span> <span class='day'>29</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Deathsmiles on the day it came after pre-ordering it from
Gamestop. The clerk at the store in Orem said that only he and I
had pre-ordered the game. I wonder how he likes it?</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it. It is really weird to play a
horizontally scrolling bullet hell game, but it works very
well. The back-and-forth between shooting to the left and the
right is very speedy. The CAVE style of bullets are easy to see,
although that doesn&#8217;t mean the patterns are easy to dodge. The
familiar system is interesting (you have an option rotating around
you that moves when you move depending on what kind of shot you
are using.) The scoring system is simple to understand yet
obviously intricate to master.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition came with an Xbox faceplate, which I used
just because, and an &#8220;arranged&#8221; soundtrack. [Aside, many Japanese
things come in an &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version. This seems to me &#8220;edited&#8221; or
&#8220;variant&#8221;, although in most cases the &#8220;Arrange&#8221; version of a
soundtrack means that it is done with normal instruments rather
than the original sound chip.] I don&#8217;t really like the arranged
soundtrack, although I do like the music in the game.</p>

<p>However, I definitely don&#8217;t like the game music as much as the
music in Mushihime-sama Futari, Ikaruga, or other shmups with
awesome soundtracks. I think the reason is that in many of those
games the music is simply /intense/ and matches the action of the
game really well. (Or, in the case of Treasure vertical shooters,
is simply epic and awe-inspiring.) In contrast, Deathsmiles&#8217; music
matches the /setting/ of the game and so it blends in more and is
less memorable or hype inducing.</p>

<p>As far as my accomplishments with the game so far: I&#8217;ve gotten
most of the Xbox achievements by credit-feeding and exploring the
game. I&#8217;m starting to work on my 1CC with Rosa. My best run was to
Tyrannosatan (the final boss) on one credit with a score of
41,697,576 points. At the time that put me at 107th place, on the
Rosa-specific leaderboard.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/27/Game--Ikaruga--X360--2008--4/">Game: Ikaruga (X360, 2008) (5)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-06-27T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>27</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post about Ikaruga, I&#8217;ve continued my daily
training. I&#8217;ve made a few new accomplishments:
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 2.</em> I&#8217;ve been working on this
since November 2009 and I finally did it this morning.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s (roughly) my technique ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sow_bw4iq4][here&#8217;s a video of someone doing
it much better than me]] to following along): chain the first few
popcorn strands and then dodge the kamikaze planes while getting
two to three more chains in the process, if I get hit then just
shot everything but try to end in a white enemy, then get the
six black enemies on the left, then get three white (not four!)
in the middle, then get the six white on the right, then go back
to the middle and get the black as they fly by, ending by
switching to black and firing lasers to destroy everything
remaining. By the end of the prologue, I&#8217;ve had a 12 chain
stretch and I&#8217;m on a 14 chain stretch. If I&#8217;m imbalanced because
I didn&#8217;t have enough laser energy for the whites, an immediate
bullet will kill a white and a quick second shot after moving to
the right a little will get another white. Now I kill the blacks
two at a time as they rotate around, then kill all the white. If
I&#8217;ve been fast enough, the ring of white will appear and I&#8217;ll
get them, then get all the floating white blocks. Now I destroy
the left black block on top, then the right, then I get the two
popcorn that come on the left, then go back and get the
right. By this time I should have a little more than 30
chains. Now I destroy the white blocks by firing then move
forward and blow black lasers to get the incoming whites. Now I
go back and forth chaining every single enemy, then I blast the
white stream of popcorn until I have to get out. I tap to the
left and switch black then kill the 3 black on the left, then
the 3 white on the right, then I get the rotating popcorn. I
ignore the laser shooting enemies and kill the six white popcorn
on the left, then three on right (I often die if I go for all
six so I play it safe.) Then I destroy the left 6 black and use
lasers to destroy the central blocks, now I chain everything
that comes through until I get to the popcorn emitters. I
destroy the black generators then start taking out white streams
until the bottom one is off-screen. Then I destroy the black
popcorn in the circle as the come past the bottom, then I blast
all the white and chain the laser-shooters and their
options. Now it&#8217;s time for the boss and I&#8217;ve got almost 90
chains. I take down the boss by shooting black lasers
immediately, opening the white hatch, destroying it, opening the
black hatch, then sitting right next to it dodging. I can take
down the boss in about 15 seconds and only opening the hatches
once each.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing down my strategy so that you can learn or
because it&#8217;s that important, but I&#8217;d like you to understand that
I have the entire level in my brain and I have planned out my
attack to the letter.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Easy - Chapter 4 - Dot Eater.</em> This took about five weeks of
playing (but, of course, for two I was on a trip so I caught up
on a single night last week.) I wouldn&#8217;t say it was much easier
than Chapter 3, but rather doing Chapter 3 taught me so much
about Ikaruga that I was able to do it easier. Chapter 4 is
probably a little bit easier though because it has such a strong
theme: oppositely spinning beams of black and white so you must
be one color to go one direction and the other to go the
opposite. One thing I&#8217;m a bit proud of is that I got through the
boss on my first try ever and didn&#8217;t get hit once (which is good
because I didn&#8217;t have any extra lives by the time I go to the
boss.) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PlVm5n0zk">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I still love this game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played Soma Bringer for the DS. At
first, I thought I would love it because it felt like Secret of
Mana. After playing through five &#8220;acts&#8221; of the game, I became too
bored with it and stopped playing.</p>

<p>I played as Millers with the Kampfs class and used claws as my
weapon.</p>

<p>Although on the surface, it is like /Secret of Mana/, there is
very little choice or customization in the battle system. There
are eight characters, but you can only play as one and have two
others for back-up. (Since only one character, it seems, can heal,
you pretty much must have them in the party.)  When your choose
your character, you can pick any of six classes, but each
character is best suited for one class. Each class can use about
three different kinds of weapons, but if you don&#8217;t invest
everything in one kind of weapon, you&#8217;ll be disadvantaged. Next,
you can choose to invest skill points in weapon-specific special
attacks. (If I recall there are about eight options, but they open
up in a staggered way.) For Kampfs, each special attack is
specified as either Combo 1, 2, or 3. You get bonuses for using
the combo attacks in sequence. What this all amounts to is that
once you decide your class and preferred weapon, everything is
determined for the rest of the game, because you want one of each
combo and the strongest version of it.</p>

<p>The game is too easy too. You get way to much money and can buy
whatever you want. Of course, there is rarely anything you&#8217;d want
to buy, so it just accumulates.</p>

<p>The story is interesting but there isn&#8217;t anything too special
about it.</p>

<p>The game has a multi-player mode that I imagine would be fun,
but I didn&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Overall, I can recommend the first third of the game, but
during the second third I was hoping that something new and
interesting would happen; when it didn&#8217;t I quit.</p>

<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Devil Survivor in December 2009 and played it
regularly until the middle of January, then I got stuck on one
fight, so I played twice a week to progress without being numbed
by grinding. After I got through the battle in March, things
picked up and I played it regularly again. I&#8217;ve decided to stop
playing because I&#8217;ve been grinding to get past a battle for almost
two months with no end in sight.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great: it&#8217;s a turn-based tactical role-playing
game with Dragon Quest-style fights when combatants encounter each
other on the field. I find real-time strategy games too frantic,
so I really enjoyed this system. There is a Pokemon-esque
&#8220;catch-them-all&#8221; with the demons that you can collect (apparently
this is common with all Megaten games, but it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve
ever played.) There is incredibly deep customization with the
demon skills you can &#8220;crack&#8221;.</p>

<p>The game got a lot easier for me once I understood how to use
all its systems. For the majority of the time I played, I didn&#8217;t
realize what the fusion search option did. (It shows you all the
demons that you can potentially get by combining demons you have.)
Instead, I would search through combinations manually. Since that
was so tedious, I almost never did it. Once I understood search, I
did lots more fusing. Similarly, I didn&#8217;t realize that you could
change a character&#8217;s skills whenever you wanted. I thought you had
to crack them from an enemy and then you had that skill until it
was replaced. Once I realized that wasn&#8217;t the case, I could tailor
my characters much better for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>The game is very skillful. Almost no battle will have a random
outcome if you plan your skill and demon configuration properly. I
really appreciate that.</p>

<p>However, there are a few key points where if you&#8217;ve done every
single battle before them and you&#8217;ve cracked every skill by doing
the free battles many times, you won&#8217;t be high enough level to
beat the battle. So, your only option is to grind the free
battles. Unfortunately, grinding is extremely unproductive because
(1) a character on the field only gets EXP from the small battles
they participate in (rather than all the battles), (2) small
battles give minuscule amounts of EXP, and (3) free battles do not
give event EXP, which is typically very large. As an example, it
takes me about ten five to six minute battles to gain one level
for the Hero. The worst part is that there is typically only one
free battle available and it is almost exactly the same every time
you play it. Thus, you are not only grinding, which is boring, but
you are making the exact same moves every turn. I cannot fully
express how boring this is.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this game and feel bad that I am giving
up, but it is a little too willing to waste my time.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/22/Game--Retro-Game-Challenge--DS--2009--0/">Game: Retro Game Challenge (DS, 2009)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my tour, I played through most of Retro Game
Challenge and just completed the last challenge (beat all the
games) tonight. This game is incredibly brilliant.</p>

<p>The premise is that a demon version of a Japanese video game
playing TV star has sent you back into the 80s to challenge you
with old Famicom-style video games. You are presented with a game
and four challenges, when you complete most challenges you get a
new issue of a game magazine and when you complete all of them you
get another game and more challenges. Each game has an illustrated
manual. The game magazines are hilarious, because they will
preview games that you&#8217;ll be unlocking soon, they&#8217;ll report that a
game has been delayed, and they have a top 5 chart with hilarious
parody titles. When you play a game, it runs in to the top screen
of the DS, while on the bottom you see two kids sitting in front
of a TV playing. I love that the friend makes comments about how
you&#8217;re playing as you do. It is hilarious.</p>

<p>The games are great too:
- <em>Cosmic Gate</em> - This is a Galaga-like fixed-screen shooter. It
is simple, but fun.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man</em> - This is a single screen platformer,
like Bubble Bobble, although you throw ninja stars to stun
things. The main mechanic is going in &#8220;doors&#8221; that hurt the
enemies and protect you from damage. This isn&#8217;t my favourite
game, but it is enjoyable.
- <em>Rally King</em> - A racing game like RC Pro Am. The cool part is
the drift mechanic. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of racers, so when I beat
this game for the final challenge I used invincibility.
- <em>Star Prince</em> - A straight-forward vertically scrolling
shooter. The weapon selection is great and the hidden bonus
items are fun to find. You get a special controller to play this
game which turns your Y button into a rapid-fire. One of my
favourite subtleties is that you fire faster the closer you are
to the top of the screen (which is dangerous.)
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2</em> - This game plays just like its
predecessor, although it is considerably more difficult and the
final boss is very interesting.
- <em>Rally King SP</em> - The same game as its predecessor but with new
graphics. The levels are the same, etc. This is a promotional
game for the game magazine and a soup company. Very funny.
- <em>Guadia Quest</em> - A Dragon Quest-style JRPG. A fun mechanic is
that you can capture strong enemies and they will fight for
you. It was very fun to play this old school RPG.
- <em>Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3</em> - This is a reboot of the Robot Ninja
Haggle Man series with new graphics and gameplay. The gameplay
and graphics are incredibly reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden,
although the colors pop a lot more than the original NES Ninja
Gaidens. In addition to that core gameplay, there is a
customization system reminiscent of Super Metroid. This is a
little bit of exploration as well, but the levels are mostly
linear.</p>

<p>My favourite games were Star Prince, Robot Ninja Haggle Man 3, and
Guadia Quest.</p>

<p>I /highly/ recommend this one.</p>

<time datetime="2010-06-22T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Jun</span> <span class='day'>22</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I played the first few levels of Little Red Riding Hood&#8217;s Zombie
BBQ. It is a scrolling rail shooter-esque game. You control a sexy
anime Little Red Riding Hood in the bottom screen and can move
side-to-side with the D-pad. When you touch the screen you fire
your weapon in the direction of the touch&#8212;you control the
direction, not the target. If an enemy gets close, you can tap
your character to do a melee attack. This control scheme could
have been amazing, but the level design is un-interesting.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the controls are way too sluggish, so
you don&#8217;t really dodge enemies that way. The game compensates for
this by making the pace glacial. A few enemies (zombies) appear
and slowly walk towards to bottom of the screen. In the first few
levels, enemies rarely shoot projectiles, so it didn&#8217;t actually
feel like a shooting game.</p>

<p>This game could have been /Sin and Punishment/, but it was too
easy, too slow, and too boring.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing Street Fighter IV almost every day since I
bought it last August. I&#8217;ve managed to beat the game on some
difficulty with every fighter. I&#8217;ve beat the game on every
difficulty with C. Viper (my main.) I played through 10 of the
Time Attack challenges and 11 of the Survival challenges. I had
originally planned on beating every challenge before calling it a
day with this game, but I&#8217;ve begun to appreciate them less. I
don&#8217;t find it very fun to have arbitrary moves, etc taken away and
I&#8217;d rather just play the game itself. Since I don&#8217;t plan on buying
/Super/ any time soon, I think I will move on to
another fighter.</p>

<p>It was fun C. Viper. I&#8217;ll probably play every few weeks to
remember our times together :P</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just finished Ninja Gaiden for the NES. It was great to use
an authentic controller for it. It was also great to be able to
use save states because the game is so hard.</p>

<p>I really like the simple and straight-forward controls. I love
the arcade/shmup-like patterns and difficulties. Even though with
modern games, I loathe lame cut-scenes over boring stories, I find
them really entertaining in this game, because they are so
simplistic. The music and sound-effects overall are nice, in that
8-bit way.</p>

<p>For the first four acts (there are six), I limited myself to
one save state per screen. This was a significant challenge. When
I got to the fifth act, it was so tough that I was tempted by the
save states and used them after each obstacle. Each of the final
bosses (there are three) was defeated by using a save after each
hit I landed. Nevertheless, I feel very satisfied that I have been
able to get through the game, because even severely disadvantaging
it, it was very hard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to playing the sequel. If I play it again,
I will use save states much less to force myself to gain more
skill at the game.</p>

<time datetime="2010-05-15T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>15</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I played through The Legend of Zelda: The
Minish Cap. I knew I was almost done, so I stayed up a little too
late finish it tonight.</p>

<p>The graphics in this game are beautiful and vibrant. Many games
these days are dark and muddy, so it is refreshing to have such a
bright game. The game has the same style as /Link to the Past/,
but with a bit more cudly-ness.</p>

<p>The sound is good. I caught my wife humming a few of the
tunes.</p>

<p>The story is a respectable Zelda story. I like that the title
is a double entendre.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very good. It has the same core mechanics as
the first Zelda and /Link to the Past/ (my two
favourite), but almost all the items are brand new. The Kinstone
system (wherein you collect trinkets and give them to particular
NPCs) is a nice abstraction of a quest mechanic, although I
would&#8217;ve liked to have been able to get to the bonuses without
using a Kinstone, somehow. The boss fights are very fun and
difficult enough&#8212;I had to repeat two of them and the final
boss&#8217;s first form got me the first time. The dungeon designs are
good. The puzzles are interesting without being infuriating. I
only had a few times where I wanted to throw the control (all in
the Wind Palace, btw.) The world is big enough to make it
interesting and the teleport system is convenient.</p>

<p>I finished the game with 14 heart containers, two bottles,
without the boomerang, with the original shield, without any bomb
bag/quiver upgrades (actually I&#8217;m not sure if there are any) and
with all the sword techniques. It was a little hard to complete
with such a small amount of life and only two bottles, but it was
obviously do-able and fun.</p>

<p>I definitely still prefer /Link to the Past/, but
this is worth playing again and thus worth playing for the first
time too.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Since I bought Ikaruga back in August, I&#8217;ve <em>still</em> been playing
every day. I&#8217;ve played for 38 hours, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds
according to the game clock. I&#8217;ve recently made a nice
achievement, so I thought I would make a progress report.</p>

<p>My accomplishments to date:
- <em>Credit-feeding through the game on Easy, Normal, and Hard.</em>
This was the first thing I did by October. (It&#8217;s not totally
brain-dead because you have to beat the bosses within the time
limit.) I was able to get through Easy before unlocking
free-play.
- <em>Grade of A on Easy - Chapter 1.</em> I did this by the end of
November. It was really hard to get to that point, but now I get
an A without even thinking about it.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 1 - Dot Eater.</em> This only took a few tries and
was relatively easy. Done in November.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 2 - Dot Eater.</em> This was very hard, because it
requires pixel-perfect control to get through the blocks at the
beginning of the level. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIDc04e79M">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a> But it
only took about two months, maybe a little less. Done in
December.
- <em>Easy - Chapter 3 - Dot Eater.</em> This was /very hard/. I&#8217;ve been
working on this since December, but I just did it tonight. For
comparison, there are over a thousand people who&#8217;ve done Chapter
1 - Dot Eater, 103 who&#8217;ve done Chapter 2, and only 44 who&#8217;ve
done Chapter 3. (FWIW, 24 for Chapter 4 and 25 for the Final
Chapter.) There are four main challenges to this: first, getting
through the moving block lasers that push you into obstacles,
then getting through rows of enemies and moving spears, then
getting chased by/dealing with Shigi, then dealing with the
spinning boss Uzura. Yikes. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5iefdDhvs">Here&#8217;s a video of someone else.</a>
- <em>Easy and Normal - One credit to Chapter 3&#8217;s Boss.</em> Not much to
say here, except that doing these levels Dot Eater helps train
for the normal mode well.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/09/Game--Tomba---PS1--1998--0/">Game: Tomba! (PS1, 1998)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-05-09T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Tomba! over the past few weeks as my
&#8220;main&#8221; game.</p>

<p>This game defies categorization.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s primarily a platforming game with a few accoutrements to
that basic experience: you get a number of different weapons, some
speed bonuses in form of new pants, and some utility items like a
grappling hook and a parasol (so you fall slower.) While the world
and gameplay in primarily 2D, you often need to jump into the
&#8220;background&#8221; and onto a different plane. Sometimes when you go
into the background the camera rotates to a different slice of a
3D area you&#8217;re exploring. It&#8217;s very neat mechanically.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the game is the mission system. As you
interact with the world and individuals in it, they inform you of
a problem. If and when you solve it, you gain AP and unlock
potentially more missions. Some of them are required, but
definitely not all of them. There are 130 in the game; I found 106
and cleared 87 of them. (I ended with 755,900 AP. I reckon this
isn&#8217;t very much.)</p>

<p>Overall the game is very fun and unique. I imagine that Zelda II:
The Adventure of Link could have been like this game and moved the
Zelda series in a good direction rather the dead-end /Zelda II/
was. /Tomba!/ took me 4 hours and 27 minutes on the clock to beat,
but I would guess I probably spent closer to 2.5 times that amount
of time due to the difficulty of the platforming and bosses that
required reloading my save file.</p>

<p>I easily recommend it. Despite having typical PS1 loading time
problems, it&#8217;s definitely worth it. I&#8217;m excited to play the sequel
eventually.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week or so, I&#8217;ve played through Machinarium, a Flash
game available on many platforms&#8212;I played on the Mac.</p>

<p>It was a very enjoyable point-and-click adventure game. I
haven&#8217;t played one of those in a while, so it was very fresh for
me. The graphics were beautiful, to a totally stunning degree. The
puzzles were interesting without being opaque or infuriating. (The
only annoyances were the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the bad top-down
shooting/exploration mini-game at the end&#8212;it was bad because the
controls were horrible.) My favourite puzzles were the many
Sokoban variants, particularly the one in the Arcade and the
string of beads.</p>

<p>I got the game <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/machinarium_for_mac_free_today.html">for free</a>, so it was totally worth it. It costs <a href="http://www.macgamestore.com/detail.php?ProductID=1287">$20</a>
and I&#8217;d say it is worth closer to $15.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/07/Doll-House-0/">Doll House</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-05-07T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>May</span> <span class='day'>07</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>About two weeks ago, <em>REDACTED</em> and I wanted to do something together
but didn&#8217;t have a movie to watch, didn&#8217;t want to play New Super
Mario Brothers Wii, didn&#8217;t want to watch Seinfeld, and were feeling
lazy. So we decided to start watching a new Joss Whedon show,
Dollhouse. Naturally, we haven&#8217;t done much at night since then
except watch it. Last night we finished the second season and thus
the whole series.</p>

<p>This show is amazing and awesome. It&#8217;s very clever, in that Joss
way. The world is compelling and you feel like you understand it,
in that Joss way. The characters feel real, in that Joss way. There
is an epic story with twists and turns, in that Joss way. Everyone
needs to watch it. It helps suggests deep thoughts about free will,
love, desire, and technology that are fascinating and
important.</p>

<p>When I watched it, however, I realized one thing more than
anything else: /TV is Dead/.</p>

<p>I would /never/ watch live TV for any reason, other than General
Conference, even for a show as amazing as Dollhouse. If a show like
this can&#8217;t get me to watch TV, and since it was cancelled the
feeling is common, then good TV simply can&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>

<p>This is really sad, because easily my favourite creative person
in film/movies/etc is Joss Whedon and his forte is the arc and the
world that are only possible with TV serialization. That format
needs some other way of existing profitably. (DVD sales, etc can&#8217;t
do it because they assume it has already aired.) I don&#8217;t have any
ideas or advice, but I wish I did.</p>

<p>The looming cancellation of the show is incredibly present as
you watch it. It&#8217;s totally true that the second season feels like
it is on &#8220;fast forward&#8221;. There were many episodes where <em>REDACTED</em> and I
looked at each other and said, &#8220;That would be half a season if this
were Buffy&#8221;, or similar comments. Yet, I&#8217;m glad the show had so
much closure and moved so far, especially after the annoying
non-ending of Firefly.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Saturday, Sunday and this morning I played through VVVVVV, by
Terry Cavanagh.</p>

<p>This is a puzzle platformer with beautiful retro
audio-visuals. You can move left, right, and &#8220;flip&#8221; on to the
ceiling (or floor if you were on the ceiling.) This simple
mechanical system is used to a brilliant degree in the level
design. Some areas were incredibly frustrating, but incredibly
satisfying as well. My best experience was getting the &#8220;hardest&#8221;
trinket in the game, the one in /Doing Things the Hard Way/ (every
room has a clever name.) Here&#8217;s a video of someone else doing it:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=4CtiY5D6HCs&amp;feature=related">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my end-game stats:</p>

<p>Trinkets Found: Twelve of Twenty
Game Time: 3:46:19</p>

<p>Total Flips: 4995
Total Deaths: 2189</p>

<p>Hardest Room (with 261 deaths):
Veni</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another look at the statistics: 226 minutes. 22 flips
per minute. 9.7 deaths per minute.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend it! You can play on pretty much anything
that has Flash, so it&#8217;s easy to play.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In August I played through a bit of the first Professor Layton
game, but I didn&#8217;t start playing it every day until I finished
Picross DS a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I ended with 5076 picarats, 46 hint coins, play time clock of
11 hours and 39 minutes, and I found and solved every puzzle,
including the bonus challenge puzzles.</p>

<p>It is a very fun puzzle game, with an interesting variety of
puzzles. For some of them, I wrote little programs to find the
answer, because that&#8217;s how I do things. The story of the game was
also interesting. There were some mysteries that I solved a bit
earlier than the story revealed them, but I actually like that,
because it meant that the clues were actually enough to learn the
answer. In many pieces of fiction &#8220;mysteries&#8221; are simply crazy
things you can&#8217;t possible know until they come out of left
field. I&#8217;m glad this game wasn&#8217;t like that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely interested in playing the sequel, so I recommend
this game to you.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I played Kid Dracula for the Gameboy. It&#8217;s a very straight-forward
platformer with a shooting mechanic. It has a little bonus
mechanic of different kinds of magic that let Kid Dracula turn
into a bat, walk on the ceiling, use a protective umbrella,
etc. Most of these things are only useful in a few places in the
eight level game, but they are present enough to make it fun to
use them. The best part about the game, however, is the clever cut
parody of the Castlevania series. Most of the common enemies show
up in super-cute form.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Of the past two-ish months, I&#8217;ve played through Ketsui DEATH
LABEL, a vertical shooter from CAVE for the DS. It&#8217;s kind of a
port of an arcade game that has never had a home port.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a (primarily) boss rush game where every difficulty level
is just boss fights. It&#8217;s quite hard, but very fun. I was able to
1CC every mode, except the Extra mode. (The Extra mode is an
actual level from the arcade game and you don&#8217;t get as many
lives/bombs during it.)</p>

<p>I prefer the Type B ship, because it is a little slower and I
find it easier to not accidentally hit the edges of patterns. I
only used Type A on Normal and Hard A difficulties. (I used it on
my original Novice play-through, but when I went to get the scores
for this post it hadn&#8217;t registered, so I beat it again with Type
B.)</p>

<p>Type A:
Normal = 32,411,985
Hard A = 30,456,540</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In this post, I will &#8220;respond&#8221; to articles on the Internet about
FF13. I&#8217;ve been delaying reading any until after I beat, so I
think now is the appropriate time. I will do my best to not be a
rabid fan boy about it. My goal is to capture my reactions to new
ideas I read elsewhere, rather than to argue anyone who disagrees
with my preferences.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630">Tim Rogers</a>. This review is hilarious, as all his are. (He curses a
lot by the way.) Here&#8217;s a great quote: &#8220;The idea of the game is
that the characters all look like people who someone would want to
cosplay; they all act like characters who would be someone’s
favorite character.&#8221; His discussion of the battle system is spot
on. I suppose the big difference is that I love it and he
doesn&#8217;t. Same with launching enemies into the air. Here&#8217;s
something that is quite true:</p>

<blockquote><p>The battles will sometimes envelop you in<br/>sometimes ten entire minutes of grueling uphill climbing, forcing<br/>you to know that you’re doing something wrong. You pray for a<br/>zero-star ranking, for there to be some obvious “right way” to do<br/>this. Then the game gives you a five-star ranking, and your heart<br/>sinks: oh god, you are doing it the right way.</p></blockquote>


<p>Just read his comment about the monsters not looking like
anything. That&#8217;s true and its always been that way. I&#8217;m totally in
his &#8220;that&#8217;s the way things are&#8221; camp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-167136.phtml">Jim Sterling</a>. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a hardcore Final Fantasy XIII fan, prone
to emotional outburts and so defensive of Square Enix&#8217;s latest
effort that you&#8217;ll get upset by harsh criticism, then you&#8217;re
advised to not read this review. If you don&#8217;t want to see somebody
tear this game limb from limb, or are upset by videogame review in
general, then you should definitely not read it.&#8221; I can see why
someone would be upset at his review, but I&#8217;m not in the
least. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-joys-of-being-a-videogame-reviewer-167383.phtml">I&#8217;m amazed at how people react to him</a>.</p>

<p>I read a bunch of other reviews but didn&#8217;t really feel like
commenting on any of them.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/03/28/Game--Final-Fantasy-13--PS3--2010--1/">Game: Final Fantasy 13 (PS3, 2010) (2)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-03-28T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>28</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><h1>I love this game.</h1>

<p>I bought /Final Fantasy 13/ on release day&#8212;the first
time I&#8217;ve bought a game on release day in years&#8212;and I&#8217;ve been
playing it constantly ever since. Yesterday I beat the story, so I
think it is an appropriate time to talk about the game. I imagine
that I will have more thoughts after the end-game, but I&#8217;ll leave
those for a second post.</p>

<p>First, a note of warning, in this post I will talk about things
that I consider spoilers. However, keep in mind that I have cut
myself off from all video game related discussions during the past
20 days as I&#8217;ve been playing the game, so my spoiler threshold is
fairly low.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off with a little bit of numbers to give context to
somethings I talk about later. The game has 13 chapters. I spent
about 20 hours playing chapters 1 through 10. I spent about 20
hours in chapter 11. I spent about 12 hours playing chapter 12
and 13. The game is totally linear during until
chapter 11. Chapters 12 and 13 are also totally linear, but there
is an &#8220;escape&#8221; valve to go back to the non-linear chapter 11
area. I viewed this escape route as a way to grind if you couldn&#8217;t
handle the challenges in the final areas, so I didn&#8217;t use it. Now
that I&#8217;ve beat the game, I also see that the escape route is a way
to go back and do all the side excursions you didn&#8217;t do when you
beat the game. (There are 64 side missions. When I beat the game,
I had beat about 30 of them.)</p>

<h1>Story</h1>

<p>I really enjoyed the story of the game. I&#8217;d rate it about on
par with Final Fantasy VI, which as you may remember is my
previous favourite. The game does a very good job giving you
tidbits and making you feel like a part of the world from the
beginning. It gives the many twists in sensible places and it
isn&#8217;t too absurd. I think it is a bit similar to how in the
beginning of FF6, Kefka is clearly a bad guy, but it&#8217;s not obvious
he&#8217;s /the/ bad guy.</p>

<p>The structure of the game really works to make the story more
compelling. The linearity in the beginning forces you to get
engrossed in the characters and world, rather than in the
mechanics. The space in the middle where there is a lot of freedom
works well with the story because the characters are mostly lost
and not sure what to do, which you reflect in your wandering
exploration. When you finally find out how to get back on to the
main line story, the train starts rolling and brings you to the
destination. Rather than a hundred hours of chocobo races while a
meteor is falling to destroy the planet, you have a focused strike
to the heart of the enemy. Not once did the linearity bother
me.</p>

<p>The game does this thing where rather than a big cut scene,
there will be a medium one, then you walk for a little, fight a
few battles, then you get a short cut scene, then you repeat. This
is great because you never get bored or feel like you&#8217;re watching
a movie. However, there was a single time that it bothered
me. Without going into spoiling detail, there is one group working
together and then they split up into a few different groups, with
a totally new character accompany one person. The new character
has never met this person before and because the cut scene before
this was already long there is no conversation between them
introducing each other. You just start controlling this new
pair. After a few fights, however, they have the aforedesired
conversation. That was the one time I really wish I could turn
around, press a button, and have them talk to each other like in a
Western RPG.</p>

<h1>Music</h1>

<p>The music is beautiful. I got the soundtrack and listen to it a
lot. I really like the way the &#8220;Theme&#8221; is incorporated into so
many songs. My favourite is the music at the &#8220;Sunleth
Waterscape&#8221;.</p>

<h1><em>REDACTED</em>acters</h1>

<p>When I started playing I assumed that the game would be &#8220;about&#8221;
Lightning, in the same way FF7 is about Cloud or FF6 is about
Terra. Even though I felt that way the entire game, I realize in
retrospect that was really my choice as a player to keep her in my
battle time all the time and think about the events of the story
from her perspective. In actuality, every character really has
equal screen time and importance in the story. If anyone were
short changed, I think it would Sazh who is a non-entity during
the second half of the game and Fang/Vanille who don&#8217;t really open
up until a third through.</p>

<p>my wife asked me which character I felt like I identified with
most. I&#8217;m not sure there was one that was the most, but there was
something in each I can connect with. Lightning is driven by duty,
responsibility, and determination. Snow is driven by love and
bravery. Sazh is driven by his family. Fang is driven by the need
to protect and serve her family. Hope is at first driven by
revenge and then he becomes the symbol of hope and
rebirth. Vanille is the bright spot in the dreary world, trying to
cheer everyone up.</p>

<p>My favourite characters are the girls: Lightning, Vanille, and
Fang.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>Roleplaying games are cleanly separated into the story and the
gameplay. In many games there are multiple levels of gameplay.</p>

<p>For example, in many games there is the battle system, the
resource management system, the progression system, and the
exploration system. The battle system is the core and everything
else revolves around it. If you play the resource management game
poorly, then you can&#8217;t recover from battles or afford the needed
equipment to deal with larger threats. If you play the progression
game poorly, then you are not able to deal with the many
situations you&#8217;ll be put into, because you&#8217;ve focused poorly. If
you play the exploration system poorly, then you won&#8217;t find the
resources you need or you&#8217;ll die by a thousand paper cuts by
exploring too deeply without the needed resources. If you play the
battle system too cavalierly, by using too many powerful spells
you&#8217;ll hurt your resource management game even though you&#8217;ll beat
any battle. Conversely, if you don&#8217;t use your resources
effectively, you won&#8217;t be effective in the battle system.</p>

<p>The subtler aspects of the gameplay (resource management and
progression) are often missed by casual observers you see games as
flipping through menus. The exploration gameplay (which is often
implemented through random battles&#8212;they punish exploration) is
often frustrating when you can&#8217;t see it as a game of risk vs
reward. And the actual battle is often seen as flipping through
different menus, but a little bit faster.</p>

<p>A big problem with many games is that these systems don&#8217;t
interact in a way that is optimally fun or in a way that balances
fun across time. For example, you are going to spent most of your
gameplay time in battles. However, in most games the average
battle can&#8217;t be too hard because that would make the resource
management too hard. In almost all RPGs, you&#8217;ll find yourself in
some area and the challenge is to get the end of that area with as
much magic points as possible, so you that you can be fully healed
and charged for an actually hard battle with a boss. Each battle
along the way is trying to get you to spend too much magic (or
items, etc) to get through it, so that you will have depleted that
resource by the time you get to the boss. For that reason, almost
no random battle is actually ever hard in a RPG. If you want to
win, you can pull out everything and get through it. But, if you
did that, you&#8217;d ruin your chances of beating the boss. This is why
when you play most games you spend 90% of the time pressing
&#8220;Attack&#8221; rather than using magic. This is boring because you
aren&#8217;t making decisions. It&#8217;s not exciting because you&#8217;re not
getting to see the cool visuals of the spells, summons, etc. It&#8217;s
not exciting because you&#8217;re never really in danger.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 13 does not have this problem.</p>

<p>The biggest departure from the genre FF13 makes, in my opinion,
is not having a tightly linear story. It is removing the resource
management game.</p>

<p>In FF13, you are fully healed after every single battle and
there is no MP inside or outside of battle. If you take battles
one at a time, you can throw everything you have at them and know
that you&#8217;ll be able to through the same stuff out next time. This
gives the designers the freedom to make every battle hard. It
gives the player the freedom to make the battles exciting by using
everything at their disposal. This is also why when you die you
can start immediately in front of the enemy that killed you. Your
death couldn&#8217;t possibly have anything to do with things you did
before. That makes deaths more of a teaching experience.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not totally true. There are resources in the
game. The battle resources are Technical Points, healing items,
and shrouds. The upgrading system (part of the progression system)
uses resources called components. However, the battle resources
are almost entirely unimportant. Technical Points allow you to use
your summons and special powers. You only have 5 and you get about
1 after every battle (if you do well.) It is not hard to manage
them and I basically treated them like MP in other games: reserved
for really hard fights. The healing items are basically worthless
once you can have a Medic in your party all the time and once you
learn the Raise spell. In fact, I never used them after that. They
seem to be there so that you can heal in the beginning of the
game. Thus, managing them is never really an issue. Shrouds give
you little buffs before a battle and I never used them, not
once. They did seem pretty scarce, but it never affected me.</p>

<p>Since there is basically no resource management relative to the
battle system, the battle system is fundamentally different than
all games before it. Every single battle requires strategic
thinking to defeat, not just the bosses. There were many times
when I would die from fighting a normal enemy, think about what I
did wrong, try something different, die again, then try a third
thing, and get through. That is soooo satisfying. It is satisfying
on a &#8220;shmup&#8221;-like level. As mentioned before, in a normal RPG
dying almost certainly means you are idiot. If you die in a random
battle, you were too stupid to pull out all the stops. If you die
in a boss battle, you were too flagrant with your use of abilities
in the earlier battles or you didn&#8217;t figure out what the
vulnerabilities of the boss were. In FF13, a death is a great
learning experience that makes you appreciate the game more.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the battle system, which is a
little orthogonal to lack of resource management, is that you
actually need to employ all the features of the battle system to
be successful. (It is, of course, related to the lack of resources
because you are now free to utilize everything as well.) For
example, many games have status effects which you can give to
enemies (debuffs), however they almost never work on bosses, and
since they cost MP, you never use them. Similarly, many games have
status effects which you can give yourself (buffs), however their
effects are generally so small that it is only worthwhile to use
on bosses, but even then you&#8217;ve taken MP away from your damage or
healing potential, so you probably won&#8217;t use them. In FF13, you
need to use your buffs and debuffs a lot. Similarly, many games
have tried to use defending classes to draw enemy blows,
etc. (Cyan from FF6 and Auron from FF10 are examples of this.)
There&#8217;s almost no use for this though because bosses don&#8217;t fall
for it and normal battles can be won by all-out attacks. Again,
FF13 really requires the Sentinel class. I could go, but I think
you get the point.</p>

<p>In a bit more visceral of a way, the battle system is
exciting. Even though you wait for the ATB gauge to charge before
unleashing attacks, I felt compelled to slam out commands as fast
as possible. I had to dart my eyes around and take in my party&#8217;s
health, the enemy&#8217;s stagger bar, the enemy attacks that were
charging, etc. It&#8217;s really fun.</p>

<p>The fundamental strategy of the battle system is very versatile
too. Basically in every battle you are trying to get an enemy&#8217;s
stagger bar to 100% then unleash powerful attacks on to destroy
it. Most attacks are relatively ineffective if an enemy isn&#8217;t
staggered, so you have to do it. But, to stagger you need to focus
more on attacking than on defending or healing. Thus, you open
yourself up to attacks, so you have to drop back in a defensive
posture. But, if you wait too long, then your stagger progress
will be lost, so you have to switch back. Thus, the central
strategy compels you into a style of play where you are constantly
on the edge of winning or losing. This makes the game really
fun.</p>

<p>This change to the structure of the gameplay wasn&#8217;t perfectly
integrated though. In particular, the exploration game is mostly
gone. Since each battle is a fresh start for your characters,
there is no punishment for exploring too far or taking the time to
look down a hallway for another treasure sphere. As a result, the
placement of treasure is almost totally predictable and when
you&#8217;re wrong there&#8217;s no big deal. It&#8217;s clear they tried to
recreate this by having almost every treasure &#8220;guarded&#8221; by a
particular enemy. Yet, it doesn&#8217;t work the same. However, the
exploration game was always much smaller in RPGs than roguelikes,
so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>

<p>The final system, the progression system, of FF13 is great
too. There&#8217;s two parts to it. The character progression
(Crystarium) and the equipment progression (upgrading). The
Crystarium is a mostly linear path through the skills and
abilities of your roles. It does a few things really well
however. First, all characters get Crystarium points, whether they
are in battle or not. This is a major frustration in other games
where you are suddenly forced to use different characters and you
have to grind to get them to the level they need to be for the
part of the game you&#8217;re at. Second, it is really incremental. You
can get a new perk after only one or two battles. Third, even
though the path is mostly linear, you have to make a few important
decisions. Do you go for the new abilities that lie slightly off
the path and cost more? Or, do you go for the role bonus,
accessory, or ATB charge? Do you cherry pick from the various
roles trying to max one particular ability? (For example,
Vanille&#8217;s strength isn&#8217;t really a factor for the roles I put her
in, so it makes more sense to get her magic from other roles.) Do
you branch out of your primary roles? Etc. There are enough
decisions to make it fun, not enough to make it overwhelming, and
you can&#8217;t really lock yourself into a stupid configuration like
you can in other games.</p>

<p>The equipment upgrading game is /the/ place where resource
management matters. Equipment requires components to
upgrade. Organic components make synthetic components more
effective. Synthetic components do the major upgrading. Both can
be dropped from monsters or bought with gil that is dropped or
received for selling other drops, but the game is very stingy
about drops and gil in general, so you feel perpetually in need of
more stuff. There&#8217;s not much more to say about it other than it&#8217;s
not so easy it&#8217;s boring and it&#8217;s not so hard it&#8217;s
frustrating. (However, I haven&#8217;t fully upgraded anything and I&#8217;m
not looking forward to raising the 2.2 million gil to buy the
component I need to do it.)</p>

<h1>User Interface</h1>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have any major problems with the game in any aspect of
it. However, I definitely had nitpicks that are almost totally
about the user interface.</p>

<p><em>Battles.</em> I would&#8217;ve like more button binding when switching
paradigms. As it is, you have six or so in a list. You press L1 to
select one. I&#8217;d like to be able to press L1, then press a face
button to jump to a particular determined paradigm. That way I
could have Triangle be my preferred defending paradigm, Square be
my staggering, and X be my staggered, etc. I would have also liked
the ability to setup ability chains to enter simultaneously,
rather than slowly selecting them one by one.</p>

<p><em>Crystarium.</em> I would&#8217;ve like to see to how many Crystarium points
each character had at the end of each battle. I spent too much
time opening up the menu to check if there was anything I could
get. Even better would&#8217;ve been the ability to pick a target power
and have all my points automatically go towards that power after
each battle.</p>

<p><em>Paradigms.</em> Every time you change your battle party all your
paradigms setups are lost. Arggh! They should at least be remember
per party. Even better would be the ability to name and save sets
of configurations for different situations. I would&#8217;ve like the
ability to press L1 from the map and change my default paradigm
before a battle, rather than having to go through the main menu.</p>

<p><em>Equipment.</em> I would&#8217;ve like the ability to name sets of
equipment. I would&#8217;ve like to be able to use the &#8220;Optimize&#8221; option
on a single slot or perhaps fix a particular slot. (Specifically,
I like to use Optimize, but don&#8217;t want it to remove my Item
Collector equipment.)</p>

<p><em>Exploration.</em> Gran Pulse really needs a single map. I had a hard
time remember which teleporting location was which by just their
names. Similarly, I should be able to look at a different area&#8217;s
map rather than having to be in the area.</p>

<p><em>Missions.</em> As it is, a C&#8217;ieth stone that you can take a mission
from is blue-y, if you&#8217;ve never completed the mission is pulses. I
think they should&#8217;ve been a different color for missions you
haven&#8217;t got yet. That would&#8217;ve been much more convenient. I don&#8217;t
understand what value the gameplay gets from not being able to
have multiple active missions at a time. There were times when I
was on a mission, passed another mission pickup spot, passed that
same mission&#8217;s end point, then got to the mark of the mission I
was on, completed it, then had to backtrack twice: once to get the
new mission then once to get to its mark. That&#8217;s really
annoying. I don&#8217;t think it would make the game much easier to do
it differently.</p>

<h1>Replay</h1>

<p>If this game had a New Game+, I would play it again instantly to
get the story again.</p>

<p>I plan on continuing to play to finish all the missions,
although I don&#8217;t consider this &#8220;Replaying&#8221; the game. I&#8217;m playing
that content for the first time and I&#8217;m continuing my enjoyment of
the gameplay systems.</p>

<p>I can imagine playing through the main game again relatively
soon (say a year or eighteen months), but I can&#8217;t imagine going
through all the missions, etc in the same time period. I imagine I
will treat this game like FF6 or FF7. I&#8217;ve beaten all the Weapons
and gotten everything in FF7 once, but I&#8217;ve played and beat the
game four or five times. I&#8217;ve played through FF6 five or six
times, and gotten everything twice.</p>

<time datetime="2010-03-05T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Mar</span> <span class='day'>05</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I played Snatcher, Hideo Kojima&#8217;s second video game, for
the Sega CD. I&#8217;m a huge fan of his Metal Gear series and I&#8217;ve
always heard of how cool /Snatcher/ was, so I finally got around
to playing it.</p>

<p>The gameplay isn&#8217;t very deep. The puzzles and adventure game-style
fetching is pretty basic. The shooting scenes are trivial and
mostly unnecessary. But, the story and presentation is pretty
amazing, particularly if you can put your mind back in the late
80s/early 90s. You can really see how it fits into his overall
career in terms of the style, some of the core ideas, and the
&#8220;feel&#8221; of the story. For example, Kojima is very good at
suggesting that there is a deeper interesting world behind his
games; a few instances of this I liked were the subtle references
to genetically modified pets and Martian mining. A few other
things I really enjoyed were the references to other video games
at the time in the night club and to pop-culture, e.g. talking
about &#8220;Michael Jaxson&#8221; and how he is strange. The game also makes
me appreciate /Metal Gear Solid 4/&#8217;s Metal Gear Mk.II&#8212;in
/Snatcher/ your assistant has the same name and looks roughly the
same too.</p>

<p>It was a good history lesson and I enjoyed it, but I shouldn&#8217;t
have stayed up so late. :)</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/28/Game--Panzer-Dragoon--SAT--1995--0/">Game: Panzer Dragoon (SAT, 1995)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-28T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>28</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>The first game I decided to play with my new Sega Saturn was
Panzer Dragoon. When I first owned a Saturn, I bought Panzer
Dragoon Saga, but I didn&#8217;t appreciate its uniqueness. I assumed it
would just be a normal JRPG and I don&#8217;t really remember getting
that into it.</p>

<p>I decided to play this game because I enjoyed Sin and Punishment
so much. I assumed that /Panzer/ would be an Ur-Sin and
Punishment. It&#8217;s strange because I didn&#8217;t appreciate this game for
the same reason I didn&#8217;t appreciate /Saga/ when I was younger:
different expectations.</p>

<p>The core gameplay of /Panzer/ is definitely fun and
a forebear of a kind of game that I really like, however, a lot of
things didn&#8217;t work for me. The controls left a lot to be desired,
it was very easy to accidentally swing the camera more than the
number of arcs you intended and I never felt in control of the
dragon&#8217;s position on the screen, so it was hard to avoid
obstacles, etc. There is a severe lack of contrast between the
enemies (and their bullets) and the background, so it is hard to
tell what you need to shoot at or avoid. These two mechanical
problems were pretty big deal breakers for me. The main difficulty
I felt playing it was dealing with the systems, rather than an
actual hurdle I needed to bring myself over. (This is, of course,
a classic critique of many old games, but I think it fits this one
appropriately because the exact gameplay has been done well in
other places.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was a lot to enjoy about the game. First,
the story is pretty epic. One of my favourite things, however, is
that the story explains why you don&#8217;t control the path of the
Dragon (i.e., why it is on rails): you&#8217;re not the true rider, he
died and you happened to be there, his last words: &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8230;let
him [his killer] go back to The Tower&#8230;my dragon&#8230;knows the
way&#8230;&#8221; Brilliant. Second, many of the level setups are really
inspired and spectacular. The first was the giant sandworms in the
second level. Gorgeous. The next was the boss in the third level:
you have to dodge vertically these rotating fans. It worked really
well and was different from the earlier segments. (BTW, I
mentioned it was hard to dodge in general, but it was definitely
easier vertically.) The next was the fourth level. Flying through
the tiny tunnels makes you feel like Luke Skywalker taking out the
Death Star. Also brilliant.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that I would have loved this game when it first
came out, but it is not worth it (for me) to spend my time
perfecting my performance in it. I will definitely play the
sequels, however.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I ordered Mushihime-sama Futari Ver 1.5 for XBox 360 from Japan
recently and it got here on Thursday. I played it a little bit on
Thursday night, but this morning I decided to give the easiest
mode a try. (BTW, This game has an obscene number of ways to play
it. Yikes.)</p>

<p>I played Novice Mode on Original with Normal Reco. I 1cc&#8217;d the
game on my first try (although I did use each of the three lives
and barely scrapped by in the end.) I ended up with 213,392,414
points. For comparison, the current top score on the <a href="http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=23025">shmups forum</a>
is 383,360,831 for that configuration. And the highest of any
score on that list is 4,905,110,042 in Maniac Arrange mode.</p>

<p>So, Novice is pretty dang easy. It is nice to have a good starting
point though, I guess.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a YouTube link to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mushihimesama+futari&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=mushih">videos of the game</a>. It is beautiful
and the music is amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I played the next day and one life&#8217;d it on the same
settings. I ended up with 258,768,585 points. I will move on to
other modes now.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned, I&#8217;ve been playing Radilgy on my Dreamcast. In my
last post, I wrote about how I wasn&#8217;t sure how much longer I would
play it. Well, I think I&#8217;m pretty satisfied now.</p>

<p>I know that I /could/ get better, but I think I would rather move
on. In the past week, since my first win, I&#8217;ve beaten it three
more times. My first win was on Easy with 5 lives per continue. My
second was on Normal with 5 lives per continue. My third was on
Normal with 4 lives per continue. And my fourth (completed about 5

final2, 2-3:5 final2, 1-1:5 final2, 1-2:5 final2, WIN!</p>

<p>I started recording just wins with the configuration. Then I added
when I died. Then I tracked when I spent each /i/th
continue. (I switched to when I spent continue number /i/,
because it was easier to eye-ball.) I recorded particularly
depressing losses when the final form of the final boss was almost
dead. Finally today, I kept track of when I lost each life. Also
today I switched from using the Wide shot to using the 123
Laser. My impression is that one weapon isn&#8217;t more powerful than
another, but that they represent different play styles. I realized
today that I was focusing my shots at a single enemy typically, so
I might as well use the weapon that corresponds to that style. The
main difference I observed was being able to take care of the boss
a little faster.</p>

<p>This process I&#8217;ve just gone through&#8212;training and recording
performance&#8212;makes me think about features I would like in a
shooter. Here&#8217;s a few:
- <em>Data!</em> I wish the game would keep track of all the data I was
tracking by hand so I could find out where I was dying a lot and
where I needed to practice. It would even be nicer if the
granularity of this data was very fine; for example, I&#8217;d like to
know that I always die on the third attack of the fourth
mini-boss.
- <em>Progress-based Scoreboard</em> I&#8217;d like to be able to sort my
scoreboard (+ the public one in modern games) by how far in the
game/level the score was completed at. For example, I&#8217;m
currently working on 1cc-ing Ikaruga and doing chapter 3
Dot-Eater style. I&#8217;m not playing for score, so I&#8217;d like to be
able to (at a glance) see if I&#8217;ve gotten further than I have
before.
- <em>Practice modes</em> Most games are pretty good about allowing you
to practice chapters you&#8217;ve unlocked and some (Ikaruga on
Gamecube, for example) allow you to practice individual chapter
stages. I&#8217;d like this to be more common and with finer
granularity.
- <em>Trainer</em> Even better than a practice mode would be a mode where
the game planned your practice regime based on your previous
game performance. It would be rad also if you could loop bosses
or bullet patterns until you got through them without having to
go through all of the surrounding game.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there&#8217;s something very satisfying about playing the
beginning of a game so many times you can destroy it without
mercy.</p>

<time datetime="2010-02-26T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>26</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been hearing more and more about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>, the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/">GiantBomb</a> previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml">what he loved</a> and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn&#8217;t
love]]. And this morning I listened to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689">Active Time Babble</a> talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.</p>

<p>I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.</p>

<p>A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- <em>Challenging Battles:</em> Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I&#8217;ve also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- <em>Controlled Progression:</em> ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn&#8217;t unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can&#8217;t accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I&#8217;ll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- <em>Controlled Cast:</em> ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don&#8217;t have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact <em>in
character</em> in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don&#8217;t think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don&#8217;t use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don&#8217;t actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I&#8217;m excited about
that.
- <em>Linear Progression:</em> ATB mentioned that you can&#8217;t unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- <em>Post-game:</em> The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you&#8217;ve already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>For giggles, I&#8217;ll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can&#8217;t think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don&#8217;t think 11 really
counts anyways. I&#8217;d like to do 8 and 9 again.)</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/19/Game--Radilgy--DC--2006--0/">Game: Radilgy (DC, 2006)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-19T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>19</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently bought a Dreamcast. The very first game I played was
The Typing of the Dead, but I only played it for a few minutes to
show to Wifey. The very first game I played in depth is &lt;a
Radilgy, a shmup.</p>

<p>The art style is really unique and good looking. The controllers
are quite tight. The weapons are fun. (I really like the lasers
and the bubbles. I play most of the time with the lasers though.)
The shield, sword, and force field are nice touches.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth levels have these segments that require
spamming the force field over and over and over. (At least, that&#8217;s
how I do it!) It is pretty insane. Each of the end bosses is
really fun. The mid-level bosses are a little repetitive, because
they have the same core attacks, but they fit well and create a
nice feel for the game. (As I understand from the Wikipedia story,
those are the terrorists and the end bosses are warped
robots.)</p>

<p>My one complaint with the game is that the graphics are so
bright and there is so much flashing that it becomes hard to look
at after a while. I&#8217;ve been playing in 20-ish minute chunks then
doing something else.</p>

<p>I just beat it on Easy with 6 credits and 5 life credits using the
laser. I&#8217;ve been working on a number of different
configurations. I don&#8217;t like it when shmups have so many options,
because I don&#8217;t have a good grasp of what the &#8220;right&#8221; options
are. There is also a big temptation to make it easier, etc. I
wonder, should I try to 1cc it on Easy, then Normal, then Hard? Or
just got right to a different difficulty, etc? I can use 1 credit
to get to the middle of stage 3 (the mini-boss) on Normal. I&#8217;ve
gotten through stages 1 and 2 without ever dying as well. How
should I go about it? I plan on definitely playing for a little
while, but I don&#8217;t want to make it a permanent pursuit like
/Ikaruga/.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/11/Game--Overlord--X360--2007--0/">Game: Overlord (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-11T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>11</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I started playing Overlord last night and played a little more
today; I probably spent about 3 hours on it. My brother-in-law
recommended it to me and lent me his copy, but I sat on it for a
few months before getting around to it.</p>

<p>I admittedly did not play the whole game, but I found it
frustrating and boring. Some aspects of the frustration:
- It takes a few minutes to go from the Dashboard to actually
playing the game
- Getting back to what you were doing after saving is annoying,
because unlike a shmup when you play the same sections over and
over you have to pass the challenge again, in contrast you walk
through empty boringness in Overlord to get back
- There is no in-game map (period OR on the screen)
- There is no in-game record of the details of quests and no way
to talk to people, so as I wandered around in the beginning I
unlocked quests that I don&#8217;t remember what they told me to do
now
- There are many times where the game is very vague about what you
should do, for example when you fight a halfling warrior your
minions start dancing and you&#8217;re supposed to stop the music but
you can&#8217;t hit him when you attack (I see that this an FAQ in the
walkthrough on GameFAQs. Game design: Fail!)
- You can control your minions with the right stick, but if they
get distracted they get separated and then chaos breaks
loose. It is hard to tell which group the game thinks you are
controlling and they start going crazy.</p>

<p>Now on to some stuff I find boring:
- I found myself holding down the right trigger (Minions, Go!) and
wandering around while they did stuff. This was enough to
successfully complete about 5 or 6 quests. If that&#8217;s what the
rest of the game will be like, I&#8217;m not interested.
- The combat system is a single button for attacks and a single
button for spells. Yawn. Maybe there would be diversity later
on, but it didn&#8217;t seem that way and it didn&#8217;t seem necessary (re
the previous comment.)
- There was no risk. In addition the single way to be effective, I
quickly had hundreds of evil points to summon minions with if
they ever died so I couldn&#8217;t imagine ever dying because I could
always just retreat and get some more at the last spawning pit.</p>

<p>I can see why someone might like the mechanic enough to look
behind these problems and I&#8217;m quite picky, but because I&#8217;m so
picky I was going to finish this game. Maybe the sequel fixed
these issues?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recommend it. But I didn&#8217;t finish it. Take that with
appropriate salt.</p>

<p>Frustrating, boring mechanic</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Castle Crashers was on sale a few weeks ago, so I bought it. Since
I just finished Fallout, I got the chance to play it. I&#8217;d played
it a few times about my brother-in-law&#8217;s house, but I really sat
down and went through it last night and tonight. Beat-em-ups are
one of my favourite old school genres, so I really appreciated
it. I used by Arcade Stick and it turned to not be a great idea
because the controls aren&#8217;t adjustable and the defaults don&#8217;t work
as well on the stick. Bummer.</p>

<p>I played through as the Red Knight pumping Strength and Defense
the whole time, basically never using Magic or Arrows. It was
definitely really fun. The Behemoth does my kind of humour also,
so that made the experience really enjoyable. I liked the few
parts that used really different gameplay&#8230; like the bosses, the
Industrialist Castle, right before the boss at the Ice Castle,
etc.</p>

<p>Rad game! I just wish that I had people to play it with often,
it would definitely be worth more to me if that were the
case.</p>

<p>Played as Red Knight, Arcade Stick, Max Str/Def</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/09/Game--Fallout-3--X360--2008--0/">Game: Fallout 3 (X360, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2010-02-09T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Feb</span> <span class='day'>09</span> <span class='year'>2010</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing /Fallout 3: Game of the
Year Edition/ (it comes with all the DLC.) This is the first
Western-style RPG I&#8217;ve ever played.</p>

<p>I started out on my own and played about 7 hours. I noticed
pretty quickly that there were many things that I was missing,
both from the perspective of loot and from the perspective of
quests and story events. So, I stopped and restarted and used a
spoiler-free walkthrough. I felt really dirty doing this. In
retrospect, I would have really disliked playing it again and
would have felt like I was cheated out of getting the full
experience if not for the walkthrough.</p>

<p>I thought that the VATS combat system was really fun, but after
about 20 hours of trying to figure out how to target the head, it
got really frustrating or boring, depending on if it was working
or not. I thought the story was interesting, but there were
interface problems that really hurt experiencing it. First, much
of the story and background is told through text, but the text
display is not designed to be read from a couch: it is green text
on black background that is deliberately fuzzy to simulate the
terminal it is being read on /plus/ it doesn&#8217;t use the
whole screen because of the simulation. /Very annoying./ In
fact, so annoying, that I simply stopped reading text after a
about 20 hours. The background was interesting, but not
interesting enough to suffer through the bad interface.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a good description of the game for me: good ideas that
take too long or are presented to poorly to sustain the fun. I
completed every single quest and got to level 29 and about 50% of
the way to level 30. Yet, I don&#8217;t want to finish all the
achievements, get all the Bobbleheads, or explore every area
because I know that it will be frustrating and boring. I spent
59.75 hours on the game but don&#8217;t want to spend a minute
more. That says a lot about the game to me. Yet, I don&#8217;t regret it
and would recommend it, although perhaps on the PC where your face
would be closer to the screen.</p>

<p>There were numerous technical problems as well. It crashed
about a half-dozen times. After about 30 hours it would regularly
get very slow. I got stuck in walls, in debris, on train tracks,
etc and had to restart and lose progress. I had quests get into
stuck states and had to restart.</p>

<p>Most of the DLC was quite good. The Pitt was dumb. Operation
Anchorage was boring. But Broken Steel and Point Lookout were
great. Mothership Zeta was borderline, but the loot was pretty
awesome.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I will play older Bethesda games because there
were so many technical and UI problems, but I will keep an eye out
for future releases.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Ikaruga last August and I have been playing every single
day since then (except for when I was away on trips&#8230;)  It is
unbelievably amazing. The more I play the more I realize what a
masterpiece it is. I just want to talk about one part of it right
now:</p>

<p>/metaphor/</p>

<p>The whole game is a metaphor for life. As you play it, the
mechanics of the game force you to put yourself into the mind of
Shinra (the pilot of the Ikaruga.) The game starts with this
quote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not die until I achieve something.
Even though the ideal is high, I never give in.
Therefore, I never die with regrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is this about Shinra?: The single surviving member of the army
that fought against the Horai; the man who has been nursed back to
health by the defeated people of the island town of Ikaruga; the
man who will fight against &#8220;The Power of the Gods&#8221;; (SPOILER) the
man who dies to destroy the Ubusunagami Okinokai?</p>

<p>Is this about the player playing the game?: The game acknowledges
its difficulty and how it cannot be casually won; even though it
&#8220;only&#8221; lasts 29 minutes, I&#8217;ve played for over 20 hours and am not
even close to conquering it; I practice every day so I can achieve
something and I never give in.</p>

<p>Or is this about the player in his normal life?: We all face
adversity, but we must achieve something and fight for our ideals
or else we will die with regrets.</p>

<p>By teaching the player about Shinra, teaching the player about
himself as player, the game teaches the player about himself as a
person.</p>

<p>I have a hard time thinking of other games that do this.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently played through Super Mario World for the first
time. When I got a Super Nintendo it didn&#8217;t come with this game,
so I didn&#8217;t play it a lot or beat, but I had played it before. I
used to not really be into platformers, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older I
like them much more. This game was really fun. I love all the
different kinds of enemies and the differently colored Yoshis were
very fun. I played through every level, except the Special
World. After doing the first special level, the second was
mind-bogglingly hard for me. Perhaps I will go back later.</p>

<p>I beat this game. I didn&#8217;t get every goal, because sometimes I
only got the secret one. And I didn&#8217;t do the special world. There
is a save state (#1) that has me before going in the Back Door of
Bowser&#8217;s Castle.</p>

understand Japanese, so the long Anime cutscenes and conversations
didn&#8217;t have a big impact on me, but I appreciated their
presence. The shmuping was good, but the controls are way too

<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I played Bonk&#8217;s Adventure for the PC Engine (or
TurboGrafx-16.) The beginning of the game was very fun and
straight-forward, but once you get to the final level the
difficulty ramps up to an insane degree. It starts with a tunnel
in the water where there are spikes on the top and the bottom and
I have no idea how to get through without just spending multiple
lives to get through it. After that, there is a huge level full of
Mega Man-style disappearing blocks. Then there&#8217;s basically a boss
rush where you face all the previous bosses then two final bosses,
which are both insane. Nevertheless, the game was fun, but crazy
at the end. I got 66,080 points. Word.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I played through Metal Slug for the Neo-Geo. I didn&#8217;t
do very well: I got 508k points and used 28 continues. Ouch. It
was really fun though. The graphics in this game are /amazing/! I
have a hard time thinking of a modern game that is as
beautiful. The only real problem with the game is that shooting
diagonally is a big pain, but I probably just need practice. I
can&#8217;t wait to play it again or play sequels!</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/20/Game--Assassin-s-Creed--X360--2007--0/">Game: Assassin&#8217;s Creed (X360, 2007)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-20T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>20</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just played this for the Xbox 360. What a disappointment. The
most interesting part of the game were the twenty-ish minutes of
cutscenes, and even they weren&#8217;t that great. The best thing about
the game is the fiction that isn&#8217;t even in the game, but mentioned
and <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=175552">explained elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>The main problem with the game is that the story and scenario are
totally inconsistent with the gameplay. Altair is supposed be a
stealthy assassin who doesn&#8217;t resort to crude violence, but the
game requires it from you. There are many times where to advance
you must either fight a half-dozen guards to unlock some scholars
to get through something &#8220;stealthily&#8221; or fight a dozen guards to
get through violently. There is often no way to actually sneak in
or save the citizen that unlocks the scholars (which doesn&#8217;t make
sense anyway, btw) non-violently. But it doesn&#8217;t even matter
anyways, because there would be no reward for doing that. The
combat is mindlessly easy, so you can just blaze through dozens of
guards. If you listen to the advice of the game or the story, you
will be tempted to act cautiously, walk rather than run, flee from
guards, etc, but that just makes the game slow and painful; you
can get the same things accomplished easier by ignoring that
advice. It&#8217;s not even as if you could create a challenge for
yourself by playing it the &#8220;real&#8221; way, because the game forces you
out of the assassin&#8217;s mindset many times. The ending is the most
absurd form of this where you have to battle through multiple
armies.</p>

<p>An equally big problem with the game is that the main mechanics
are just not fun. The combat is so easy that it isn&#8217;t fun. The
things that are designed to make it fun (the different moves)
aren&#8217;t necessary and the controls are terrible for them
anyway. You can counter every single attack and you never need to
use any weapon other than the sword. Saving citizens is annoying
because they all say the same thing and you have to use the stupid
combat system. Interrogation is lame because you just slam the
punch button. The races are frustrating because the movement
controls are so horrible.</p>

<p>The only fun parts to me were climbing up viewpoints and the
pickpocketing. Yet, both were ruined in some way. The climbing
controls are horrendous. First, you just hold two buttons and
point. Second, you wiggle endlessly because half of the time
Altair just hangs on in one spot because the camera isn&#8217;t angled
just the right way for him to move. Third, Altair jumps off the
wall for no reason because obviously you meant to jump off the
building, not to the next ledge. Fourth, every building was
basically the same after a while. Nevertheless, I can honestly say
I enjoyed looking for a good way up to a view point then getting
the spin once I was on top. The pickpocketing was just as bad. I
would&#8217;ve liked it to have been hard because there were guards
watching, or complicated paths, or something. But they were all
either mindlessly easy or hard because stupid beggars and crazy
people were in your way. Ugh!</p>

<p>Let me nitpick more. Beggars! I hate them. They are begging for
you to break the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and just kill them. Crazy people
punching you and breaking your cover for no reason! They make no
sense! Why don&#8217;t they attack normal people? Why are they even
there?  Such a ridiculous &#8220;gamey&#8221; thing in an otherwise reasonable
world. Flags! Pfff!</p>

<p>One final complaint. The game robs you of your agency in an
obscene way. The game asks you to follow the Assassin&#8217;s Creed and
be discrete, but of course you can&#8217;t follow that to win because of
the mechanics as mentioned above. But similarly, there are many
times when you control Altair, but you don&#8217;t control whether he
follows the Creed in your opinion. For example, after every
interrogation he murders the person interrogated. There is almost
never a reason to do this and it seems to violate the rules about
killing innocents, but you can&#8217;t have a say, because it is a
cut-scene. My wife was sitting by me when this happened and I
complained and she said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in the simulation anyways,
so it&#8217;s already decided.&#8221; That&#8217;s true and it is exactly the
problem. If this is really a simulation, then it should just be a
&#8220;ride&#8221;, but once you can control Altair, you should be able to
control everything. At first, I thought that the Animus concept
would be a great way to explain the gamey things, but it just
became absurd.</p>

<p>I do /not/ recommend this game. You will get what is good out of
it by watching the cut scenes or reading the story online.</p>

<p>Repetitive, boring slog.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/17/Game--Castlevania--Order-of-Ecclesia--DS--2008--0/">Game: Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2008)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-17T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>17</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing this. Castlevania&#8230; how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:</p>

<p>The main character, Shanoa, is fascinating. It is a little old to
have a character that has lost their memory, but because the game
starts where she has her memory and then she loses it in the
prologue, it is much more believable and interesting. I love that
she is a such a powerful woman. She&#8217;s beautiful, but IMHO in a
respectful way; she doesn&#8217;t fit the typical sex-object stereotype
of video game women. (Yeah, she&#8217;s wearing a backless dress, but
her long hair covers it up except when she&#8217;s absorbing a glyph.)
The final sequence, after beating Dracula, is such beautiful
closure to her character.</p>

<p>The graphics are so fresh and fluid. Something most Castlevania
fans have to come to terms with is that the majority of the enemy
graphics are reused game to game. This game, however, is almost
entirely fresh. The backgrounds are amazingly vivid for the
DS. Shanoa is beautifully illustrated&#8230; I love the animation for
absorbing a glyph.</p>

<p>The scope of the game is so grand. Rather than a single map, it is
more like Portrait of Ruin, where there are many areas to travel
through. However, rather than a central hub map, there is an
overworld and most areas have a few entrances/exits&#8230; some
hidden. It did a very good job of making the world feel
real. That&#8217;s something that I love about Castlevania games: in the
older games, the levels are sensibly connected and in the
post-SOTN games the map is huge and &#8220;makes sense&#8221;. This game is
missing some of the backtracking and exploration from earlier
games, because the way areas are connected is generally linear;
but there are few areas that you revisit in the story and once you
unlock Dracula&#8217;s Castle it is huge.</p>

<p>The combat is deep. I love all the different glyphs and glyph
unions. The combat system is fun to execute through the entire
game, because you are always getting more weapons and spells and
facing new /kinds/ of enemies.</p>

<p>The quests are actually fun! The quest system in Portrait of Ruin
was a little too tedious and boring, but these quests worked,
because they were a little more directed and you were likely to
run across one of the items requested as you progressed, so you
knew what to do to get everything. Thus, I completed them all.</p>

<p>The extra dungeons were a challenge, but not too insane! I don&#8217;t
normally do the insane enemy rooms (like the Arena from Aria of
Sorrow), but I did do the Large Cavern, because I felt like the
rest of game&#8217;s combat mechanics prepared you for dealing with so
many foes. In past games, I felt like the only way to beat them
was to grind an insane amount and get massive amounts of
potions. This game, I didn&#8217;t really grind at all (I did a little
bit to get some of the more interesting glyph and item
drops&#8212;like Arma Felix, so cool!)</p>

<p>I recommend this game, no reservations!</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/16/Game--Sin-and-Punishment--N64--2000--0/">Game: Sin and Punishment (N64, 2000)</a></h1>
<time datetime="2009-12-16T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate><span class='month'>Dec</span> <span class='day'>16</span> <span class='year'>2009</span></time>
<div class="entry-content"><p>For almost the past two months, I have been playing Sin and
Punishment: Hoshi no Keishōsha every day. In the beginning, I
could only get through about 15 minutes of the game, so it fit
well into my rotation. As I got towards the end, I would play
every day, get to right before the final boss and die, losing
about 45 minutes of my life every time. But! I loved it so much!
It is so satisfying to play this game and slowly get better at
getting through each boss, each segment; learning how to get more
and more enemies and points. At times I feel like I&#8217;m playing a
beautiful piano piece that I&#8217;ve practiced for so long.</p>

<p>When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t know about the sword or that you
could knock back projectiles at enemies, so once I learned I
quickly got past some of my previous bottlenecks. My favourite
part of the game is when you control Airan: running through the
ship with her, fighting Leda, going on the chase, and destroying
the fleet is just so&#8230; EPIC! Then, the subway sequence is really
fun, but honestly, not as cool as the ship sequence. The first and
second parts with Saki are fine, but the side-scrolling final
stage is awesome. The difficulty in the game is perfect. Even
though I got through the final boss on my first try, it was insane
and frenetic. I ended with about 564 hit points left on the Earth,
which started around 30k, so I clearly didn&#8217;t do an amazing
job. But it was awesome.</p>

<p>The music is great for its era (although wifey reports that she
got pretty tired of it.) The visuals hold up very well actually,
because everything is so big. Ya, the textures in the backgrounds
are really blurry, but it actually gives an apocalyptic and fast
paced feel. The controls are really smooth&#8230; although I didn&#8217;t
play on a N64 controller. (I used the best controller ever aka
arcade stick. I mapped the top three buttons to: strafe left,
fire, strafe right, lock-on/manual. Then the bottom left button to
jump so that I just laid my hand down and never had to move it. I
feel like the game was easier this way because I used more digits
than the N64 controller would &#8220;fit.&#8221;) I love the pacing and the
simple (but interesting) scoring system.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for the sequel, Sin and Punishment: Sora no Kōkeisha
to come out. If it doesn&#8217;t make it over, I&#8217;ll definitely have to
import a Japanese Wii or something to play it. I heart it.</p>

<p>Now the final business: My score. I played on Easy for this first
play-through. (I will do Normal soon.) I got 44,214,705 points,
spent 46 minutes and 41 seconds and got 2033 enemies. This is all
on one credit, of course.</p>

<p>Love it!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night and tonight I played Wonder Boy for the Sega Master
System. I used to play Adventure Island on my original NES, so
when I learned that Wonder Boy was its root, I just had to play
it.</p>

<p>This game destroyed me. It is so hard. There are so many times
where your timing just has to be insanely perfect. I really
enjoyed beating it though. I didn&#8217;t get all the dolls (so as I
read on Wikipedia, I didn&#8217;t get to go to the 10th level.) I ended
up with a score of 408,380. The high score for the MAME version is
<a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=46&amp;gi=6946&amp;vi=7899">2,122,630</a>, but my score would be number 8; assuming that the SMS
version is basically the same. (That tells me that it is not an
active board.)</p>

<p>I used lots of save states and I don&#8217;t think I got all the dolls,
i.e., didn&#8217;t get to level 10.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Wifey and I just beat World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck for the Genesis. This is a two player platformer
released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. It is really fun that you
have to cooperate with another person: sometimes you need to stand
on each other&#8217;s shoulders, pull the other player through a small
hole, or use a handcar together. There is also friendly fire in
the game, which is definitely exciting and forces you to really
communicate.</p>

<p>We played through all but the final level in one go a few weeks
ago, but we lost all our tries right near the end and waited until
tonight to finish it. We got back through all those parts and to
the final boss, but he creamed us up front. The problem was that
we didn&#8217;t know where to attack him. This is typical of this game:
it does a very poor job communicating to you what you need to do
to advance. For example, there are these doors in the final area
that are very hard to open because you don&#8217;t know what button to
press. Simple, but annoying.</p>

<p>Overall, the game is a nice quick platforming experience and I
think my wife liked it; and that&#8217;s saying something! I can&#8217;t wait to
play through the new Super Mario Brothers for the Wii with her.</p>

<p>We used Save States in the final area to conserve lives, but beat
the final boss on one try.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I&#8217;ve been playing this for the NES. Of course,
I played that game a lot when I was growing up, but I had never
beat it or experienced every level. It remains fun and challenging
to this day. When I started playing, I didn&#8217;t remember that you
needed to go through particular paths in many of the castles, so
that was a really fun challenge this time around. The final castle
in particular is a pain in the neck with all the different
pipes. I was really excited to finally save Princess Toadstool;
she&#8217;s been waiting a long time for me.</p>

<p>I used save states and got a score of 443900 with 23 coins and 7
extra lives. There is a save state at the start screen of the

<div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished playing Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo on the PC
Engine CD.</p>

<p>This game is /amazing/. The levels are all so unique and
interesting. They are all challenging and the boss are
particularly frustrating, but totally satisfying and fun. I loved
being able to play as Maria after I rescued her. I can&#8217;t wait to
play Symphony of the Night again and pay attention to the
interactions with Maria. The game is definitely easier with her. I
only played with her through the alternate route and I beat
Dracula with both Richter and Maria. Naturally I also got 100%,
but I&#8217;d like to play it again sometime and go with Maria through
the primary route and Richter through the alternate route.</p></p>

<p>Update: One more thing. If you&#8217;ve played a Castlevania game,
you know how when you beat a boss, this magic sphere appears that
refills your health or advances you to the next level. I
/always/ jump to get it. It is so much fun!</p>

<p>I /absolutely/ recommend this game!</p>

<p>Finished with these paths:
Richter:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> Final
Prisoners: 2, 7</p>

<p>Maria:
1 -> 2&#8217; -> 3&#8217; -> 4&#8217; -> 5&#8217; -> 6 + Final
Prisoners: 3&#8217;, 4&#8217;</p>

really fun and there were a few parts of the game that were quite
challenging (mostly just in the final world.) As I played through,
I got about 90% of the captured Toads, because I liked to explore
each level. However, when I got to the final boss I found out I
couldn&#8217;t proceed until I got all the Toads. I wasn&#8217;t about to go
back through the game and do many levels again to get them, so I
didn&#8217;t finish the game. But for what I played it was a lot of fun
and I recommend it, but make sure you get all the Toads as you go,
otherwise you&#8217;re in for some frustration and annoyance.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>During my last trip, I played through this game. I thought the
environment was really fresh relative to the last few Castlevania
games I&#8217;ve played and I enjoyed the partner system a lot, although
I felt like I didn&#8217;t have as much use for <em>REDACTED</em>lotte; She seemed
too much like a support for Jonathan, rather than a character in
her own right. I&#8217;m really looking forward to playing the other
modes, but I don&#8217;t think I will for a while.</p>

<p>My memory card is too slow so it crashed a lot when I played to
the point where I couldn&#8217;t beat the final boss or fully explore
the last area. So I didn&#8217;t finish the game.</p>

practice every day. It is so much fun. I also bought a Mad Catz

others. Come to my house and I will show you its beauty!</p>

/amazing/. I can&#8217;t believe how beautiful and epic it is. I even
set up my TV to rotate into portrait so I could play it as it was

<p>The game is so difficult, but so rewarding at the same time. Every
new screen is totally different, yet totally builds on the simple
controls of the earlier parts of the game. I&#8217;m really impressed by
this game and can&#8217;t wait to try out some of the other shmups from
Treasure.</p>

<p>There are some amazing videos of it online: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JAnfdaU_Y">level 3 (perfect)</a> and

<div class="entry-content"><p>After playing /Aria/, I picked up this. I&#8217;d actually played it
once before at the start of graduate school, but I hadn&#8217;t touched
it since.</p>

<p>I really like this game. I think it takes a lot that was good
about /Aria/ and really refines it. The story is interesting and
the twist that every Castlevania game has was played out very
well. The world is interesting to explore and the Soul system has
definitely improved. One nice addition was the creation of the
Soul Synthesis/Weapon Upgrade system, which was a lot of fun to
play with and get everything. This was definitely easier for me
than /Aria/ though and I beat it in significantly less time. I do
plan on going through it again though either in Hard mode or with
the secret character.</p>

<p>There are a few things that are just hilarious in the game: the
Yeti, the Mothman, the Succubus animation, the Skeleton Waiters,
the relationship between Hammer and Yoko, etc. It really reminded
me of /Symphony of the Night/ with some of this extra
material that just added flavour.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>During the last little bit, I played and beat this for the
Nintendo GBA. This is definitely a good entry in the Castlevania
franchise. I really appreciated the variety that came from the
Soul system, but I felt like it had a problem that many RPGs with
these &#8220;collecting&#8221; systems: most of the things you collect are
totally useless. This game had two other problems in my mind:
first, the difficulty curve had a really sharp spike at one point
which required me to grind for almost two hours to get past a
boss; and second, the user interface was really poor and that
complicated switching souls quickly to navigate around the
map. Both of these were fixed in the next entry; in particular the
Doppelganger soul allowed you to have two equipment sets
readied.</p></p>

<p>I will definitely play this again as the secret character, so
maybe I&#8217;ll report back then.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>/Best game ever!/</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe how good this game is. Seriously. I&#8217;m in
shock. Play it; stop reading and play it now. I bought an Xbox 360
for the sole purpose of this game and don&#8217;t regret it at all.</p>

<p>I was worried that it would be too easy and I would get annoyed
(&#8216;cause I only like hard old-school games), so I played it on
Insane (the hardest difficulty) from the start. This mode was
clearly intended to be played after you had done a few
play-throughs and unlocked the golden weapons and gotten high
levels. Until the very end of the game when you get the Inertia
Element and the Fusion Helmet and you reach around level 40, the
game is basically a stealth game. Even with full health upgrades,
you can die almost instantaneously in most rooms. I loved this
though. The very next day after beating it at 100% map and 100%
items, I immediately started again. I love it.</p>

item you got is actually a key. It was frustrating to spend hours
wandering around looking for something that I could do that I

<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy VI</a> (GBA version) on the DS</p>

<p>I /loved/ this game when it first came out. I remember getting a
SNES for my birthday, but not having any games until Christmas
when I asked for /Final Fantasy III/ (as it was called in the
US&#8230; not that I knew that at the time.) When I finally got it, I
remember talking to a friend later on in the night about how I had
played all day and was already half way through.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t played the game in over ten years, but before then I
played it through many times. Well, this time it was just as
awesome. But rather than just gloat, I&#8217;ll mention some things I
like about it:
- The characters have real depth and it matters who is in your
party in most situations as they react differently.
- The characters have unique battle personas for most of the game,
due to their useful special commands; although sadly this
degrades a little bit in the end game when magic is essential
for everything.
- The world is interesting with many connections that you don&#8217;t
need to notice unless you care to look. For example, the woman
in love with the fallen soldier in Mobliz or Shadow&#8217;s dreams in
the World of Ruin.
- The final battle is very unique with multiple parties and
different tiers with different status effect carry overs.
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M">The Opera Scene</a> (and portions of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGpIWD39Ngw">remake</a> and a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NC45S948ss][live version
with the New Japan Philharmonic]]&#8212;definitely watch the live
version and after the original.)
- Speaking of that scene, the music is amazing.
- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCXGVNvtxkc">Imp</a>
- The multiple party dungeon system is neat, but see below.
- The split-up at the beginning of the game is very neat as well.</p>

<p>However, there are something I don&#8217;t like (and unfortunately not
many games have got them right either):
- In the end game, it feels like any party is just as good as
another because of magic.
- The multiple party dungeons are tedious when characters aren&#8217;t
equally leveled and the only way to get them there is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming">grind</a>),
which sucks.
- Gau, Mog, Relm, and Strago&#8217;s special commands are very cool when
you think about them but are very hard to use well. Gau in
particular requires <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/930370/50814">PhD to use well</a>.
- You can play the entire game and never see a [[http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Desperation_Attack][desperation
attack]]. (Before I read the FAQs, I had played the game three or
four times and only seen them twice.)</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do Dragon&#8217;s Den. I primarily used
Terra/Celes/Sabin/Mog->Umaro->Gogo</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favourite games ever is /Earthbound/ for the Super
Nintendo. A few years ago I heard about a sequel coming out for
the Gameboy Advance. I obsessively checked video game news sites
until it was clear that it was not going to come out in
America. Luckily, in the middle of October of this year, Mother 3
was translated by fans and a patch released for the GBA ROM.</p></p>

<p>I just finished playing and, man, it is awesome. It recreates the
feel of the original and pushes it up a few notches and adds a
whole bunch of unique stuff. I was very impressed and
satisfied.</p>

<p>What an amazing game. The story is very deep and compelling. The

good voice acting in a game that I can think of. The game play is
very fun and removes some of the annoying parts of most RPGs. The
music is great and either touching or exciting, whatever is
appropriate for the context. The graphics are beautiful,
particularly in the final boss battle. And then ending is truly
satisfying.</p>

<p>Even with this bumble, I can say that the story was cute and the
characters were interesting. Unfortunately, most of the songs were
pretty bad. There were two towards the end (the first when Preity
falls in love; and some other) that were actually good though.</p>

<p>Recommendation: Decent, but bear through the first few songs and
get a good copy.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Khushi stars Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Kapoor.</p>

<p>Story: The story was pretty cute and without some of the more
ridiculous things that happen in movies like this. The first five
minutes are particularly cheeseball though, so don&#8217;t be turned off
right away.</p>

<p><em>REDACTED</em>acters: The two characters are very lovable. And their
relationship is ultra-cute. Basically, they fight all the time
about little things&#8230; Kareena always mistakes what Fardeen means
and this is humourous. Kareena is also very difficult and gives
Fardeen pain in an amusing way. (I was very proud of myself when I
got what a surprised/confused/hurt face was about&#8211;Kareena made
Fardeen call her by the formal second person pronoun, /aap/,
rather than the informal, /tum/, that they used before a
fight. But I don&#8217;t think I should be proud, a billion Indians would
have gotten it when they were six.)</p>

<p>Costumes: Kareena&#8217;s outfits throughout the movie are great; not
/Devdas/ great, but good in a different way.</p>

<p>Songs: The first few songs were kind of bad and there&#8217;s
basically a Pepsi ad in the middle of the movie; but, the later
songs are really good &#8211; particularly the one when they dress up as
different people and after the hospital scene.</p>

<p>Overall: I thought it was good overall and can imagine renting it
again to show to someone.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Devdas stars Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, and Aishwarya Rai.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say much about the story, besides that it
/sounds/ very interesting from the DVD box blurb, but the
DVD I got did not have subtitles (and did not seem to be a bootleg
either.) However, the blurb was very detailed, so I was able to get
most of what was going on in the movie.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the dancing and music, particular the song /Dola
Re Dola/ (chapter 17 on the DVD.) I cannot stress how amazing it
is. It motivated me to go read about the different styles of Indian
dance, whereupon I found <a href="http://www.meissoun.ch/dlai/dlai-bw-artikel-e.htm">this article</a> that talks about the
different kinds in movies. It actually mentions that the dancing in
/Devdas/ is the Kathak style.</p>

<p>Recommendation: If you know Hindi, it&#8217;s probably fabulous. If
you can find a DVD with subtitles, it&#8217;s probably great. If not,
check out the songs. (And if I know you, I can show you the one
song I /really/ like.)</p>

<p>(More on the DVD: The DVD from Eros Entertainment is supposed to
be a special edition double-disc and is probably much better than
what I found, from the original producer.)</p>

<p>I thought the story, acting, and songs were great. Actually, the
songs were fabulous. I have a collection of CDs with songs from
Shahrukh movies, and I loved all the songs from this movie before I
saw it.</p>

<p>Shahrukh is handsome and well dressed in the movie, although he
reminds me a frog in general. Kajol was beautiful in the second
half and her wedding gowns were amazing. Rani was beautiful in the
beginning, although I think she looks better without her &#8220;modern
ideas.&#8221;</p>

great and I was on the edge of my seat, about to write the most

it very much, although I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose.</p>

<p>A note on the songs &#8211; the one Kareena dances is good, but most of
the others are not so good. But, the dancing in the club is great,
although a bit too provocative for my tastes.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Fida stars Kareena Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, and Jai Malhotra. Kareen
was amazing acting as a cold, heartless woman and was dressed very
well throughout the movie. Fardeen looked liked he was trying a bit
to hard to be &#8220;suave.&#8221; And, Jai portrayed a man crumbling and going
mad very well, through his transition from being cutesy in love, to
crazy with pain.</p>

<p>The story was interesting, but seemed to happen a bit too
quickly.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Dil Chahta Hai is very different than most of the Bollywood movies
I&#8217;ve seen so far. It is less silly, although still has many funny
moments. There is actually some intense dramatic action and sad
parts. Although not unique, one thing I liked was having no clue
how or if the couples would get together.</p>

<p>Preity Zinta was beautiful. Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna were very
good-looking.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I watched another good Bollywood movie, Dil To Pagal Hai. It stars
Karishma Kapoor, Kareena&#8217;s older sister, and Madhuri Dixit who
reminds me of Rani Mukherjee.</p>

<p>The movie is a fairly clever. The biggest disappointment with it
was that there was little tradition style outfits and dancing,
which has become my favourite aspect of these movies. Still it was
very cute, and Amanda cried at the end.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham&#8230; is another cute movie. It is really two
movies in one, however, the intermission could very easily be a gap
between two movies. Kajol is a new face for me.</p>

<p>According to imdb.com, it was the most expensive Indian film
ever as of 2001.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Mujhse Dosti Karoge! was my second Bollywood experience. Much
better than the first one. Hardly any sour points.</p>

<p>Rani Mukherjee is much cuter and better at acting than Kareena
Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan is actually very sweet and intense.</p>

<p>Kareena Kapoor is very attractive in this movie. But Hrithik Roshan
is a bit too annoying and plastic.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve beaten Xenosaga just the other day. It was a pretty good
game, although what was said about it being very much like a movie
is very true. Although it was certainly a good movie. perhaps one
of the annoying things about it as a game was that there was no
real need to utilize all your characters. After I had everyone I
just stuck with a particular grouping for the whole game.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In Kingdom Hearts, I&#8217;ve just about finished the game. I got to the
&#8220;Final Rest&#8221; before the last boss and then I left and tried to tie
up some loose ends. So far I&#8217;ve gotten all the synthesis items
(and thus Sora&#8217;s ultimate weapon) and now I&#8217;m working on beating
all the Coliseum cups alone &amp; with a time limit. I kind of don&#8217;t
want to finish the game because then I won&#8217;t have anything to
play. Maybe I&#8217;ll cave in, beat it, and go buy something&#8212;not sure
what though. I&#8217;m pretty happy I&#8217;m basically done and I started it
last week. :)</p>
