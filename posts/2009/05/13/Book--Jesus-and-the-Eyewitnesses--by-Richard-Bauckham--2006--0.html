Luke, and John) are collection of eyewitness testimonies. Bauckham
discusses ancient and modern historiography to show how such
gathering of testimony was (and is) common when writing this sort
of history. He places much emphasis on the inclusion of specific
names as a key to the origin of the particular testimony. His main
narrative is derived from Papias who writes that he is recording
stories that have been circulating and given by eyewitnesses,
because the original testators are slowly dying and the stories
must be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not really qualified to judge much of the book, so I skimmed
some of the more esoteric segments. The closing essay, "The Jesus
of Testimony" was particularly interesting. He starts with Kevin
Vanhoozer's technical definition of testimony: "Testimony is a
speech act in which the witness's very act of stating &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is
offered as evidence 'that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;,' it being assumed that the
witness has the relevant competence or credentials to state truly
'that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.'" [pg 473] Bauckham argues that we rely on
testimony "hundreds, probably thousands, of times a day in trivial
ways and in crucially important ways" [pg 474], so why should be
particular skeptical of testimony in historical contexts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long discussion of the reasonableness of trusting
testimony, Bauckham makes a long analogy between testimonies of the
Holocaust and the testimonies of Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;p&gt;Holocaust testimonies are not easily appropriated by the
historian, since they are prima facie scarcely credible and since
they defy the usual categories of historical
explanation. (*REDACTED*lotte Delbo said of new arrivals in Auschwitz
what is also true of any who read Holocaust testimonies: "They
expect the worst --- they do not expect the unthinkable.") This is
why the testimonies of survivors of the Holocaust are in the
highest degree necessary to any attempt to understand what
happened. The Holocaust is an event whose reality we could scarcely
begin to imagine if we had not the testimonies of survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, if we believe them, we also have to do with an
event "at the limits." The comparison is hazardous. In almost
everything except the sheer historical exceptionality of the event,
the Holocaust and the history of Jesus have nothing in common. Our
argument is in no way intended to detract from the particular
uniqueness of the Holocaust. On the contrary, we have to appreciate
this uniqueness if the case of the Holocaust is to teach us
anything about the role of testimony in other cases of
exceptionality in history. [pg 493]&lt;/p&gt;"

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a very interesting book that is a bit of
antidote to the general skepticism about the New Testament
Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2006/">2006</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
