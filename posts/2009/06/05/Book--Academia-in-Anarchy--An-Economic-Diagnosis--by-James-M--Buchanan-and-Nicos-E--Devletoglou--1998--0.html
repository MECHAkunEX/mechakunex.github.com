universities and research in an anarchist society. In fact, it is
an economic analysis of the chaos at universities in the 1960s,
such as those run by &lt;a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society_(1960_organization)"&gt;Students
for a Democratic Society&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, much of the analysis comes
down on the statist aspects of most universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is well summarized by the table of contents:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol
start="2"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Students: Consumers Who Do Not Buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faculties: Producers Who Do Not Sell&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Taxpayers: Owners
Who Do Not Control&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book basically argues that if students actually paid the
full cost of schooling, then they would have an incentive to buy
what they want and feel attached to the service and environment
they receive. One of main problems they suggest is that "with
university education ... all prospective consumers find themselves
in the curious situation of committing themselves in favor of a
product they do not know. University education is like a blind date
after all." [pg. 13] The book interestingly argues that tuition
support for education is highly regressive, because university
educated individuals are highly paid over the course of their life
relative to the non-university educated. [pg. 25]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the book argues that faculty should be paid on the
basis of the service they provide to students and rent their
supplies, offices, classrooms, etc from the university. For
example, if faculty were paid based on student-hours of teaching,
there would be an incentive to teach rather than an incentive to
slack. One of the other perverse aspects of the university that the
book discusses is that the policies are set by committees, but
committees are made up of those who do not excel at the other
aspects of the university (teaching and research), because they
impose high costs on those activities, so the rules are made by the
most incompetent faculty members. [pg. 55]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the book argues that taxpayers and boards should either
enforce their ownership or get out of the game. The authors suggest
that perhaps they do not because &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt; is not the good
that taxpayers are buying, instead &lt;em&gt;education funding&lt;/em&gt; is
the good. That is, &lt;em&gt;education funding&lt;/em&gt; itself, regardless of
outcome, is a good, because it is the moral thing to do. [pg. 71] I
think this matches the veiled opinions of many people I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book is definitely dated, but contains lots of gems
applicable to today.&lt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1998/">1998</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
