Punishment: Hoshi no Keishōsha every day. In the beginning, I
could only get through about 15 minutes of the game, so it fit
well into my rotation. As I got towards the end, I would play
every day, get to right before the final boss and die, losing
about 45 minutes of my life every time. But! I loved it so much!
It is so satisfying to play this game and slowly get better at
getting through each boss, each segment; learning how to get more
and more enemies and points. At times I feel like I'm playing a
beautiful piano piece that I've practiced for so long.

When I started playing, I didn't know about the sword or that you
could knock back projectiles at enemies, so once I learned I
quickly got past some of my previous bottlenecks. My favourite
part of the game is when you control Airan: running through the
ship with her, fighting Leda, going on the chase, and destroying
the fleet is just so... EPIC! Then, the subway sequence is really
fun, but honestly, not as cool as the ship sequence. The first and
second parts with Saki are fine, but the side-scrolling final
stage is awesome. The difficulty in the game is perfect. Even
though I got through the final boss on my first try, it was insane
and frenetic. I ended with about 564 hit points left on the Earth,
which started around 30k, so I clearly didn't do an amazing
job. But it was awesome.

The music is great for its era (although wifey reports that she
got pretty tired of it.) The visuals hold up very well actually,
because everything is so big. Ya, the textures in the backgrounds
are really blurry, but it actually gives an apocalyptic and fast
paced feel. The controls are really smooth... although I didn't
play on a N64 controller. (I used the best controller ever aka
arcade stick. I mapped the top three buttons to: strafe left,
fire, strafe right, lock-on/manual. Then the bottom left button to
jump so that I just laid my hand down and never had to move it. I
feel like the game was easier this way because I used more digits
than the N64 controller would "fit.") I love the pacing and the
simple (but interesting) scoring system.

I cannot wait for the sequel, Sin and Punishment: Sora no Kōkeisha
to come out. If it doesn't make it over, I'll definitely have to
import a Japanese Wii or something to play it. I heart it.

Now the final business: My score. I played on Easy for this first
play-through. (I will do Normal soon.) I got 44,214,705 points,
spent 46 minutes and 41 seconds and got 2033 enemies. This is all
on one credit, of course.

Love it!</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Sin &amp; Punishment/">Sin &amp; Punishment</a></li><li><a href="/cat/N64/">N64</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2000/">2000</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
