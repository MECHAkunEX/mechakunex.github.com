I started in the first Mission and did the set up in about twenty
minutes. The back row is pretty fortified (all +2) but the middle
had a nice Farm with potential heavy cover that I was going to
designate as the AP, but the first row had a hill that I'll plan
on using to put my FO or HMG.

My plan is to use 2 PLT to get that position. 1 PLT will get a
Village and 3 PLT advance on the flank. We'll see how it goes!

= M1: Turn 1

I moved 1/3 to the Village, 2/1 to the Hedge, 2/2 to the Hill, and
3/3 to the Marsh. The first two were hit by incoming artillery and
mortar. I got two Cs and 1 F. Yikes!

At least the other two didn't have Contact and I got 4 XP for
clearing the first row.

= M1: Turn 2

I moved 2 PLT forward into the clear space and spotted the Mtr
Spotter and laid Heck on him.

1 PLT HQ rescued his troops by going into the Village, commanding
them to grab the Casualty and then do a PLT Move back to the
staging area and then Rallied them back together.

3 PLT was safe and advanced forward.

I got a lot of General Initiative, so 3/3 and 2/2 moved forward
and sought cover.

The 2/2 spotted a Patrol squad and during combat, they got an
unlucky draw and were reduced to two Fire Ts and a Casualty. Nice!

= M1: Turn 3

Everyone moved forward, especially since the Mtr Spotter is out of
missions and disappeared. Heck will be brought down on the Germany
Squad out there, but to be safe, 3 PLT stayed behind while 3/3
took the Initiative and Concentrated their fire.

One of the Fire Teams moved back though! But the one that remained
was reduced to a Litter.

= M1: Turn 4

There was Trouble on the Flank, so I couldn't move forward. This
is really annoying because I want to capture those enemies. At
least, I can send reinforcements. Nothing much interesting could
be done though... stupid HQ! No use for my Initiative either!

Luckily, they didn't take their C and move back. Phew!

Very quick turn.

= M1: Turn 5

Ugh, stupid HQ. They demand a report.

1/3 went forward. 2/2 and 2/3 went forward. 3/2 moved as
well. Should be a nice amount of fun!

[I just realized the Fire Team that fell back would have gone off
the map. Nice!]

Capture a Casualty and a Litter.

The A contact ended up being a Sniper in the same spot as
2/2. Weird! Hopefully that will help.  The other two were No
Contact, which is nice, but the third ended up being an HMG on a
Hill. Luckily, it is in LOS of my HMG, so we'll have a bit of a
battle, plus I'll start a fire mission next turn!

In combat, the HMG and its target were Pinned, but my 1/2 got a
paralyzed unit. Yikes!

I ended up with a lot of XP for this turn because I got four PCs
cleared as well as the prisoners and the HQ event. Nice!

= M1: Turn 6

The XO tried to call in a fire mission on the HMG through the Arty
FO, but failed, ugh. Luckily, the 1 SGT had a lot of commands and
activated everybody else, then commanded the 1/1 to spot the
sniper and succeeded and sent the 1/1 into the Woods, knowing
they'd be targeted by enemy Arty. The 3 PLT moved up and put some
Mortar fire on the HMG, while the 2 PLT HQ held put. Finally the 1
PLT HQ did a similar rescue and got his Paralyzed team into a
Litter and got them out.

[I was a little skeptical of these heroic HQs, so I read the rules
and found out that you can't move when Exposed, so you can't move
twice, D'oh!. I'll stop doing that!]

The Sniper fled back into a Hedge while the Arty launched on the
1/1. The HMG was so shaken that it couldn't move. Nice!

Luckily, no contact in those Woods.

= M1: Turn 7

The XO failed again to bring in fire support on the HMG. Lame! He
did, however, spot the Sniper from up on his hill. The 1 SGT
activated everyone then rallied the Litter and commanded it into
the Woods. The 1 PLT moved in the Woods and Rallied the 1/1. The 3
PLT launched another Mortar attack. The 2 PLT moved into the Hedge
under Sniper fire, knowing that it would retreat now that it was
spotted, laying down a Phone Line on the way out. While there, he
tried to Rally his P unit, but failed.  Under their own
initiative, a Fire Team took a Casualty back to the CP, while the
P unit tried to recover again and failed.

The enemy sniper retreated while the enemy HMG continued to hold
their position and take our attack, which Paralyzes it and knocks
it out.

= M1: Turn 8

1 SGT commanded the Fire Team to go back to 1 PLT who commanded it
to join the 1/3 and advance into Obj 1. 2 PLT moved south and
tried Rally his P unit to a Litter then a Fire, then sent it
north. He plans to reunite next turn. 3 PLT moved into Obj 2 with
the 2/3. On their own initiative, the Fire joined the 2/2, while
the 1/3 sought cover.

The 1/3 had contact with the 3/Mtr Spotter and took some fire and
ended up with a Litter team.

= M1: Turn 9

The CO called the 1st SGT to run the troops. The 3rd had nothing
to do. The 2nd moved back and tried to spot the 3/Mtr, but
couldn't. Meanwhile, the 1st did spot him. No one was able to take
any initiative, unfortunately.

The enemy launched another Arty attack, and thus spent his ability
and left. This dismantled the 1/3 into a P and an F,
ouch. Luckily, the Litter team was missed.

= M1: Turn 10

As each unit reported back what happened in the previous turn, 1
PLT HQ moved forward and rallied all his troops back into the
1/3. Everyone else held their position and the day was won.

= M1: Close-out

I ended up with 3 casualties and 34 XP. Nice! Here's what I
bought:
| 34 | Co HQ to L         | 33 |
| 33 | Co XO to L         | 32 |
| 32 | 1 PLT HQ to L      | 31 |
| 31 | 2 PLT HQ to L      | 30 |

| 29 | 3/1 to V           | 23 |
| 23 | 2/2 to V           | 17 |
| 17 | 3/2 to V           | 11 |
| 11 | 1/3 to V           |  5 |
|  5 | Skill: NCO - GI    |  3 |
|  3 | Skill: NCO - P-&gt;F  |  2 |
|  2 | Skill: Training    |  1 |
|  1 | Skill: Trained Eye |  0 |

= Thoughts

This was a totally awesome experience. It was very tense and even
though I won, I had lots of difficult decisions and fretting. It
was very cool! I think I only broke the rules a little bit. It's
amazing that I played for five and a half hours for one session!
