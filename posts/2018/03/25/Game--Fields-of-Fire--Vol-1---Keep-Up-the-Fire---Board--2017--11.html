I'm experimenting this time with a card-less version with less
randomness, based on my analysis of the probabilities last time. I
also don't quite understand the combat patrol concept, so I'll
multiplying it by three because I don't want to play three times
on the same map.

= M3: Turn 1

Each platoon sent a squad forward. Two of three had contact
(contact is more likely in this variant) but were missed by the
respective attacks... which were mines and mortars.

= M3: Turn 2

We pushed our advance forward once more, ignoring the right two
columns of the board. The 3/2 hit two enemy squads while the 1/1
was detected by an enemy artillery spotter who successfully
launched a mission. Luckily, because it was a very dark night,
neither team was hit.

= M3: Turn 3

The 1st and 3rd moved forward and spotted the squads attacking the
2nd, then opened up on them. The 1st SGT called for fire missions
against one of them, given that they were on a targeted spot. On
their own initiative, the 1/Mtr launched at its target and
succeeded!

The enemy 1/1 launched a grenade! Ouch! The E3/2 looked for cover
and failed. The E1/1 got hit for a FLP. My 3/2 got hit for a FLP
also. Same with the E3/2.

= M3: Turn 4

My mortar team moved so I can't use the 81mm this turn. The 1st
SGT brought his team of MGs to the 1 PLT and took the opportunity
to launch a mortar on the enemy squad ahead. The 1st sent the 1/1
into one of the objectives and concentrated fire on the enemy in
front of them to wipe them out. The XO called in another fire
mission. The 3rd launched a grenade attack with their 3/AT. The
2nd held until they could advance.

One German Fire team fell back while another Litter team
rallied. One set had no ill effects, while a P became a C and an L
became a P.

= M3: Turn 5

The XO got another fire mission in. The 1st moved forward and the
3rd launched grenade attacks. The 1st SGT used concentrate fire on
the Germans as did the 3rd.

The enemy got a fall back order, but were all pinned. We knocked
out all the Germans. Woo!

= M3: Turn 6

The CO HQ rallied the units that fell back to him. The 2nd moved
his whole team forward and reconstituted the 3/2. The 1st sent the
1/1 to capture the Germans and the 3rd did the same with the
1/3. The 1/1 found cover.

The enemy tried to fall back again, but was stuck. We captured
them, yes! We also secured all the objectives.

The 1/1 ran into the E2/1 and E2/2 (with the 3/HMG). The 1/3 ran
into the E1/2 and E3/2. Ouch! The both missed my guys, nice.

= M3: Turn 7

The CO HQ spotted the squad &amp; the HMG and ordered a fire mission
on them. 1st SGT spotted the squad in the trenches as well as the
one in front of the 1/3. The 1st shifted towards the E1/2 and
launched a bazooka attack on their position. The 2nd launched a
mortar on the E2/2. The 3rd launched at the E1/2.

Combat was not too bad. Everyone got Pinned, except for the E2/2,
which got FLP.

= M3: Turn 8

The XO called in a Cannon. The 1st SGT concentrated fire. The 1st
launched their last mortar. The 3rd launched one as well. The E1/2
got hit for a FLP, while most of the other Germans were
missed. Ouch.

= M3: Turn 9

My battalion needs me to move forward this round... why!? I just
sent one guy forward for no reason. The XO and CO HQ both launched
fire missions on the E3/HMG. The 1/AT got a bazooka attack
out. The 2nd launched a mortar as well and concentrated their
fire. The 3rd did as well and sent the 3/AT forward (to attack the
HMG on their own initiative.)  Unfortunately, they missed.

One German fire team ran away. The HMG got blasted. 

= M3: Turn 10

I just have to hold one for one more turn! I'm almost out of
ammo. 1st SGT concentrated fire. The 1/AT attacked. The 2/Mtr
attacked. The 3/Mtr did too. 

I didn't simulate the combat on the enemies, since it wouldn't
have any effect.

= M3: Close-Out

No casualties! Nice! I didn't have much to spend my XP on.

= Thoughts

I suspected that my revisions to the game would make it easier,
but I still found it really hard. The main thing that was not hard
was that I always had enough commands to do whatever I
wanted. Maybe it would make more sense to have 2 on even round and
3 on odd rounds. I think it might have also been better if a
Weapon team didn't immediately become a Litter... in particular,
because there's no reason to upgrade them if that's the rule. I
think the right thing is to realize that they are a V/L/G unit so
should be F/L/P if they are hit. It definitely took less time,
which was one of my goals. Only about four hours, rather than six!
