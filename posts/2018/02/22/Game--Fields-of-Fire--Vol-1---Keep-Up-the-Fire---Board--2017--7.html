get an automatic H VOF, it only happens once, and needs to be
commanded by an observer in command. I think that I may prefer to
have separate Mortar teams so I can have more attacks on the field
at once.

A: Re phone wire --- BB 1 says there are 4 unassigned, but 4.3.4
in the rules says that there are at most 8 in the company. In
Vietnam, it says you get all 8, so I believe this was an error in
his play-through.

= Turn 1
- He has all the command units in the middle (with the Jeep) and
then the various Platoons on each of the bottom cards in the
staging area.

- He uses his one command to activate 1st PLT, but I think he
should have done the XO or 1st Sgt to have a chance to get more
PLTs active.

- He uses one Squad at a time to advance (given that there's no
advantage to moving forward.) Uses the one with the Rifle
Grenade.

= Turn 2
- 1st SGT is always better to activate because he starts as
Veteran and doesn't suffer the draw penalty and actually has a
bonus.

- Moves the entire PLT forward because the coast is clear (for
now) and continues advance with the scouting squad. (Does this
with 1st PLT also.)

- He wasted 2nd PLT's command but could have searched for Cover
and then Exhorted if necessary. Actually, he does this with his
general initiative, which implies he thinks he can't do it
otherwise... Ah, I thought that Visual-Verbal communication was
based on LOS, but it is actually on the same card, so ya, he
couldn't've.

- I didn't draw for the Unit Placement when I played, like he did,
because it says something about placement in the package
table. But I now see that the table is not the default (says so
in 9.2.1.)

= Turn 3
- He still doesn't use his commands on CO Staff for some
reason. Maybe because the 1st Sgt doesn't have a phone, so he
can't communicate with the PLT HQs... but the XO would be able
to.

- It is interesting that any unit can perform a Spot and if they
succeed, then other units see the enemy even if they were not
the one doing the spot.

- When I played, I didn't run the Enemy Activity checks. Whoops!
