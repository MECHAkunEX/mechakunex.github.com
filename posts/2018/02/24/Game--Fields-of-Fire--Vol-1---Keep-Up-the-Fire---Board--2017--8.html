- I didn't learn much from this turn.

= Turn 5
- Again, didn't learn much. I think I'll stop watching for a bit
and try again.

----------------

Actually, I decided to look at the Counter Attack video series
first.

= Turn 1
- The use of plexiglass is interesting and it is interesting to
see how this guy organizes things differently. In particular, he
uses talks about the choice of radio vs phone and goes with
radio.

- He starts off with two Runners in his inventory, but in my
briefing book it doesn't say that. Ah, but 4.3.2 says that you
always have two Runners with the CO HQ.

- Rather than moving an entire PLT, he just sends a single Assault
Team in... very interesting. It doesn't seem like a good idea to
me, because the worse that could happen would be that one dying
and not generating any fire, but the PLT would work the same way
but continue to make fire if it were hit. Maybe a good thing is
that an A result is common.

= Turn 2
- One strategy that could be good is to have an extra radio for
each squad that you can send with a scout so they can get
orders, then when the coast is clear, take it back and transfer
it to a different unit. It doesn't seem like there are enough of
them to go around though. :(

= Turn 3
- This was interesting, but no notes.

= Turn 4
- He should have activated the 1st SGT and then used that to
activate the 3rd PLT HQ.

= Turn 5
- He made a mistake. His Pinned unit should have been Unpinned
because there was a MISS in the combat.

= Turn 6
- I feel like he made a mistake on the Farm because it looks like
something is under the Cover marker so the US troops wouldn't
fire into the Friendly area. (Ya, he said this.)

= Turn 7
- He expended ammo on a Grenade Miss, which is something I was
confused about.

- I noticed that he should have moved the XO to that spot.

= Turn 8
- The Cease Fire, then start again, is a very strange rule.

= Turn 9

= Turn 10
- It seems like there's a ton of experience available after the
battle.

----------------

I think I'm ready to try and play for myself again!
