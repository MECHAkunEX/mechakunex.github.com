up, then I played a round and a half. I learned a lot about what
NOT to do and how complex the game is.

Basically, I equally distributed everything and moved everyone
forward in the first turn (1st PLT going into the 1st open card
and so on.) This was a really bad idea as there was basically no
advantage to having many of the same guys on the same spot (unless
I did it wrong.) Basically, the maximum VOF I was doing was just
-1 or -2 and the other side ripped into every single one of my
guys, who was exposed and not in cover. I lost nearly half the
company in that first interaction.

I found it really confusing what happens, though, when a token is
hit. The paralyzed marker looks like it goes on top of another
token, like the Pinned, but then on the other hand it also looks
like maybe the whole unit goes away. I am going to watch the
tutorial video again.

Notes for next time
- I need to activate the XO and 1st SGT so I can potentially get
even more moves using them.
- There doesn't seem to be any reason to bring more than one unit
on to a spot.
- I forgot to do the Enemy Activity Check, I think because I
didn't see where the table was.
- I thought that the row closest to me was Row 3, not Row 1, so
the enemies were rank B rather than rank C. Yikes!
