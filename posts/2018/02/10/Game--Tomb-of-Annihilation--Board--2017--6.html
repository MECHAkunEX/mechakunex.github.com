Adventure 10: This was a really hard one. Wow. The boss was really
bad. It got three 20s in a row on me and since it can just keep
attacking again and again, it was really hard.

After GP: 1400gp

Adventure 11: This one was pretty easy, as I got lucky draws on
the Dungeon Tiles.

After GP: 2900gp

In between: I bought another "Regain 2 HP" token.

After GP: 1400gp

Adventure 12: This was surprisingly easy, because you can avoid
the Juggernaut pretty easily. It was a cool concept though,
because the rules were a lot different than other ones.

After GP: 2700gp

In between: A "+2 Attack" token.

After GP: 1200gp

Adventure 13: This was surprisingly easy because I had so many
powerful attacks and I could use Recharge to get them back
immediately.

After GP: 1600gp

Overall, I feel like this game started off really fun and tense,
but the characters got too powerful too quickly. There were so
many powers and options available, but in general there was never
much of a reason to use more than one or two of them. It is a very
clever system of searching through the Dungeon Tile deck and
populating the map with enemies based on what they say. But, the
scenarios were not tuned well. I enjoyed it, but I think it is too
expensive for the enjoyment. (It clocked in a $5 per hour for
me. If I played it again and it took the same amount of time, it
would be $2.30, which is still on the expensive side given my rate
of playing most video games.)

I highly doubt that I will play through the game again using the
other characters, at least not solo. Perhaps my kids will want to
play eventually. I know, at least, that they will have fun playing
with the figures.
