epic. It is so ridiculous and terrible when Slynt shows up. It
makes me really frustrated listening to him.

I can't believe how terrible Shae is to Tyrion and how blind-sided
he is by it. I think this is done a little bit better in the show,
but she is more vicious in the book. The description of the fight
is really cool and intense.

I like Dany's capture of Mereen and I liked her conversations with
the captains. Ser Barristan has a good explanation of why he wants
to serve her. It is sad how much she regrets sending Jorah away
right off.

It is really cute that the best part of being king for Tommen is
that he gets to use the wax seal. That's such an 8-year-old thing
to love. There are so many people changing their seats, it is a
cool way to show the effects of the war. I don't understand why the
Westerlings were pardoned. I wonder what they did. The fake Arya is
really comic and I'm surprised that he helps Brienne about that. I
like the subtle hints of what Stannis is doing. I can't tell if
Cersei really loves Jaime or is trying to use her sexuality on him;
given that she is so cruel when he denies her, I think it is the
former. I love the final lines of this chapter about him writing
his own history.

Jon's rapport with Tormund is great. I think it is a bit more epic
in the show when he goes to Mance Raydor of his own will rather
than being forced to. The mythology of the Horn is really cool,
especially because we don't see that it is actually used. I like
that the Wildlings try to get through with a suicide pact. The
description of Stannis' attack is pretty cool.

Arya's scene finding everyone in the inn is awesome and I love that
she has Needle back. It is cute that she mostly forgives The
Hound. They really extending out their time together in the show,
which is a general thing about this one book being pulled out into
two seasons. It is so epic the way she gets to Braavos though.

Sam's summary of the battle and of Stannis' troops was fun,
especially his observations about the Kingsmen versus the
Queensmen. There is so much more plodding and drama about the
voting process.

I don't like how some of my favorite things about Jon are no longer
his ideas and choices. For example, Stannis is much more committed
to helping the Wildlings and fighting the Others than Jon
is. I do think it works better for him to be tempted with
Winterfell before he becomes Lord Commander.

Tyrion's story with Taisha seems to pretty to be revealed at this
time. I feel like he and Jaime have more to talk about maybe, but I
guess the idea is that Jaime thinks he'll never see him. It doesn't
make sense that Tyrion wouldn't be honest with Jaime about not
killing Joffrey. His sneaking around was a lot of fun.

I loved Stannis' harassment of the candidates, but again I dislike
that he gets the credit for giving the Wildlings the gift. His
plans to hold the Nightfort and so on is very interesting... he is
so much more committed. I like that the dragon-glass mining will be
under way. I wonder how Aemon thinks Lightbringer is faked and what
he expects the real thing to be like. Sam's politicking and tricks
were a lot of fun, especially his different versions of what made
Jon a good choice.

Jon's vision of home and his plans for the kids was very adorable,
as was when he was reunited with Ghost. It was very sweet. I loved
the way that Moormont's raven was used---very cool. The ending was
great.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2000/">2000</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
