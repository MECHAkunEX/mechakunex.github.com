Old Nan. You really get the impression that he liked her a lot that
and that she made a huge impression on him. I like that no one
really understood what happened with Hodor, although it was pretty
cool in the show when everyone was freaked out.

Jon's conversations with Ygritte are so awesome. I love how she
talked about using her knife against any man that was mean to
her. Her mom's advice, "A man can own a knife or a woman, but not
both." Hah! I love that everyone calls the people south of the
Wall, "Kneelers". It was neat that Summer helped saved Jon.

All the guys on the opposite side that Dany met were so gross and
awful. It was great. Her terms to Yunkai were pretty cool, but I
like the way that Dario was shown off in the show. Her telling off
of Jorah was brutal!

Arya's story had a lot more conversation and exposition about other
people and houses. Her capture by the Hound was great too. The
really shown that he was hanging around the camp waiting for
something too.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2000/">2000</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
