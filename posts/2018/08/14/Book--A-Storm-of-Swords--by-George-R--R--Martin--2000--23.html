how grim she felt about her own feelings and wish fulfillment. It
seemed too easy for her to notice that the stone was missing and
not reasonable for her to think it was the poison, but I see how it
is good for the book to have a justification of some sort.

Jaime arrives at a very different time. I like that Loras and
Brienne have a bit of a confrontation. The scene in the sept is a
lot different and he is much more angry with Tywin. The plan to
have Tommen be his squire seems really odd as Tommen would be the
king in Tywin's plan.

Davos is much more cunning in the book, as he needs a lot of people
to work together to save Storm. I don't really understand why he is
so focused on the North when he has so little faith in Melissandre.

Jon is much less heroic in the book and basically becomes in charge
of the way by pure accident. Of course, he leads the defense well
but he doesn't show the moral virtue to his brothers that he does
in the show. There's no mutineers to recapture; his leg is hurt so
he can't show his martial valor; etc. There is definitely way more
Wildling force, which is interesting, though.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2000/">2000</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
