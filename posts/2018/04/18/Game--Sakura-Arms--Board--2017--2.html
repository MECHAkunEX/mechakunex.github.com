Yukihi --- Her umbrella state switches between different
attacks. Closed attacks from mid-range, while Open stacks from
very close range. Closed in general is a defensive posture (can
move further back), while Open is the aggressive one. Gentle Snow
is very useful with a closed umbrella because you can get back as
many times as you want. Abrupt Transformation lets you surprise
switching states. In general, lots of attacks.

Shinra --- A few attacks that are very wide range, but mostly
deals status effects. Prove the Nature is a really weird
card... when combined with Infer the Totality though, then you can
avoid dying, but it doesn't seem like it will do a lot of damage.

Oboro --- Playing a discard Trap seems like it could be useful,
especially with Caltrop and Steel Strings. This would synergize
well with Yukihi, who attacks from a similar range. Kuma-Suke
(attack a number of times equal to Discard cards) could be pretty
powerful, especially at the short range.

Yurina --- She has a really wide range and Spirit of Fire is a
great thing to do at the end when your life is low. Very powerful
attacks as Specials.

Saine --- Silent Wall is pretty essential as a way to keep nothing
on your Aura but still defend. Rhythmic Arc is definitely
powerful.

Himika --- Long distance attacks and very cheap Specials.

Tokoyo --- Very defensive with almost no attacks. Very good at the
mid-range and essential to have Vigor 2 because of the special
trait.

Hmm, that was interesting. I'm excited to play again.
