I
was also surprised that Darkstar attacked Myrcella and even more
surprised that she didn't die! The ending reveals in this chapter
were very cool... Ariane was to marry Viserys and he's sent his
eldest son off to Mereen to see Dany. She's got a lot of people on
their way to visit her.

Sansa's babying of Robyn is very odd. She is fulfilling her part
really well... thinking of herself as Alayne, calling Littlefinger
"Father", and so on. She's having a training that is similar to
Arya's... learning to hide as someone else. She is also getting to
experience what it is like to be a bastard like Jon. I feel like in
the show, she's never actually treated like Petyr's daughter so you
don't get this. I wonder what Petyr means by the "Three
Queens"---Cersei and Dany and .... maybe her as Queen in the North?
His plan to marry her to Harry is so awesome and such a great deal
for Sansa.

The meeting between Brienne and Lady Stoneheart was intense. It is
interesting that she has taken over the Brothers without
Banners. Her fever dreams were very strange. I wonder what the word
she shouted was. Cat is so stupid... hurting one of her biggest
defenders.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
