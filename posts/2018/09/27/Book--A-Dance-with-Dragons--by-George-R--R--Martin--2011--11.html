She sees Tyrion and saves
him, but has no idea who he is or why he's there. Drogon appears to
come for no reason and there's no threat to Dany, but she puts him
under her control and flies off. The show works much better on this
one.

Jon's interaction with Val is so neat... I feel like they are
building her as a love interest for when he comes back to
life. Shireen is much kinder than the queen and it is surprising
that Val is so opposed to her. I like the idea of hundreds of
giants and mammoths being around. It is cute that Jon thinks of
Arya. And I love the way that Jon has thought of all sorts of
different ways to constrain the free folk and how he defends them
to the other brothers.

I was quite surprised to hear from Cersei. She is just so totally
defeated, but her confession is very useful to her. The news she
gets from Kevan is interesting and it is cool that Qyburn's
Champion will be revealed.

Baristan's take on the king taking over and the events of what
happened after Dany left was fascinating. I love his perspective,
because he knows so many things in Westeros. I like his knights and
the way that we know that Hizdar tried to kill Dany.

I have a hard time being excited about Victarian, although it is
nice and tense to think about what he will do when he arrives in
Mereen with no Dany to court. I wonder if this Red Priest is the
same one that was with Tyrion?

I love how Tyrion takes charge of every situation he finds himself
in. His interaction with the Second Sons was great and I like him
speculating about how he would have dealt with the siege for Dany.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
