I like his
conclusion: "If you want to conquer the world, best have dragons."
Hah.

Davos' hearing of all the news really brings home how poor reliable
communication is at this time. It is really hard to remember that
the characters don't know everything we do as the audience. His
decision to go visit the lord is very noble of him.

I was surprised to see Xaro appear again and Jorah mentioned as
well. The whole concept of sex to music as a form of dance is very
GRRM.

Jon's situation is so dire. I like learning the mechanics of how
they keep food at the castle. His advice to Stannis is so good, you
can really see how great a decision it is for him to be in
command. I like that he gets the Wildlings given to him so that he
can save them. Very noble!

Tyrion's interaction with Stone Men was a little bit too timely for
when they are threat to him. I like the way he reveals that he
knows who Griff and Young Griff are, although I don't really like
it because now Dany isn't just not-first-in-line, but actually
she's second behind bother Young Griff and Jon.

Davos' argument with the court is awesome. The audacity of the
claim that Robb turned into a wolf and killed everyone is so
ridiculous. I love that he offers the lord, "The chance to do your
duty." Boom.

Reek's internal musings about how he's been beaten is so
intense. The idea that he's constantly "remembering" his name and
forgetting his real identity is so intense. I like that he
recognizes who Jeyne really is.

It is neat that Free Folk are carving faces in the south, but it
makes me feel like we should have heard about some sort of
shamanistic leadership structure. Jon is so good at understanding
everyone's position around him and it sucks that he can't make
anyone happy. I love his conclusion about what will happen when a
free woman kills a brother that tries to rape her.

The further details about how Aegon survived was cool. Tyrion's
advice to Griff is obviously awesome and he has such a great
understanding of who Dany must really be despite never having met
her. I was very surprised for him to run into Jorah, because so
much of that plot line was merged with Jorah in the show, I assumed
it wasn't going to happen that way at all.

Dany has so much more of a reason to get married in the book and I
like her going through all the options. I'm surprised she hasn't
made it happen with Dario yet. The show doesn't do a good job
making him seem terrible like she sees him in the book. His line
about "better the butcher than the meat" is great.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
