I love
that he bids on himself and his technique for getting Jorah with
him is very clever. The eventual performance for Dany will be neat.

I was very surprised to see a chapter about Jaime. He is doing a
great job not taking up arms against the Tullys, although they
don't know he's made that commitment. The actual details of the
scene were very similar to the thing that happened at Riverrun,
though. I was also surprised to see Briene.

Jon's was very cool. I like the concept of "House Thenn" and their
new heraldry. Alice Karstark is a very cool character. Their
conversation is neat. I'm excited to have Tormund back the next
time he's on screen, although presumably it means that things will
be much worse for the mutiners.

Dany's chapter is quite depressing. I really feel like her when she
talks about how "peace tastes like defeat". It's funny how close
Ben Plum is to tell her about Tyrion.

I'm very surprised that Theon didn't say that Jeyne wasn't Arya,
although I suppose maybe it is just so that he can be got out. The
fight between the Freys and Manderlys was intense! The comment
about "He would have grown up to be a Frey" was great. Jeyne is so
much more messed than Sansa was. They got into such a tough
situation!</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
