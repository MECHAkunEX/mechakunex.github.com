excellent job setting up that this is going to be the biggest thing
in the book for her. I think it is a bit surprising that they woke
wake her for just one soldier dying though. There are so many more
people in her life in the book, although it is surprising that
there is no mention at all of Jorah. I like her use of the phrase
"Wake the Dragon" to refer to herself now.

Jon's warging is much more pronounced. I like that he has a sense
of Nymeria, Summer, and Shaggydog, although he doesn't have enough
doubt about Theon's killing of his brothers. We now know that this
is happening concurrently with A Feast for Crows, because Sam is up
here and has not left yet. I love Lyanna's letter and Jon's
obstinacy towards Stannis as well.

It is interesting that Bran's first experience with the dead is
with Coldhands, who is definitely on his side, although has some
sinister things going on. I like the idea of the raven guards as
well, presumably controlled by the Three-Eyed Raven.

Tyrion's chapter has so many revelations about things in the past:
Viserys trying to get Dany's maidenhead, how Illyrio was seeking to
profit from the Targaryens, the reason why the Golden Company broke
their contract, and Varys' history. I love his observation that
they are journeying through history and time itself on their way to
Dany. Although it is cute that they don't really know where she is.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
