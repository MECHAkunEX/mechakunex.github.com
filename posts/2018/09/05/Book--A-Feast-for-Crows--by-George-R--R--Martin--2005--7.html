meets knows the Hound and presumably he is the gravedigger. It
doesn't seem plausible to me that now that the war is winding down
these people will be at risk. Her review of everything in her life
was interesting.

Cersei is so wrong about everyone. She's so cruel to all her
helpers and completing wasting their support just to weaken them as
potential opponents. It is so apparent. The slowly building dread
with the Mountain is exciting. Her comment about "eating Robert's
heirs" was pretty gross.

At the beginning of Jaime's chapter, I thought about how much I
wanted to hear more about the Starks and Sam... there's not enough
of them in this book. I love how effective Jaime is being and his
attempts to uphold his oaths. Even at the level of his defenses, he
is so changed. This chapter was also a nice contrast to the last,
because he observes the bad consequences of Cersei's rule. The
aunt's comment that Tyrion is Tywin's true son is so apt.

Arya's wolf dreams are so cool, especially given the continual
rumors about Nymeria's pack in the Riverlands. This whole chapter
is fun, especially compared to the beginning of the first book when
Arya is very interested in learning from everyone around her. The
relationship with the Waif is a lot different and she is so boss
when she admits to killing the deserter. It was quite a surprise
for her to be blind at this point, though.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
