apt, as she didn't consider much. I like how quickly Margaery goes
from thinking Cersei might really be helping her to understand that
Cersei is her enemy. Her capture was great and the idea that she
has to confess every hour... ouch. The Mountain's resurrection was
announced and Kevan's invitation to become the Regent. Ouch.

I'm surprised that the Blackfish escaped. The reveal about Jeyne's
mother: woah! I did not see that coming. I love that Nymeria's
attacks are becoming more and more flagrant. I bet Littlefinger
would be very happy to hear from Jaime that he would want him to be
the Hand. Tom of Seven Strings being the bard! Sending no reply to
Cersei! He's changed quite a lot.

It is sad but obvious that no one would believe Sam. The whole
Black Candle thing was very cool. It looks like now we know who
will be going to support Dany. It is interesting to reflect on how
deep the Citadel's opposition to magic, dragons, and prophecies
goes.

The whole theme of this book was definitely just a transition
between two phases of the stories for the big players. Particular
for Dany, as it has provided her with a lot of allies in
Westeros. I can't wait to start the next one. Although I dread it a
little bit, because then I'll be stuck knowing nothing for years
until The Winds of Winter comes out.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
