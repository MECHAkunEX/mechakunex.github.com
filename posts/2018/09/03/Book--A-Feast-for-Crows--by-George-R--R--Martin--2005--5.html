It is a bit sad
for her.

I love Arya's chapters. It was cool the way she kept Needle and the
description of the interaction between her and the Waif. I like the
practical matter of controlling her face and learning Bravosi with
the oyster cart.

Robyn is so lame... his fit about breakfast was perfect. I think
that the books use the phrase "Game of Thrones" far too much. I
wonder what we're supposed to think of his comment that Cersei
underestimates the ability of humble pieces to make their own
moves. It seems like a prophecy about the sparrows. Littlefinger's
plan with the "traitor" is so awesome.

Tommen is way sillier in this. He wants a kitten and to outlaw
beets. Cute. Jaime is getting much bolder with her calling her a
fool. He dreams about Rhaegar were interesting and it is
unsurprising that she suspects Bronn.

I enjoyed the way that Brienne is hearing rumors about the Hound
and "Lady Stoneheart". The septon was a cool character... there
were many things about him integrated into other septons in the
show. I like his monologue about broken men and how he calls his
dog, "Dog".

Sam's chapter was so pathetic! Just leave! Although it was cute for
him to run into Arya.

Jaime is so much more noble so much more quickly. I like his
practice sessions with Payne and how he is cleaning up everyone he
comes across and wants to be remembered as a just man. It was cute
the way he defended Brienne's memory.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
