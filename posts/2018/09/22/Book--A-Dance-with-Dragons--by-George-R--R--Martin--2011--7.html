Her actions with the
disease seem so foolish and she's lost another company of
soldiers. Everything is gathering around to destroy her. "It is
known."

I wonder if we will hear from Jeyne's perspective. Her plea to him
is so pathetic. "Jeyne, it rhymes with pain." is a scary
foreshadowing. I like what we know that he does not: Bran spoke to
him and that the singer is Mance. The lady who is suspicious of
Maesters reminds me of what we know about them from AFFC.

The Dornish chapter was a nice refresher for what is going on over
there. I wonder what will happen when Myrcella meets Swan. The plan
to kill Tristan is interesting, especially compared to the book,
which is totally different. The rumor Doran hears of the Golden
Company will be a surprise to him. I assume he'll support Young
Griff when he shows up, but it will be surprising.

Jon's chapter is very cool. I like him using Val as an emissary to
Tormund and how detailed all his plans are with the Freefolk. It is
really cool how he's learning to talk to Wun Wun and how he has
basically no more animosity towards them. In contrast, the other
leading men of the Night's Watch are very prideful about their
positions before the Watch. Their resentment is a lot deeper, I
think, than in the show. It is clear that Bran was warning him that
they would try to kill him. The Hardhome rescue is coming up, too!

Tyrion riding the pig and interacting with Penny is a bit silly. I
feel like this whole sequence, and indeed a lot of other parts in
the book, is meant to emphasize how difficult travel is in a world
like this. The show doesn't do that at all.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
