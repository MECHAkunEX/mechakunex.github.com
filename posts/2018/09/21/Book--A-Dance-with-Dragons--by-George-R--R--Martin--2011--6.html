I felt
like as soon as we learned that Manderly was treating Davos well,
it meant that he would join Stannis' side. I love the whole "The
North Remembers" thing and I think that it is cool that Wex has
come back. I don't get the reference for where Rickon is, but I
think it is a cool plot to go get him.

Dany's situation is so dire and I feel like there's basically no
escape for her. Hizdar is totally untrustworthy too.

I really enjoyed hearing Melissandre's perspective. Her vision was
awesome... she's seeing Dany. Her comment that she prays for a
vision of Azor Ahai but only sees Snow is great. The daggers in the
night is sad and prophetic. I think that the boy with the wolf's
face must be Bran and the wooden man is the three-eyed raven. It's
cool that she doesn't need food and that she has turned Mance into
Rattle Shirt. A lot more magic than previously. I wonder what will
happen trying to get Jeyne...

Lord Bolton's comment to Reek about saying "m'lord" was a nice port
to Tywin during his time with Arya. It's sad that he knows Ramsay
will kill his sons. That kind of thoughtfulness doesn't fit with
his show character.

Tyrion's "blah blah" during the red prayer was awesome. It's kind
of odd for him to have this little history lesson about other
little people. Valyria is so neat to hear about too.

Oh man, Bran's chapter was so awesome. I love him being a raven and
learning about how ravens really did used to speak. The whole room
full of other enthroned children was cool. His thought about how
men would be "mad" not "sad" at having their time go away is very
apt. The tree visions of the Winterfell Godswood was cool.

It is neat that Jon has got some wildlings to actually join the
Watch and that there's now a Giant on the team. His observation
about the "realms of men" and seeing all the different tribes of
Freefolk and Westerosi gathered together as "men" was very cool.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
