deeper than the corresponding show scenes. I liked that he wants to
send Dany a Maester. It did not occur to me that Melissandre would
want to burn him. The idea of "answering death with life" and their
first make-out was cute, although a little less sweet because of
the rum.

Cersei's sending off of Loras is interesting. I think that the
brother that will kill her will end up being Jaime. The younger
queen is definitely Dany. Her vow to kill everyone to protect
Tommen is very apt. Her plan to kill Margaery is much deeper and
more intricate as well.

Brienne seeing Gendry was cool, especially how he just barely found
out about his father. She definitely gets in the most fights of
anyone and they are very cool.

Jaime's comparison of the Blackfish and Ned is very apt. I wonder
if they would be friends... probably. I like that Jaime wants to
tell him how honest he is but the Blackfish doesn't care. His
putting down of the Frey was awesome and his speech to Edmure was
cool too. I love that he had the singer play Castamere.

Cersei's torturing and teasing of Pycell was so her. The plan to
get Margaery is waaay more complicated and vicious, at least in the
show she really did do something wrong. Although if Pycell is
honest about the moon tea, then something is up.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
