It is fun
how diverse they all are. The foreboding of the coming Others is
neat, especially how everyone is nervous about getting across in
time. Hardhome is not going well at all.

I think the random drama of Barristan and the many who are
competing over Mereen is necessary but not too exciting. I liked
hearing about where Barristan's title came from. I don't know how
Hizdar will meet his end.

Quentin's plan to tame the dragons and hire the free company is
very clever. I hope he succeeds. I want him to get Tyrion too.

Griff's successfully taking back his castle and organizing the
Golden Company is a lot of fun. All of his plans for alliance and
marriage seem unlikely to be successful though. I liked hearing
about the story of the Battle of the Bells and how he thought Tywin
would have done it.

Asha's story is basically just about how terrible Stannis' camp is
working out, although I would expect it to be worse. I like the
comment about "Better craven than cannibal." The arrival of the guy
from the Iron Bank and Theon is very surprising. I hope that Theon
will tell Stannis about Jeyne.

Victarian is surprisingly competent and successful in his work. I
like that he is freeing all the slaves he comes in contact with and
that he is offended by people saying that Dany has died.

Naturally, it is really cool how Arya does her first kill. The Hall
of Faces and how she has dreams of the Ugly Girl is really neat. It
is clever how she poisoned the coin and I like the epicness of her
getting her robe of black &amp; white.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
