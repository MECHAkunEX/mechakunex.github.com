Freefolk referred to her as the Bearded Queen. Nice. Tormund was so
awesome, too: King of My Hairy Butt Crack! The letter from Ramsay
was intense and very similar, but different than the show. I was
really surprised at how quickly Jon was killed after making his
announcement and at home many people were there to see. Tormun and
Wun-Wun can immediately go to bad for him. I assume that someone
was trying to kill the giant because they knew he'd help Jon.

Barristan's chapter was a great conclusion, as well. The cap to
Quentin's story was very final, but I think that the Dornish still
have something to do. I like that Barristan saw through Quentin's
purpose and educated the other Dornish. The launching of the
corpses is really ominous.

Dany's crazy dreams and learning to fly with Drogon was really
cool. I like that the dragon's blood is literally fire and it burns
up the shafts that are lodged in him. Her moon blood is very
interesting, as is her desire to see Jorah. I think it is neat that
she thinks so many people will go looking for her, but they are
trapped in their own rough circumstances.

The epilogue is really intense because there are so many different
things that are on the precipice: it is snowing in the city; they
are planning what to do about Cunningtom; and so on. I was really
surprised for Varys to show up and kill Kevan, just because he was
doing a good job. That's a pretty Baelish thing to do, although
Varys apparently really wants the city to cry out for a noble
leader, like he thinks Young Griff will be. I think his reasons are
quite good. I finally realized that the three-headed Targaryen
dragon is Dany, Jon, and Young Griff.
