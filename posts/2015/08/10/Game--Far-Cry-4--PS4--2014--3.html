The first thing I
did was focus on getting the harder animal skins. At the end of
yesterday's session, I bought the Elephant Rider skill, so I
decided to try that out to get around and hunt rhinos near the
river in the south. It worked out very well, because other animals
don't attack the elephant (just soldiers do.) This basically means
you just have to chase them down. I was able to gather everything
I needed. The only animals I have left to skin are Snow Leopards,
which don't appear to be on the Southern map at all.

After that, I spent the rest of the time going from one outpost to
another taking it over. Normally what I've been doing is sending
an RPG at the alarm, then slowly stealth killing with the bow from
a distance. However, on a few of them, I've been harassed by
Dholes as hide in the forest. Somehow on two occasions I was able
to get the Dholes to go into the outpost and attack. This led to
two different takeovers being culminated by the animals, which I
found a little funny.

I only have a few more outposts in the South before I move on to
my next goal. My options are: try to take over a fortress, gather
all the collectibles, or do real campaign missions. I think it
would be cool to do the fortress, but the map screen says that you
need to weaken them by campaign missions. I'm going to read about
that online and see what exactly it entails, because it would be
very fun to do it without that advantage.
