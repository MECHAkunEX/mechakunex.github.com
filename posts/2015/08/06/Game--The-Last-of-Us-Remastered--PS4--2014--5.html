As someone who knows Salt Lake City really well, it was kind of
disappointing that it didn't look very accurate. I'm glad they
included the temple, because it is iconic, but it was in the
totally wrong place and didn't even look very accurate. There
wasn't even a Moroni on top!

The ending of the main game was pretty intense. I felt like the
combat had a nice conclusion and the emotional impact of Joel's
choice was pretty intense. It was kind of crazy how the doctors
were totally defenseless at the end.

I really liked the Left Behind DLC. The story reveals in the
flashback were pretty touching. I was getting lesbian vibes for
most of it and wasn't too surprised when they kissed. It feels
really cheap and fan-fic-y to do that though. I really liked the
part where she plays the game. It was very cute and fun.

The non-flashback part was really intense. It took a lot of what I
liked about the main game and crammed it into a tight
experience. I was able to do lots of stealth and there was lots of
impact in the story telling. I think my favourite little detail
was when Ellie ignored the comic in the pharmacy because she's
just thinking about Joel.
