I explored the second half of the Nightmare of Mensis and did
everything there. I had a lot of trouble with the Brain Trust
enemies and the Maneater Pigs. Eventually I got around the Pigs by
sneaking through the waterway to their left. I found the boss of
the area to be very fun and a little challenging. I whacked it
with Bolt Paper and was pretty careful. The hardest part was when
it made the purple fog and summoned a clone. I had a hard time
switching out of my great-sword mode so I could do a quick swipe
on the clone.

After that I got the Umbilical Cord from Arianna and fought
Gehrman. I found him to be very challenging. I had to grind a
little every few attempts to have enough Blood Vials. But the last
time I fought him, I only had 17 and didn't use very many. The key
was learning when to try for a Visceral Strike and when to be
aggressive. I also used Bolt Paper on him right before he
transformed so I could get a ton of damage on him during his
transformation. That worked out really well.

I beat the Moon Presence on the second try after adjusting my
runes and being a little bit more careful. I also used Bolt Paper.

I really enjoyed this game. I felt like the combat was much more
tense and the environment much more creepy than the Souls games. I
found myself using items a lot more than in a Souls game. For
instance, by the end of a Souls game I have basically never used
any of the weapon buffs, but in this I used them a lot. I think it
was because I had no other use for Insight and it was a resource
that couldn't really be taken away, so I bought lots of supplies
like that.

My final stats were as follows:
Level: 94
Vitality: 30
Endurance: 40
Strength: 36
Skill: 25
Bloodtinge: 7
Arcane: 6

I used Ludwig's Holy Blade and upgraded it to +10 and had on the
two +18% and then a +12% (I think) gems, so its final attack power
was 580.
