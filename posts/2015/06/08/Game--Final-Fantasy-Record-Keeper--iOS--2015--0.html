weeks. It's the first free-to-play game like this that I've tried
other than an incredibly brief stint playing Puzzle &amp; Dragons.

I find the game very addictive, although I haven't spent any
money, which I'm glad about. The boss battles are fun and it's
nice to plan a combination that destroys them, just like in the
normal games. The grind through enemies is really easy and not
very interesting, but because of the mechanics of the game, it is
really annoying.

Pros: The boss battles, the nostalgia, the graphics, and that I
don't feel like I need to pay money.

Cons: The user interface is terrible and it is very difficult to
manage my inventory and characters. The inventory limits are very
annoying and make me got manage things before every battle. I hate
that I feel like I've missed cool characters and things because I
didn't start at the beginning of the game's release. 

The thing that I hate the most, however, is that the Stamina
system and Daily Events make me feel like I have to play all the
time. If I just bought the game and could play whenever I wanted,
then I'd play it whenever I felt like it, when I was bored or
waiting for something. But, because I can only do 50-ish points of
actions, I feel like I need to use them all up and then once they
are filled up again, I have to check again. This is really
annoying and makes me feel like I should play even more than I
would want to otherwise. This is worsened by the Events, which
will expire and I won't get the reward if I don't do them by the
date. 

This is really annoying and dumb and I'm going to save myself the
grief and just delete the game.
