Afghanistan. My main goal was to work on getting Quiet's bond
level up, so I just kept having her shoot guys. I learned how to
use the iDroid to tell her where to go and what mode to be in,
which has made things a lot better. I eventually unlocked the
tranquilizer gun, which is very fun. The AI is reacting really
poorly to her, because they often cannot get to her but they try
to, so the guards are just wiggling against the edge of cliff
hopelessly. It makes it really easy to sneak up on them and grab
them.

I went to the Base Camp and had a great time gathering all the
containers there. On the way, I took out some heavy infantry,
which was funny to fight with Quiet using the Tranq gun, because
it just bounces off their helmets. She managed to shoot one as it
was coming down from a lookout post, so he fell down and got
stunned.

I'm butting up against not having enough fuel to do more base
building. Actually, I have the fuel, but it is not being processed
fast enough so I can't actually use it, which is definitely very
annoying.

I have to admit that it is a bit embarrassing playing the game
when Quiet is on the screen because she is so unnecessarily
sexualized. Luckily that's only during the helicopter sequences.
