Last week some time, I decided to play Minecraft Survival with my
son because he loves it so much and I thought it would be nice to
do something he likes. The best part was that it gave him the
confidence to play on Survival himself and now he's having a lot
more fun playing than he used to on Creative.

We had a funny experience on our first night: we hid in the ocean
running around away from mobs. After building a basic house on a
hill on the coast, we began digging a mine. At first, I made it
like a big staircase going gradually down in one direction, but
then I realized it would be more efficient to make a spiral
staircase. Once we did that, we built another house inside the
mine. I spent a long time in that mine looking for
diamond. Eventually we found a cave structure and a lot of lava,
then finally after many days of effort found 4 diamonds. This was
enough to get a pickaxe and get some obsidian. It was tough
getting the obsidian because it kept burning up in the lava. We
got some water and dug out the obsidian to make sure no lava was
around before mining it. After we had it, we went back to the
surface to get ready for going to the Nether.

On the surface again, I made an automated wheat farm and made a
giant wall around my original house, mine entrance, and farm. I
transformed the area to make it so I had good sight-lines
everywhere and torches everywhere to prevent mobs from coming
in. I find that the wheat factory does not work very well and I
need a lot more seeds.
