(surprisingly little for how long I played, although I played each
mission multiple times to even out my levels.)

This game definitely looks like a PSP game and not at all like a
PS4 game. The models are all pretty bad, the animation is bad, and
I'm amazed that the loading times are so bad.

The battles are really fun, although it is a little bit loose and
unsophisticated and the camera is way too sensitive and basically
useless.

The game feels like it wants you to grind a lot, but on the other
hand it feels very hard to actually grind because it costs so many
hours to fight in the field, but the missions are a bit too long
and painful to grind during. I wish there were more difficulty
options between Officer and Agito so I could gradually ramp
up. Even though I played the same missions many times, it was
always fun because of the combat.

The timer and all the different events makes me feel like I am
missing everything every day of the game time, which is very
annoying.

The story is very fun and bizarre. I like the way that l'Cie in
this game are background superheroes, unlike the other FF13 games
where you are the l'Cie.

I think the most surprising thing about this game is that it isn't
really like an RPG at all. The combat is totally action-based, you
don't seem to gain that much from leveling up, and there's never
any weapons or armor to buy. It feels more like a Final Fantasy
team wanted to make a Monster Hunter-like game and followed the
pattern that they knew and ended up with this.

I will definitely keep playing, but I am very annoyed at not being
able to keep my team balanced or spend the huge amounts of gil
that I have available. We'll see how I feel after another session.
