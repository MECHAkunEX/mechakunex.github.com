I thought this movie was so awesome. I was almost giddy as the
title scroll opened and I was watching a new Star Wars movie. The
movie felt so nostalgic and similar to the first trilogy in the
wonder and openness of the story, as opposed to the prequels which
felt very stuck in one place and like they were just by-rote
arriving at a known conclusion.

The new characters are very interesting and fun. Finn is very cute
as an idea and Rey is awesome. I really liked it when Finn was
like, "We'll use the force" and Han is like, "That's not how it
works." Good moment. Kylo Ren was a great villain and his Force
powers are really cool. I really like the mystery and implications
of the interleaving years, with Luke having tried to start a new
Jedi order and failed, first on his own nephew. I think the First
Order were very sinister villains and I wonder if they can possibly
recover from this hit or if the next movie's villainy will be
focused just on the "Supreme Leader" character.

Questions...
- Who was the old guy in the beginning that knew Kylo?
- Why is his name Kylo Ren and not "Darth" Ren or something like
that, is he not a Sith?
- Finn says he was taken as a child... how does that work? It's
very funny how he was not even an important Stormtrooper.
- How and why did Kylo turn to the Dark Side? I thought it was so
cool and iconic that he was idolizing Vader.
- Who are Rey's parents? She clearly seems like a
Skywalker---strong Force, great pilot, great with machines---but
she can't be Leia's child or all the characters involved, Leia,
Han, and Kylo would have said something. Is she Luke's? But then
who is the mother and why would he leave her? To protect her from
him or others? Seems like a very bad life to leave her in. I
suppose if he left her with Leia she'd be a target for Kylo as
clearly a Skywalker. I really want to watch her vision again.
- Who is this Supreme Leader guy, Snokes?
- What will Luke say to Rey? He looked great and I'm amazed that he
had no lines at all.

I like it and think that it is necessary for Han to have died to
pave the way for new heroes and close the book on his group's
adventures. It also makes a nice echo for the similarities between
this movie and the first, as the mentor ("Father I've never had")
is killed at the end in a light-saber duel. They even included a
cantina and a similar moment about the Kessel Run (that was a great
nod!)

I feel like Finn could become a Jedi, except that it goes against
the similarities to the previous trilogy and distracts from the
emphasis on the Skywalker family. I find it very believable that
people would not remember the Jedi, because even when Luke was
young it had been 20 years since they were around and it's not like
Luke was really that famous either, so we're 50 years (a generation
and a half) from the Republic and the height of lots of Jedi.

As a final note, I watched it in 3D and thought it was very
good. It was the first movie I ever saw in 3D, so I was nervous
about it being gimmicky or hard to follow, but I enjoyed it and had
no objection.

It is very fascinating to be able to wonder and ask these
questions.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2015/">2015</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
