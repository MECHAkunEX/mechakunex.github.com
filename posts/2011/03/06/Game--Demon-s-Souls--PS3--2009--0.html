I had heard
a lot of praise of this game, in particular its satisfying
difficulty from podcasts, so I wanted to try it out. It was on
sale around Christmas, so I bought it.

I played it for about three weeks, I think. In all, I spent a
little less than 28 hours in the game.

This game is basically an action-RPG with faux-roguelike-style
death system, where you keep your items, but lose your experience,
at least unless you've "spent" the experience on upgrades. The
combat is real-time action and based heavily around anticipating
the moves of enemies, blocking and dodging appropriately. I
basically did not use the magic or miracle systems. Partly because
of my class and stats, but mainly because it wasn't necessary.

A lot of people online clamour about how difficult the game is,
how "unforgiving", or how there is no "hand-holding". I honestly
do not know what they mean. I consider it very forgiving to allow
you to keep all your stuff when you die (unless Shiren or
Nethack.) I'm not sure what hand-holding I would've wanted---there
are some complicated statistics, but I beat the game just fine
with a very cursory understanding of them. As far as the general
difficulty goes, the action definitely requires skill, but as long
as you are willing to learn, you will; and as long as you are
cautious, you'll never be caught off guard. So many "action RPGs"
are like Zelda, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts, etc where you can
effectively run up to large hordes of enemies, slam one button,
and have success. Demon's Souls just requires caution and care.

So, Demon's Souls is definitely difficult, but compared to, for
example, Mushihime-sama Futari, it's a cake walk. One thing that
is very good about it though is that the deaths are rarely cheap:
you almost all know what you did wrong and how to improve. This
was one of the most enjoyable things about the game for me, I
really felt like I was learning and improving in the beginning
portion of the game.

As I played, I thought a lot about Nethack and roguelikes and the
concept of "spoilers". In those games, you can't "spoil" the game
in the sense of revealing secrets of the story or game-breaking
exploits; instead, you can just give general strategies that have
to be learned and internalized before being useful. Demon's Souls
is very much in the Nethack camp, although because it is not
randomized there are things that /could/ be spoiled (like
where treasures are) but it's not really significant. I liked that
about it.

My play order had a large effect on my enjoyment of the game. I
started in World 1, as you must, and got to the end of 1-2, but a
large fog gate prevented my passing until I had completed another
world. I played 2-1, but the Armor Spider got the best of me. I
went to 3-1 to get light armor and got a large shield from enemies
in 1-2. Once I dropped my heavy armor and had a huge shield, the
game got a lot easier: being quick is very important in this game
and dodging totally negates the need for large damage
reduction. (I also invested in a lot of Vitality so I'd have
health to offset it and Endurance so I could attack a lot and
defend a lot.) I got through all of World 2 after that, then got
to the end of 1-5, but the boss beat me. (I later learned that the
1-5 boss is effectively the last boss in terms of the story and
difficulty.) Because he got the best of me, I went through
World 3. The 3-2 boss was a pain, so I did a little grinding to
get enough Dexterity to use a good bow. After that, the whole game
was a cake-walk. I beat the 3-2 boss on my first try after that
and went directly to the 3-3 boss and beat it. Over the next two
days, I finished Worlds 4 and 5. The same day I went from 4-2 to
5-3 I also beat the final boss and won.

After I got through 3-2, the game became incredibly easy and
rote---I didn't really need to learn anything new to be
successful. I attribute this to a few things: simply learning the
game and getting comfortable; having a glut of healing items
(almost 99 of each kind, just from drops); having a ton of
experience by going depth-first rather than breadth-first (and a
little grinding.) If I played it again, I think I'd have more of
an enjoyable challenge by playing the game in a different
order.

I did have a few frustrating experiences:
- The first time I got to the 1-5 boss, I had 90,000 unspent
souls. I didn't realize he'd be so hard, so I tried to fight him
and lost. Ouch. At that time, 10,000 would have given me a new
level.
- When I was in 3-2, I kept getting tossed off the tower by the
3-2 boss. I probably did it 15 times before I learned to avoid
his pounce attack.
- Getting past the blue dragon in 1-5 was frustrating too, because
if you get hit, it is easy to get knocked down and be unable to
roll away before getting hit and knocked down again. It felt
really cheap.
- Sometimes locking on to enemies can be a really stupid idea,
mainly when there are flying enemies around, because once you
dispatch the locked on enemy (or it moves out of range), it
immediately goes to the next target, which may be a flying enemy
and your camera goes spinning around crazy.
- The first time I did the 3-3 boss I was online and fought
another player. He and I both had lots of healing items so we
spun around each other chipping damage and then healing it for
over an hour. I was so annoyed that someone was interrupting my
enjoyable game. If it were me, I would've just given up after 30
minutes. I was playing at home alone at the time and when my wife
got home I had her unplug the PS3 to knock me off line. I
immediately went back to the boss and beat the AI version in
under 5 minutes. Ridiculous.

The only "bug" I experienced was getting corpses from the enemy
caught on my character and pulling them around the map. It looks
really dumb. Overall the game gets high technical marks.

Final stats:
Gender: Male
Class: Temple Knight

Vitality: 30
Intelligence: 10
Endurance: 40
Strength: 25
Dexterity: 24
Magic: 10
Faith: 25
Luck: 7

Soul Level: 91

Throughout the game I used this equipment:

Steel Shield +1
Black leather armor
Blessed Mace+1
White Bow    

This is another testament to the easiness of the game, I basically
totally ignored the weapon upgrade system (in addition to the
magic systems.)

Overall, the game was very good. I don't think I'm interested in
playing a New Game+ because the difficulty increase is just based
on stats, so it's just an arms race, rather than having
different/more difficult patterns, etc.    </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Demon's Souls/">Demon's Souls</a></li><li><a href="/cat/PS3/">PS3</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2009/">2009</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
