In the book, women who have the ability to have babies are rotated around important men and are forced to carry their children. The book is a narrative by one such woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night when I go to bed I think, In the morning I will wake up in my own house and things will be back the way they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hasn't happened this morning, either. [p. 199]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part I found interesting was when Offred---the narrator's name---longs for her old husband from before the dystopia started and thinks about how great it was to have the problems they had: who to take out the trash, who to cook, etc.. She says, "How were we to know we were happy?" (p. 51) I always find it valuable to think back to earlier times when life was harder and smile at my luck for being born when I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offred's friend makes the remark: "You can't help what you feel, but you can help how you behave." (p. 192) Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read books like this, or watch movies about wars and the like, I always wonder what I would do in the situation. After first, I think I would try to escape, provided I could bring my family safely. Otherwise, I'd like to think that I would be brave and join, or start, a militia and defend the country. But, I have the sneaking suspicion that I would use the safety of my family as an excuse and try to work subversively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing about books like this is that the author obviously had some intent when she wrote it. I wonder what Atwood's was. Does she think this world represents something anyone in the United States wants? Or that the actions of these people say anything about modern America? It does not seem that way to me, and on that note I don't see this book as much of a success if its provocation was meant to change feelings. However, I plan on looking online for some interpretation of it. &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid&amp;apos;s_Tale'&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; is a start.&lt;/p&gt;
