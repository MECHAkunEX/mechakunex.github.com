Story: The story was pretty cute and without some of the more
ridiculous things that happen in movies like this. The first five
minutes are particularly cheeseball though, so don't be turned off
right away.

*REDACTED*acters: The two characters are very lovable. And their
relationship is ultra-cute. Basically, they fight all the time
about little things... Kareena always mistakes what Fardeen means
and this is humourous. Kareena is also very difficult and gives
Fardeen pain in an amusing way. (I was very proud of myself when I
got what a surprised/confused/hurt face was about--Kareena made
Fardeen call her by the formal second person pronoun, /aap/,
rather than the informal, /tum/, that they used before a
fight. But I don't think I should be proud, a billion Indians would
have gotten it when they were six.)

Costumes: Kareena's outfits throughout the movie are great; not
/Devdas/ great, but good in a different way.

Songs: The first few songs were kind of bad and there's
basically a Pepsi ad in the middle of the movie; but, the later
songs are really good -- particularly the one when they dress up as
different people and after the hospital scene.

Overall: I thought it was good overall and can imagine renting it
again to show to someone.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2003/">2003</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
