Now I am hooked. Look below for some random thoughts on the world of Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year I: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590353403/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year II: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439064864/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year III: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807282324/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year IV: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807282596/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I was completely hooked on Harry and thought that the series was fabulous. I'm not sure if this was due to the quality of the action and events of this Year, or because this was the first book that I had not seen acted out as a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoyed the discussions of magic in this Year as Harry trained for the trials. And, I thought the final sequence was awesome, as it made Voldemort into a real character who _was_ scary, rather than just someone whom the characters discussed as thought he were fearsome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year V: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807220299/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fourth book, I wonder whether I would be let done with the next. But, Mrs. Rowling did _not_ let me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content about the Wizarding world and the mythology of Harry in this book was fabulous. Its only real problem, in my opinion, was an unnaturally long drought of action while Harry had dreams and tried to counter what Umbridge was doing. However, the pay-off was fabulous and the final sequence was amazing. At this point you really believe that Dumbledore is as powerful as he is described, much the two fight scenes with Yoda in the last two &lt;cite&gt;Star Wars&lt;/cite&gt; movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite part of this book, though, was the bit about Dumbledore's Army and Harry acting as a quality teacher. I thought that it was under emphasized, and I would have like to read about how Harry described things and how the students reacted. I wonder if this study group will continue in Book VI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year VI: &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439784549/-20/'&gt;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was awesome as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading it was very exciting and I had to read it in one sitting to be satisfied... I literally could not put it down. However, after the end, I thought there was not much action until the very end. Since I wasn't bothered during the reading, I have resolved to not be bother after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people I talked to thought the dating was bit much, but I didn't think it was over the top. Although, I did think the bit with Ginny at the end was a cheap way of Rowling getting out of one more thing to close in the next book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was let down about was the complete shutout of any experience of Snape as a teacher of Defense Against Dark Arts after the initial class. Regarding Snape, strangely, I actually trust him more after this episode... not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how Rowling will close out the series in the next book. I wait in anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Students and more on emphasis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I enjoyed about the early books, and that I continue to enjoy if it is mentioned in later books, is the talk of what goes on in the students' classes. These conversations generally do a great job of explaining interesting details about the Wizarding world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the later books, not only is this not emphasized... as more and more happens outside of school; but also, the students no longer seem to attend or pay attention to their classes. Harry and Ron essentially never pay attention and Hermione is being a bookworm over things related to the adventure, not her classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is Arithmancy anyways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry's Vengeance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in Year IV, Harry's anger and vengeance seem to be getting the most of him. I have a distinct fear that he is losing an essential part of nobility and honor: pity for his enemies. Certainly he is not becoming evil in general, as he continues to do good and look out for others. But, he is incredibly willing to hurt or torment Dudley, Malfoy, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it surprising that he doesn't seem to have much of a change of heart after he discovers the details of the relationship between his father and Snape. And, of course, his father's vices will be worse in Harry, because Harry is so much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This aspect of Harry is causing me to start disliking him, although there are still things I really like, i.e. teaching the D.A. in Book V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
