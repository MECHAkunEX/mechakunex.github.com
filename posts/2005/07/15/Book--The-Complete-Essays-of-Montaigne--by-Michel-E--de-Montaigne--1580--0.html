&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a group of people were to play a game where they tried to quote Roman writers in context and muse about Roman history, with subtle links to the present. Suppose that the winner was obsessively impressed with Sparta, Alexander, Caesar, and Cicero. This winner might as well change his name to Montaigne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very little of Montaigne feels like it is unique, the artful way he combines many stories and quotes (sometimes of many pages and unattributed!) is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuggets of himself that he puts in are, again, interesting, but I don't see myself in them like Emerson did, probably due to my preference for Athens over Sparta, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I/4: How the soul discharges its passions on false objects when the true are wanting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plutarch says of those who grow fond of monkeys and little dogs that the loving part that is in us, lacking a legitimate object, rather than remain idle, thus forges itself a false and frivolous one. And we see that the soul in its passions will sooner deceive itself by setting up a false and fantastical object, even contrary to its own belief, than not act against something. [p. 14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other application of this idea is, of course, when people are attracted to the idea of a loving relationship, but do not actually love the person they are with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I/20: That to philosophize is to learn to die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caesar, observing the decrepit appearance of a soldier of his guard, an exhausted and broken man, who came to him in the street to ask leave to kill himself, replied humorously: "So you think you're alive." [p. 63]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a person on the verge of suicide is not very much alive for different reasons than Caesar and Montaigne. In my opinion, such a person has such low regard for themselves that life is worthless in their eyes, and thus not truly experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I/39: Of solitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason and sense remove anxiety,&lt;br/&gt;
Not villas that look out upon the sea,&lt;br/&gt;
- Horace [p. 175]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I/40: A consideration upon Cicero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companions of Demosthenes in the embassy of Philip praised that prince as being handsome, eloquent, and a good drinker. Demosthenes said that those were praises more appropriate to a woman, a lawyer, and a sponge, than to a king. [p. 184]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;II/2: Of drunkenness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man advanced in dignity and age counted drink among the three principal comforts that he used to say he had left in life. But he took it in the wrong way. Fastidiousness is to be avoided in it, and careful selection of wines. If you make your pleasure depend on drinking good wine, you condemn yourself to the pain of sometimes drinking bad wine. We must have a less exacting and freer taste. To be a good drinker, one must not have so delicate a palate. The Germans drink almost all wines with equal pleasure. Their aim is to swallow rather than to taste. They have much the better of the bargain. Their pleasure is much more plentiful and ready at hand. [p. 247]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first real time I saw something in Montaigne that I see in myself. I have made a comment almost exactly like this to my friends and family with regards to preferences for high varieties of anything. I commonly say that connoisseurs actually appreciate and enjoy less than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;II/12: Apology for Raymond Sebond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are prone to apply the meaning of other men's writing to suit opinions that they have previously determined in their minds; and an atheist flatters himself by reducing all authors to atheism, infecting innocent matter with his own venom. [p. 327]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vice of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not a pastime to her more than she is to me? [p. 331]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised at the age of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is certainly crazy. He could not make a mite, and he makes gods by the dozen. [p. 395]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clever way to put this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;II/17: Of presumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Remember] this saying of the late Chancellor Olivier, that the French are like monkeys who climb to the top of a tree, from branch to branch, and never stop moving until they have reached the highest branch, and show their rear ends when they get there. [p. 490]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight from a French mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;II/32: Defense of Seneca and Plutarch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montaigne is talking about this author, Bodin, who does not believe the amazing things that Plutarch has written about the Spartans as part of his effort to deify the Lacedaemons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing, according to their custom, in which their reputation was more concerned, or for which they had more blame and shame to suffer, than being caught stealing. I am so steeped in the greatness of those people that not only does Plutarch's story not seem incredible to me, as it does to Bodin, but I do not find it even rare and strange. Spartan history is full of a thousand more cruel and uncommon examples: by this standard it is all miracle. [p. 547]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the comments that makes me really dislike Montaigne for having idiotic blind faith in the ancients, wound up with a dogmatic insistence of the superiority of the Spartans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I sound exaggerated, read what Plutarch actually wrote about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;II/37: Of the resemblance of children to fathers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I'd rather be a good cook, if I didn't have one to serve me. [p. 596]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how, but someone turned up the obnoxious on Montaigne when he wrote the third book. It was painful to get through. Maybe it was trying to do all 850 pages at once and the first 600 rubbed the wrong way, so I might try to read it again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1580/">1580</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
