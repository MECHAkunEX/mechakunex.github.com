Throughout the book they have some very clever dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On musicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We'l win, of course," he said.&lt;br/&gt;
"You don't want that," said the demon.&lt;br/&gt;
"Why not, pray?"&lt;br/&gt;
"Listen," said Crowly desperately, "how many musicians do you think your side have got, eh? First grade, I mean."&lt;br/&gt;
Aziraphale looked taken aback.&lt;br/&gt;
"Well, I should think--" he began.&lt;br/&gt;
"Two," said Crowley. "Elgar and Liszt.  That's all. We've got the rest. Beethoven, Brahms, all the Bachs, Mozart, the lot. Can you imagine eternity with Elgar?"&lt;br/&gt;
Aziraphale shut his eyes. "All too easily," he groaned. [p. 32]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some decent religious thinking in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were people who called themselves Satanist who made Crowley squirm. It wasn't just the things they did, it was the way they blamed it all on Hell. They'd come up with some stomach-churning idea that no demon could have thought of in a thousand years, some dark and mindless unpleasantness that only a fully-functioning human brain could conceive, then shout "The Devil Made Me Do It" and get the sympathy of the cout when the whole point was that the Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything. He didn't have to. That was what some humans found hard to understand. Hell wasn't a major reservoir of evil, any more than Heaven, in Crowley's opinion, was a fountain of goodness; they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game. Where you found the real McCot, the real grace and the real heart-stopping evil, was right inside the human mind. [p. 69]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some colorful language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man may have had all his own teeth, but only because no one else could possibly have wanted them; just one of them, placed under the pillow, would have made the Tooth Fairy hand in its wand. [p. 156]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Every] couple of months Crowley would pick out a plan that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around all the other plants. "Say goodbye to your friend," he'd say to them. "He just couldn't cut it..." [p. 218-219]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1990/">1990</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
