&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1: The Law of Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis discusses the common law of decency and morality that all humans seem to recognize. While referencing that violations of this law are always followed by excuses he writes these remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly always he tries to make out that what he has been doing does not really go against the standard, or that if it does there is some special excuse. [p. 3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that they are one more proof of how deeply, whether we like it or not, we believe in the Law of Nature. If we do not believe in decent behaviour, why should we be so anxious to make excuses  for not having behaved decently? The truth is, we believe in decency so much--we feel the Rule or Law pressing on us so--that we cannot bear to face the fact that we are breaking it, and consequently we try to shift the responsibility. [p. 6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2: Some Objections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not believe they are there. You would not call a man human for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house. [p. 12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regard this as a defense against hyperbole in discussions about Christianity. If someone has a critic of Christian morals, their argument should be based on the morals in question, not the colorful and horrible past of that moral belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 4: What Lies Behind the Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe--no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or stair case or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. [p. 19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book II: What Christians Believe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2: The Invasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the problem? A universe that contains much that is obviously bad and apparently meaningless, but containing creatures like ourselves who know that it is bad and meaningless. There are only two views that face all the facts. One is the Christian view that this a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought have been. [p. 33]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say that the other is Dualism and that it fails because it implies that the evil God is less superior because of its evilness, and thus either created by the good God, or that both were created by a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be good for the mere sake of goodness: you cannot be bad for the mere sake of badness. [...] Goodness is, so to speak, itself: badness is only spoiled goodness. [p. 35]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common remark in &lt;cite&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5: The Practical Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every historical statement in the world is believed on authority. None of us has seen the Norman Conquest or the defeat of the Armada. None of us could prove them by pure logic as you prove a thing in mathematics. We believe them simply because people who did see them have left writings that tell us about them: in fact, on authority. A man who jibbed at authority in other things as some people do in religion would have to be content to know nothing all his life. [p. 48]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book III: Christian Behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 7: Forgiveness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction: how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life--namely myself. However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit or greed, I went on loving myself. [p. 90]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book IV: Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1: Making and Begetting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter is like God in having energy: though, again, of course, physical energy is a different kind of thing from the power of God. The vegetable world is like Him because it is alive, and He is the "living God." [...] The intense activity and fertility of the insects, for example, is a first dim resemblance to the unceasing activity and the creativeness of God. In the higher mammals we get the beginnings of instinctive affection. [...] When we come to man, the highest of the animals, we get the completest resemblance to God which we know of. [...] Man not only lives, but loves and reasons: biological life reaches its highest known level in him. [p. 123]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 9: Counting the Cost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a good many people have been bothered by what I said in the last chapter about Our Lord's words, "Be ye perfect." Some people seem to think this means "Unless you are perfect, I will not help you"; and as we cannot be perfect, then, if He meant that, our position is hopeless. But I do not think He did mean that. I think He meant "The only help I will give is help to become perfect. You may want something less: but I will give you nothing less." [p. 157]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
