I really cannot tell if Petyr is being honest with Sansa, as he
lies so much. I think he is, and I hope he'll help her army no
matter what.

Daenerys' scene was powerful but shorter than I wanted.

It is weird that the Faceless Men have such an attitude of
servitude when they were once slaves. I feel like there is no way
Arya will ever really be one of them, although she may learn
their tricks.

The Priestesses of the Lord of Light are so interesting as
characters. I feel like so much is coming together right now for
Dany (and many other characters)... is it downhill and easy from
here? Seems unlikely.

The scenes between Euron and Yara were cool. I feel like Euron is
actually going to be better for the islands and the world,
although there is no way that Dany would ever have him. I wonder
what adventures Yara will go on.

The scenes with Bran were really amazing. What a way to go. Meera
and Bran are so on there own now and with seemingly no
direction. I bet he's deeply regretting going in the dream. It's
also crazy that he caused Hodor's problem.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
