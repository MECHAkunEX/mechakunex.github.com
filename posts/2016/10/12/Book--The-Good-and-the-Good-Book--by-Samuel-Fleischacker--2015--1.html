practicing Jew. He talked about how he sees the Torah has teaching
that idolatry is the source of all the evil and unhappiness in the
world and that all the stories in it point in that direction. In
the beginning of the chapter, he talked about what the point of a
religion would be and why one would join one. This made me think
about what the big picture of *REDACTED*ism is and also whether one
could make a religion that would inspire space travel and
colonization of the universe.

I am predisposed to prefer *REDACTED*ism for this purpose, so I was
thinking about how to read *REDACTED*ism in that way and so
on. Something that strikes me about the Book of *REDACTED* is how often
the plot is about a family fleeing destruction and going to a new
place as pioneers, then thinking about what the problems that
happen there are. The Lehites do this, then the Nephites do it,
then the people of King Noah do it, and we see people do this off
screen as the ships travel away and never return. The various
accounts talk about the dangers that exist when you are away, like
forgetting your traditions, fighting with the locals, having kings,
and so on. The people in the Book of *REDACTED* demonstrate how to
receive and learn from this lesson, because they find the record of
the Jaredites (who went through the same process) and try to learn
from it. They mostly succeed in following the advice, but they also
fundamentally fail. A theme of the Book of *REDACTED* is that we can do
a lot by ourselves, but also need help. For instance, Nephi is very
capable, but also needs help in various ways. When the Brother of
Jared makes the lights for his barges, this is an example of that.

This reading of the Book of *REDACTED* also applies to *REDACTED* history
in as much as the history of the Pioneers is part of our
scriptures: they flee destruction by going to new place and have
many problems when they get there, including with the people that
are there already, but also amongst themselves. Even though it was
painful, perhaps some of the outside meddling was very useful, like
destroying the Oligarchy of Polygamy and introducing technological
innovations.

Similarly, if you think about the Plan of Salvation, it has a
similar feeling, because we had lives before but they were
meaningless in a deep way without the growth that came by coming
here. Likewise, the role of Jesus and prophets are that they assist
us in fulfilling the purpose of our journey.

Lastly, we try to recreate this experience for children when they
go on missions. We send them with help and helpers from home, but
they are on their own mostly and have to discover how to
flourish. Most missionaries I have talked to find that following
the "Mosaic law" of their presidents is not the best course for
their spiritual growth and that's part of what they learn.

The most important part of this way of thinking is how it pushes us
in a direction in the future. I think that this can be applied in a
microcosm every time we go to a new place or new part of our life:
we can learn from our heritage about how to behave. But, it is also
preparing us to go to a frontier that we are truly scared of and
have no knowledge about: space and colonization.

This drive to expand and explore is tied in to the *REDACTED*
conception of the good because we are trying to be like our creator
by creating and inhabiting worlds and that this is not
self-aggrandizement, but is a way of helping others and expanding
his glory.
