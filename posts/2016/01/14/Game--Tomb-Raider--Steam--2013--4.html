I decided not to go back and explore
all the previous areas. Primarily, because I didn't see the value
in the further finding of relics and that sort of thing. I regret
a tiny bit not finding more letters during the course of play, as
the story details could have been fun. I did all the Tombs and
wasn't particularly blown away by them, although they were fun.

Overall, I was very happy with the game and thought it was
great. I will play the next one and I'm considering playing the
Uncharted games because I've heard they are similar to
this. (However, if they are like The Last of Us, then I would be
turned off.) In particular, I like how I'm familiar with the
character of Lara Croft and they do a good job of making her
fresh, interesting, and reasonably respectable in this game. I
really liked how in the last moments she had her iconic double
handguns.

As a game, I thought the platforming and puzzle elements were
great. The traversal was fun and efficient and full of little
micro-puzzles, like Zelda. I thought the combat was very
nerve-wracking because aiming was just a bit too slow compared to
what the enemies doled out at you. I think this produced the right
feeling in me as a player, but I think it has comic character
consequences as Lara is now a mass murderer. I found the first
fifth and second half of the game (defined as when she gets back
to the boat) to be the most annoying combat-wise. The first part
was annoying because of no melee abilities so you have to back up,
shoot, back up, etc. The second part was annoying because enemies
totally swarmed you and it was very frenetic. The worst parts of
the game were when the QTEs were unbeatable or otherwise
bugged. Even in the last 'boss fight' against the big Stormguard,
his ending QTE wouldn't work for me. (The button prompt on the
right happened instantly.) Eventually I just tried it over and
over again and made it work by pure luck and guessing without
seeing. (That was totally absurd, by the way, because I'm to
believe that a gunshot to head is less lethal than an axe to the
head... when I've put twenty into it just to get the QTE to
restart.)

As a story, I think it was exactly what it needed to be. She's
thrust into circumstances and she was must survive, all while
being an Indiana-Jones-type character with discovery and little
supernatural elements. I think the only annoyance with the plot is
that I knew what Mathias was doing basically instantly and it
takes Lara until almost the last scene to figure it out. I think
it is a tad ridiculous and makes her look stupid. I suppose the
thing is that I know it's a video game and can have supernatural
things, but for Lara it is reality so she doesn't want to believe
in the supernatural, but still... jeepers she's thick.
