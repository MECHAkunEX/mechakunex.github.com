I really did not like the end game at
all. I was very annoyed that they took away Machine and Rem, who I
had put a ton of effort into improving. Even worse, they didn't
put their accessories back into my inventory, so I lost my most
powerful accessories and couldn't use them with the other
characters. I managed to get to the Chapel of Destruction and do
two of the rooms before everyone died. I was going to give up or
try using a Phoenix Down, but Cid revived everyone and I stomped
through the end. I was also annoyed that the end game made me do
the special challenges and gave no indication of what was going to
be expected; for instance, I went in to the room with the "Use
only magic attacks" with a party that had no magic users, had to
get them killed, and then barely scraped by with three characters
that had access to magic. It was lame. The final story beats were
really confusing and weird. It was a little beautiful and nice how
chummy the Class Zero students were, but I was let down overall
with the story.

I feel like the gameplay was very good, but there were lots of
messy things about the game that pulled down my enjoyment of it.
