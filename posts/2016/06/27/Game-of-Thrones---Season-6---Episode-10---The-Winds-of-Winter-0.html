It's cool that she just shows up and
there's no depiction of her journey there. I expect that in the
next season, she will not interact with her family, but will
focus on killing Cersei and that drama will be the main action of
her arc. Either, she will die in the process or she will be
secret thing that saves those who oppose Cersei.

It was so epic how the plot lines in King's Landing got
resolved. It's amazing that Cersei really accomplished it and did
so much all at once. I don't quite understand why Cersei killed
Pycelle, I suppose because he is so opportunistic and not
reliable. Cersei's new outfit looks awesome and she's like a
warrior. It's interesting how many of the Lannisters are now
dead. In particular, Cersei basically has no point to her life
anymore, because she's defined herself as advancing her kids for
so long... what's the point now? I think she is going to be
totally unpredictable at this point, as if she wasn't
unpredictable already. I expect that her main action will be
defense and going on a rampage against the North and Dany.

Sam's scene was great. I wonder what awesome things he'll learn
there. Of course, if he wasn't going to learn anything, then
there would be no point for his plot to be followed.

It is nice to have confirmation that Jon Snow is a Targaryen and
a Stark. I hope that this means that Jon will marry Dany as a way
to wed the North to her new dynasty it a bit of a twist as
afterwards Bran will reveal to him his patrimony and the
Targaryen practice of intermarriage (in this case, Aunt and
Nephew) will continue.

I liked Bran's conversation with Benjen, especially because I
daftly did not realize before that Benjen was dead. Bran seems
like he is safe, so he'll be able to get to Winterfell safely,
then I expect Jon will let him be the Lord there. Hopefully he
can do some cool warging as part of the battle.

I like Melisandre as a character and hope that she will not
totally go away. I doubt we've heard the last from her and
hopefully she will support Dany as her sister have in Esteros.

Lyanna *REDACTED*t is so awesome. I loved her monologue. I wonder
what sinister thoughts Littlefinger is having.

I didn't catch at first that Varys's offer of "Fire and Blood"
was a reference to the Targaryens. Cool.

I nearly cried when Dany gave Tyrion the Hand of the Queen
brooch. So cool. They're going to be an awesome team. What an
awesome ending. I expect that she can't possibly invade King's
Landing directly, because then there wouldn't be enough drama.

I expect that the next season will end the Game of Thrones and
transition into purely fighting the Night King. It seems like
there are four factions: Cersei, Littlefinger, Jon, and
Dany. Clearly, Cersei is opposed to Jon and Dany. Jon and Dany
can be definitely be aligned. However, I would not put it past
Littlefinger to weasel his way in and offer the support of the
Vale. Especially given that he wants to rule. He might marry her,
but he's not reliable.

I expect that all the living Starks will be united in Winterfell
by the end of next season, the main question being whether Arya
will live.     </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
