The
game is very cute and I really like the style. I like the concept
of it much more than I like the actual gameplay. I really like
that you are in way more control than in other RPGs, because you
can just say that you want to be in a fight and what you want to
fight. The problem with this, however, is that you can really
'game' it by ensuring that you are fully rested before every fight
and thus remove the meta-game the developers tried to put in. The
game claims that the day makes it more difficult, but I didn't see
any evidence of that.

The root of the problem is that it is clearly designed as a mobile
tablet game. The interface is entirely mouse-focused, and so it is
very inefficient to click an attack button, select the attack,
select the enemy and repeat. The worst part is that all the
enemies on the screen are labeled with numbers, but you can't type
the number for that enemy to be selected. It is pretty
ridiculous.

I found it so infuriating (and physically painful on my hands) to
play this way that I got the rug option (very cute, by the way,
that the game room decor affects the play) that makes the battles
auto-play. This essentially turned the game into a "clicker" where
I just watch numbers go up and then make a few choices about which
upgrade to get next.

The traces of micro-transactions are all over the game, because
the exciting things in the store cost a lot of gold and you really
don't get that much from every battle. Furthermore, a lot of stuff
is all about temporary effects based on time, which is really
gross.

I feel pretty bad buying this game so long ago and never playing
it and now finding out that it is not worth it. Because the
purchase is so far in the past and a sunk-cost, I don't even know
what price I paid for it, so it feels very disposable. Maybe if I
had played closer to release, I would have felt a bigger
compulsion to complete it, but I don't think I would have actually
enjoyed that. I suppose I just would have had the ability to
return it.
