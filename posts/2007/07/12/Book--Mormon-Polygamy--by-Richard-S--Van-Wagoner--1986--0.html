polygamy in *REDACTED* in the 1800s, with emphasis on how the
average polygamist actually lived---rather than about the
origin/development of the practice and its theological
underpinnings. There was a bit of this in the book, but
not as much as I expected. (Chapter Nine is probably the
best source of this sort of information.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting comment made by John Rigdon,
Sidney's son: "[My father] was not a leader of men... the
*REDACTED* Church... made no mistake in placing Brigham Young
at the head of the church... if Sidney Rigdon had been
chosen to take that position the Church would have
tottered and fallen." (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter Nine indicates that the author did research
about courting patterns and living relationships, but he
gives no anecdotes or data, so one feels very empty after
he writes "courtship manners were not well established",
and leaves it at that. (p. 90) I found it interesting the
disparity in number of polygamous families in different
areas: 40% in St. George, but only 11% in nearby
Harrisburg. (p. 91)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to learn that women were not
discouraged to divorce their husbands, that men could not
divorce their wives, and they were responsible for their
wives and children's welfare perpetually. (p. 93)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a discussion on the law of Sarah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel though unsuccessful attempt to get a
second wife was initiated by an elder from
southern *REDACTED*. Young reported that the fearful man
hesitated to ask permission of his feisty
wife. "Finally, he told her he had had a
revelation to marry a certain girl and that in the
face of such divine instructions, she must give
her consent." He had obviously underestimated the
ingenuity of his wife, who announced the next
morning that she had received a revelation to
"shoot any woman who became his plural wife." He
remained monogamous. [p. 96]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also mentioned was Brigham Young says that "a Man may
embrace the Law of Celestial Marriage in his heart &amp;amp;
not take the second wife &amp;amp; bee justified before the
Lord." (p. 104)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The book is printed very well on
nice, thick pages.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1986/">1986</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
