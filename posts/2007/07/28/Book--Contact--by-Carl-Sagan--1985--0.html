movie. The movie is significantly different, but I think
that they changes made in the movie make the story
better. I make the distinction between things that were
absent (e.g., the debates and scientific details) and the
things that were changed (e.g., five passengers rather
than one, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read this book, I interpret a major theme as
Sagan's internal conflict with faith and his crusade
against "organized" religions. While I have no critique of
his handling of his conflict---although I would refer him
to read William James again---I do have a problem with his
attacks on religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, he does not attack the strongest religious
people, but rather the weakest. While these caricatures
are surely somewhat accurate, and represent people one
could argue with, they do little to convince. I cannot
fault him for not knowing how I reconcile faith and
science, but I do fault him for obviously not doing his
research on the groups he chooses to attack. For example,
consider this non-sense comment: "The *REDACTED* Church
declared it [the Message] a second revelation of the angel
Moroni."  (p. 128) Any one with an even rudimentary
knowledge of *REDACTED*ism would recognize this as an absurd
thing to say: we have a whole book of revelations from God
to Joseph Smith and his successors and we receive
revelation daily. Such comments do not create trust in his
comments on other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a continual argument in his book that goes
like this: "If God wants us to believe in Him, why doesn't
He show Himself, or provide better proof?" Sagan even
offers a very clever method of proof: Give Moses (etc.) a
statement like "There is no privileged frame of reference"
or other scientific statements that could not be known in
his time, but could be verified later. (p. 163) However,
it is an ancient understanding in theology that such proof
would be paramount to coercion and deny humans the ability
to exercise faith and free agency. I think it represents a
fundamental misunderstanding of God: He does not want us
to "behave", but wants us to "grow" and the various
commandments are pursuant to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these complaints, I recommend the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found very enjoyable Hadden's discussion of Earth and
a 'control' planet to show to 'apprentice gods' to warn
them of what a bad job is. (p. 286) Also, his idea that
immortals are extremely risk-averse (p. 293), of course by
immortality, meaning great ability to cure the body, but
still fundamentally vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;	    	    </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1985/">1985</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
