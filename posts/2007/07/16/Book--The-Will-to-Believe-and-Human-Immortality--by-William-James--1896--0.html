justification of faith and free-will, as opposed to
"science" and determinism. In the preface, James
writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some rationalizing readers such advocacy
will seem a sad misuse of one's professional
position. Mankind, they will say, is only too
prone to follow faith unreasoningly, and needs no
preaching nor encouragement in that direction. I
quite agree that what mankind at large most lacks
is criticism and caution, not faith. [...] But
academic audiences, fed already on science, have a
very different need. Paralysis of their native
capacity for faith and timorous abulia in the
religious field are their special forms of mental
weakness, brought about be the notion, carefully
instilled, that there is something called
scientific evidence by waiting upon which they
shall escape all danger of shipwreck in regard to
truth. [p. x-xi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity
loses the prize as surely as if he tried and
failed. [p. 4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Cliffords tell us how sinful it is to
be Christians on such 'insufficient evidence',
insufficiency is really the last thing they have
in mind. For them the evidence is absolutely
sufficient, only it makes the other way. They
believe so completely in an anti-christian order
of the universe that there is no living option:
Christianity is a dead hypothesis from the
start. [p. 14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scepticism, then, is not avoidance of option;
it is option of a certain particular kind of
risk. Better risk loss of truth than chance of
error, --- that is your faith-vetoer's exact
position. [p. 26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On scepticism has a principle of thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A] rule of thinking which would absolutely
prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of
truth if those kinds of truth were really there,
would be an irrational rule. [p. 28]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe being larger than we recognize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My terrier bites a teasing boy, for example,
and the father demands damages. The dog may be
present at every step of the negotiations, and see
the money paid, without an inkling of what it all
means, without a suspicion that it has anything to
do with him; and he never can know in his natural
dog's life. [p. 57-58]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is practically from the Book of *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith means belief in something concerning
which doubt is still theoretically possible; and
as the test of belief is willingness to act, one
may say that faith is the readiness to act in a
cause the prosperous issue of which is not
certified to us in advance. It is in fact the same
moral quality which we call courage in practical
affairs; [p. 90]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot live or think at all without some
degree of faith. Faith is synonymous with working
hypothesis. [p. 95]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are then cases where faith creates its
own verification. Believe, and you shall be right,
for you shall save yourself; doubt, and you shall
again be right, for you shall perish. The only
difference is that to believe is greatly to your
advantage. [p. 97 --- he uses the example making a
jump from a cliff.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moral question is a question not of what
sensibly exists, but of what is good, or would be
good if it did exists. Science can tell us what
exists; but to compare the worths, both of what
exists and of what does not exists, we must
consult not science, but what Pascal calls our
heart. [p. 22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a compelling refutation of evolution as a
morality around page 99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we not bound to take some suffering upon
ourselves, to do some self-denying service with
our lives, in return for all those lives upon
which ours are built? [p. 50]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determinism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James says that the essence of determinism is that
possibility is a false idea. Anything
that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, is the only way it could be, so
possibilities do not exist. There are only a priori
uncertainties. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also writes that science cannot decide
determinism, because it is only concerned with things
that happen, and can say nothing about things that do
not happen. (p. 152) This has implications for regret
and "ought", because if there is only one possibility
how can we rationally regret or hope for anything?
(p. 175-176)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular essay, he mentions the
intriguing idea that the purpose of the universe is
not to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; good ends, but rather to learn
what good and evil are. "Life is one long eating of
the fruit of the tree of knowledge." (p. 165)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James writes about how indeterminism does not
prevent God from being all-powerful, because he could
have an infinite number of contingency plans to meet
his ends, each depending on some particular set of
indeterminate outcomes. He compares God to an expert
chess player who is facing a novice. (p. 181)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historicism and Great Men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these essays, James argues that ignoring
individuals and focusing on environments and trends,
is like ignoring gravity and focusing on air
turbulence, the position of Saturn, and Western
Civilization when asking what will happen to a falling
bowling-ball. Those are certainly components of a
complete explanation, but their effect is miniscule
compared to gravity and our finite brains cannot
consider them all. (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
