book, I thought of this book. Now, it has been my
privilege to read it. Something interesting about the
book, actually surprising, is that Gibbon assumes you
know &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about the Roman world. It is
definitely only about the decline of the empire, rather
than the empire or the republic in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the introduction, Lord Dacre quotes this
understatement by Gibbon regarding his trip to Rome during
his youth: "I do not despair of being able one day to
produce something by way of a description of ancient Italy
which may be of some use to the public and of some credit
to myself."  (pp. lxvi-lxvii) He continues about how
moving it was for him: "If it was difficult before to give
you or Mrs. Gibbon any account of what I saw, it is
impossible here... I am really almost in a dream. Whatever
ideas books may have given us of the greatness of that
people, their accounts of the most flourishing state of
Rome fall infinitely short of the picture of its ruins. I
am convinced that there never, never existed such a
nation, and &lt;strong&gt;I hope for the happiness of mankind
that there never will again&lt;/strong&gt;." (p. lxviii)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago when I decided to take a trip by myself
to Europe, the only place I even considered for a second
was Rome. I normally uninterested in scenic tours and the
like, thinking I can get more out of a book, but with Rome
it was different. There is something appallingly awing
about being there. The grandeur of what happened in Rome
is just so fabulous. Standing near where Caesar was
assassinated... wow. The closest experience I can imagine,
that I've experienced, is being in the Sacred Grove in
Palmyra, New York---where God and Jesus Christ appeared to
Joseph Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plausibility of the barbarian destroyers: "'If
all the barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the
same hour, their total destruction would not have restored
the empire of the West.' It had been rotted from within."
(p. xci)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, as a cause and symptom of
corruption, Gibbon singled out monasticism. Some
of his most brilliant chapters, and his most
sustained irony, are reserved for the spread of
this Egyptian plague, as he called it, over the
Roman Empire. [...] Monasticism, he wrote roundly,
had, in a later age, 'counter-balanced all the
temporal advantages of Christianity.' For
monasticism, he believed, was parasitic not only
on society but also on the Church, whose `temporal
advantages' --- i.e., whose constructive social
function --- he would admit. It withdrew the
resources of society, both human and economic,
from that free and useful circulation on which
progress depended. It condemned men to idleness,
immobilized wealth, kept land in mortmain. And it
positively undermined the very idea of civic
virtue. [p. xcii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] Instead of active participation the early
Church preached, and the early monks practised,
deliberate withdrawal from public life. Such
withdrawal was not then justified by any other
useful activity. The monks were not learned, they
did not teach, the fulfilled no social function,
they founded no industry, they tilled no land,
they cleared no waste. Their retreat from activity
was absolute, and to Gibbon it was contemptible
and disgusting: a degradation of the human spirit,
a denial of social duty, a refusal to face the
challenge of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] At a time when the fate of civilization
hung in the balance, the Christian clergy
`successfully preached the doctrines of patience
and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society
were discouraged; and the last remains of the
military spirit were buried in the cloister.'
Later Western monks might use the cloister as a
means to preserve, through a dark age, the relics
of ancient literature; but the Eastern monks of
the fourth century had no such redeeming
virtue. [p. xciii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtue of the Roman Republic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That public virtue which among the ancients was
denominated patriotism, is derived from a strong
sense of our own interest in the preservation and
prosperity of the free government of which we are
members. Such a sentiment, which had rendered the
legions of the republic almost invincible, could
make but a very feeble impression on the mercenary
servants of a despotic prince; and it became
necessary to supply that defect by other motives,
of a different, but not less forcible nature;
honour and religion. [p. 13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the legions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active valour may often by the present of
nature; but such patient diligence can be the
fruit only of habit and discipline. [p. 21]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion in the Empire before Constantine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy of the emperors and the senate, as
far as it concerned religion, was happily seconded
by the reflections of the enlightened, and by the
habits of the superstitious, part of their
subjects. The various modes of worship, which
prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered
by the people, as equally true; by the
philosopher, as equally false; and by the
magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration
produced not only mutual indulgence, but even
religious concord. [p. 34]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibbon discusses how Augustus consolidated power, but
never took the name of king:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of king had armed the Romans against
his life. Augustus was sensible that mankind is
governed by names; nor was he deceived in his
expectation, that the senate and the people would
submit to slavery, provided that they were
respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their
ancient freedom. A feeble senate and enervated
people cheerfully acquiesced in the pleasing
illusion, as long as it was supported by the
virtue, or even the prudence, of the successors of
Augustus. It was a motive of self-preservation,
not a principle of liberty, that animated the
conspirators against Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian. They attacked the person of the tyrant,
without aiming their blow at the authority of the
emperor. [p. 83]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many a man would relate this to the American
Presidency, but I would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the horrible Commodus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodus had now attained the summit of vice
and infamy. Amidst the acclamations of a
flattering court, he was unable to disguise, from
himself, that he had deserved the contempt and
hatred of every man of sense and virtue in his
empire. [p. 108]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imperatorship of Pertinax is very sadly
recounted. (p. 112-115)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proconsul's progeny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a
library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested to
the variety of his inclinations, and from the
productions which he left behind him, it appears
that the former as well as the latter were
designed for use rather than ostentation. (By each
of his concubines, the younger Gordian left three
or four children. His literary productions were by
no means contemptible.) [p. 196]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intriguing remark on the junta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, indeed, it may be laid down as a
general rule, that a military government is, in
some respects, more republican than
monarchical. Nor can it be said that the soldiers
only partoke of the government by their
disobedience and rebellions. The speeches made to
them by the emperors, were they not at length of
the same nature as those formerly pronounced to
the people by the consuls and the tribunes? And
although the armies had no regular place or forms
of assembly; though their debates were short,
their action sudden, and their resolves seldom the
result of cool reflection, did they not dispose,
with absolute sway, of the public fortune? What
was the emperor, except the minister of a violent
government elected for the private benefit of the
soldiers? [p. 213]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalling the barbarian traditions: "In the general
festival that was solemnised every ninth year, nine
animals of every species (without excepting the human)
were sacrificed, and their bleeding bodies suspended in
the sacred grove adjacent to the temple." (p. 268)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diocletian's remarks on the problems of a prince:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`How often,' was he accustomed to say, `is it
the interest of four or five ministers to combine
together to deceive their sovereign! Secluded from
mankind by his exalted dignity, the truth is
concealed from his knowledge; he can see only with
their eyes, he hears nothing but their
misrepresentations. He confers the most important
offices upon vice and weakness, and disgraces the
most virtuous and deserving among his subjects. By
such infamous arts,' added Diocletian, `the best
and wisest princes are sold to venal corruption of
their courtiers.' [p. 429]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legendary chapter on Christianity really is quite
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for
defence, but it was never designed for conquest;
and it seems probable that the number of
proselytes was never much superior to that of
apostates. [p. 492]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tertullian on the persecutors of Christians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condemnation of the wisest and most
virtuous of the Pagans, on account of their
ignorance or disbelief of the divine truth, seems
to offend the reason and the humanity of the
present age. (70) But the primitive church, whose
faith was of a much firmer consistence, delivered
over, without hesitation, to eternal torture the
far greater part of the human species. A
charitable hope might perhaps be indulged in
favour of Socrates, or some other sages of
antiquity, who had consulted the light of reason
before that of the Gospel had arisen.(71) But it
was unanimously affirmed that those who, since the
birth or the death of Christ, had obstinately
persisted in the worship of the daemons, neither
deserved nor could expect a pardon from the
irritated justice of the Deity. These rigid
sentiments, which had been unknown to the ancient
world, appear to have infused a spirit of
bitterness into a system of love and harmony. The
ties of blood and friendship were frequently torn
asunder by the difference of religious faith; and
the Christians, who, in this world, found
themselves oppressed by the power of the Pagans,
were sometimes seduced by resentment and spiritual
pride to delight in the prospect of their future
triumph. "You are fond of spectacles," exclaims
the stern Tertullian, "expect the greatest of all
spectacles, the last and eternal judgment of the
universe. How shall I admire, how laugh, how
rejoice, how exult, when I behold so many proud
monarchs, and fancied gods, groaning in the lowest
abyss of darkness; so many magistrates, who
persecuted the name of the Lord, liquefying in
fiercer fires than they ever kindled against the
Christians; so many sage philosophers blushing in
red hot flames with their deluded scholars; so
many celebrated poets trembling before the
tribunal, not of Minos, but of Christ; so many
tragedians, more tuneful in the expression of
their own sufferings; so many dancers - " But the
humanity of the reader will permit me to draw a
veil over the rest of this infernal description,
which the zealous African pursues in a long
variety of affected and unfeeling
witticisms. [p. 518]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On conversion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The careless Polytheist, assailed by new and
unexpected terrors, against which neither his
priests nor his philosophers could afford him any
certain protection, was very frequently terrified
and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures. His
fears might assist the progress of his faith and
reason; and if he could once persuade himself to
suspect that the Christian religion might possibly
be true, it became an easy task to convince him
that it was the safest and most prudent party that
he could possibly embrace. [p. 541]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reputation of Christians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the new converts had been enrolled in the
number of the faithful, and were admitted to the
sacraments of the church, they found themselves
restrained from relapsing into their past
disorders by another consideration of a less
spiritual but of a very innocent and respectable
nature. Any particular society that has departed
from the great body of the nation, or the religion
to which it belonged, immediately becomes the
object of universal as well as invidious
observation. In proportion to the smallness of its
numbers, the character of the society may be
affected by the virtue and vices of the persons
who compose it; and every member is engaged to
watch with the most vigilant attention over his
own behaviour, and over that of his brethren,
since, as he must expect to incur part of the
common disgrace, he may hope to enjoy a share of
the common reputation. [p. 525]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, *REDACTED*s are in a similar situation. This
is an idea that is commonly preached actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tertullian on shaving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The] practice of shaving the beard, which,
according to the expression of Tertullian, is a
lie against our own faces, and an impious attempt
to improve the works of the Creator. [p. 528]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best and most ironic ending ever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how shall we excuse the supine inattention
of the Pagan and philosophic world to those
evidences which were presented by the hand of
Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their
senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles,
and of their first disciples, the doctrine which
they preached was confirmed by innumerable
prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw, the
sick were healed, the dead were raised, daemons
were expelled, and the laws of Nature were
frequently suspended for the benefit of the
church. General silence concerning the darkness of
the passion.But the sages of Greece and Rome
turned aside from the awful spectacle, and,
pursuing the ordinary occupations of life and
study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in
the moral or physical government of the
world. Under the reign of Tiberius, the whole
earth,(194) or at least a celebrated province of
the Roman empire, (195) was involved in a
preternatural darkness of three hours. Even this
miraculous event, which ought to have excited the
wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of
mankind, passed without notice in an age of
science and history.(196) It happened during the
lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who must
have experienced the immediate effects, or
received the earliest intelligence, of the
prodigy. Each of these philosophers, in a
laborious work, has recorded all the great
phenomena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets,
and eclipses, which his indefatigable curiosity
could collect. (197) Both the one and the other
have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to
which the mortal eye has been witness since the
creation of the globe. A distinct chapter of Pliny
(198) is designed for eclipses of an extraordinary
nature and unusual duration; but he contents
himself with describing the singular defect of
light which followed the murder of Caesar, when,
during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the
sun appeared pale and without splendour. This
season of obscurity, which cannot surely be
compared with the preternatural darkness of the
Passion, had been already celebrated by most of
the poets(199) and historians of that memorable
age.(200) [p. 565-566]&lt;/p&gt;
