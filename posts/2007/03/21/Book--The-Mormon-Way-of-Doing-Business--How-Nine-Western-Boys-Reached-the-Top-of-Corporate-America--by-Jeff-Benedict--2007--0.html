*REDACTED* and talks about their life and how *REDACTED* values
have helped them. In the beginning, there is a lot that I
think is accurately attributed to their religion, but near
the middle and end, a lot of the book becomes more about
the guys, than their religion, which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the book seem thrown together: There
were a few (5 or 6) typos and there was a lot of duplicate
use of quotes in different chapters. This last problem
might come from the *REDACTED* tendency to regard the
Scriptures and quote the same ones in many contexts, but
to me it is a faux pas in such a short book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it's a problem that can be resolved with
money, it's not a problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning sixteen-year-old Katie Checketts
was running late for seminary class when she
hurried to the garage, started up the Chevy Tahoe,
threw it into reverse---and rammed into the garage
door that she had forgotten to open. Instead of
going inside and reporting the accident to her
mother, she pulled forward, hit the automatic door
opener button, and raised the wooden door. As the
door came up, the broken door destroyed the metal
tracking, sending splintered boards and metal
everywhere. Then she backed over the debris and
left for seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checketts returned home from an out-of-town
business trip later that day. He had undergone a
particularly difficult week at work and arrived
home in a bad mood. The first thing he saw was a
heap of wood and overhead metal tracks lying in
the garage. He burst into the house and demanded
to know what had happened to the garage door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family assembled and his daughter recounted
the story. Checketts could feel his blood boiling
as he listened. His daughter and the other kids
could see the anger in his eyes. Then he
remembered Bill Bain's words: If it's a problem
that can be solved with money, it's not a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Honey," Checketts said to his daughter, "it
just occurred to me that when I took driver's ed
many years ago, at no time did anybody ever say to
me: `Before you back out of the garage, open the
door.' And I'm sure no one ever said it to
you. Well, now you know."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a pause. Then the entire family burst
out in laughter and cheers. The problem had gone
away. [p. 111]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disgust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checketts' mother also encouraged him to seek
leadership positions in school. When he ran for
class president, his mother wrote his campaign
speeches, calling on words from Franklin Roosevelt
and John F. Kennedy. One of the speeches she wrote
for her son began: "Ask not what your school can
do for you, but what you can do for your school."
[p. 165]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I think that's the first time that had ever
been used in a school. I am appalled that this is
cited as a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in this book is quite admirable. Two thumbs
up.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2007/">2007</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
