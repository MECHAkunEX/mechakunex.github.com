A few choice quotes from
his &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom'&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;
page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new poet becomes inspired to write because he
has read and admired the poetry of previous poets;
but this admiration turns into resentment when the
new poet discovers that these poets whom he
idolized have already said everything he wishes to
say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloom believes that the goals of reading must
be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight
rather than the "forces of resentments'" goal:
improvement of one's society, which he casts as an
absurd aim, writing "The idea that you benefit the
insulted and injured by reading someone of their
own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one
of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our
schools." His position, stated simply, is that
politics have no place in literary criticism: a
feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet, for
example, would tell us something about feminism
and Marxism but nothing about Hamlet itself, it
being so universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book attempts to explain what the &lt;em&gt;genius&lt;/em&gt;
behind many great authors. It is a very subtle and the
answer (and method of getting there!) is never quite the
same. In fact, in many places the book is
incomprehensible. But amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why these one hundred? At one point I planned
many more, but one hundred came to seem
sufficient. Aside from those who could not be
omitted---Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Homer,
Vergil, Plato, and their peers---my choice is
wholly arbitrary and idiosyncratic. These are
certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; "the top one hundred," in
anyone's judgment, my own included. I wanted to
write about these. [p. ix]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the School of Resentment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of mediocrity, whatever its origins,
breeds mediocrity. [...] We do accept tables and
chairs whose legs fall off, no matter who
carpentered them, but we urge the young to study
mediocre writings, with no legs to sustain
them. [p. ix]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a sweeter person before our universities
yield to supposed social benignity and chose texts
for teaching largely on the basis of the racial
origin, gender, sexual orientation, and ethnic
affiliations of the New Authors, past and present,
whether or not they could write their way out of a
paper bag. [p. 50]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marxist academic cheerleaders waving their
pom-poms, reduce George Eliot as uselessly as the
reduce Shakespeare, with whom she shares many
qualities, including a mastery of dramatic
dialogue. [p. 627]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contemplate Shakespeare's genius is at once
to encounter the critic's despair and the critic's
ecstasy. [p. 18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Bloom could ask Shakespeare a question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Did] it comfort you to have fashioned women
and men more real than living men and women?
[p. 18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invasion of our reality by Shakespeare's
prime personages is evidence for the vitality of
literary characters, when created by genius. We
all know the empty sensation we experience when we
read popular fiction and find that there are only
names upon the page, but no persons. In time,
however overpraised, such fictions become period
pieces, and finally rub down into
rubbish. [p. 4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burgess wrote a play where Cervantes and Shakespeare
argue over who is greater. Cervantes responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not and it will never be. God is a
comedian. God does not suffer the tragic
consequences of a flawed essence. Tragedy is all
too human. Comedy is divine. [p. 38]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montaigne on being too old to get venereal
diseases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate that accidental repentance that old age
brings. I shall never be grateful to impotence for
any good it may do me... Miserable sort of remedy,
to owe our health to disease! [p. 41]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Plato:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLatonists are dangerous men and women, to
themselves and to other. Plato's &lt;cite&gt;Laws&lt;/cite&gt;
makes me uneasier than Deuteronomy does, or the
Koran at its fiercest. Great moralities too
swiftly turn savage, and I like it less and less,
after a half-century at Yale University, that like
all the other academic institutions of the
English-speaking world, its laws turn more and
more into a parody of Platonism. [p. 123]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparing Harry Potter and Shakespeare, Bloom quotes
Johnson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irregular combinations of fanciful
invention may delight a-while, by that novelty of
which the common satiety of life sends us all in
quest; but the pleasures of sudden wonder are soon
exhausted, and the mind can only repose on the
stability of truth. [p. 168]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard on the faithful husband:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He solves the great riddle of living in
eternity and yet hearing the hall clock strike,
and hearing it in such a way that the stroke of
the hour does not shorten but prolongs his
eternity. [p. 200]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crows maintain that a single crow could
destroy the heavens. There is no doubt of that,
but it proves nothing against the heavens, for
heave simply means: the impossibility of
crows. [p. 208]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flaubert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priest rose to take the crucifix; then she
stretched forward her neck like one suffering from
thirst, and glueing her lips to the body of the
Man-God, she pressed upon it with all her expiring
strength the fullest kiss of love that she had
ever given. Then he recited
the &lt;em&gt;Misereatur&lt;/em&gt; and
the &lt;em&gt;Indulgentiam&lt;/em&gt;, dipped his right thumb
in the oil, and began to give extreme
unction. First, upon the eyes, that had so coveted
all worldly goods; then upon the nostrils, that
had been so greedy of the warm breeze and the
scents of love; then upon the mouth, that had
spoken lies, moaned in pride and cried out in
lust; then upon the hands that had taken delight
in the texture of sensibility; and finally upon
the soles of the feet, so swift when she had
hastened to satisfy her desires, and that would
now walk no more. [p. 658-659]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never recovered from the initial wound I
received when first reading Borges's fictions some
forty years ago, but it seems always to be the
same wound. Borges would not regard that as his
limitation, but Shakespeare wounds us a thousand
different ways. [p. 682]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Devil owes everything to Milton." [p. 50,
Shelley]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christian epic in twelve books and many
thousands of lines devotes six words, broken by an
enjambment, to the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ! [p. 52, on Milton's &lt;cite&gt;Paradise
Lost&lt;/cite&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At seventy-one, I am perhaps not yet ready for
the &lt;cite&gt;Paradiso&lt;/cite&gt; (where, being of the
Jewish persuasion, I am not going to end anyway),
[p. 98, on Dante, of course]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other book seems so oddly and arbitrarily
arranged as [the Koran], which may be appropriate
because the voice that speaks the Koran is God's
alone, and who would dare to shape his utterances?
[p. 145]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysis is itself the illness of which
it purports to be the cure. [p. 179, Karl
Kraus]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austen however is Shakespeare's daughter: her
heroines defy historicizing contingecies, and are
among our rarest images of inward
freedom. [p. 284]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The universal condition of marriage: when
silence and conversation fuse.] [p. 329, on
Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Emerson is a sweet as barbed wire.] [p. 337,
quoting Angelo Bartlett Giamatti]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never has a poet, and storyteller, benefited so
greatly by translation. [p. 387, on Poe]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Swinburne is usually very annoying,
and we don't need a genius to annoy
us. [p. 427]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of the greatest art is that
imitations of it are legitimate, worthwhile,
tolerable; that it is not demolished or devoured
by them, or they by it. [p. 493, quoting Paul
Valery]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confronted with all that is vulgar and inept in
the present time, can we not take refuge in
cigarettes and adultery? [p. 656, quoting
Flaubert]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no children, I haven't transmitted the
legacy of our misery to any creature. [p. 679,
quoting Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad writing is bad for children, and the Harry
Potter books (Even if I am a minority of one on
this) are cliche-heavy period pieces, and will end
in dustbins. [p. 742, on how Lewis Carroll was
good children's literature]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sr. was a Swedenborgian only as so many
people I knew in my youth were Freudian; you had
dinner with them, or went to a movie together, and
they carried along a volume or two by the founder
of psychoanalysis. [p. 749, on Henry James]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
