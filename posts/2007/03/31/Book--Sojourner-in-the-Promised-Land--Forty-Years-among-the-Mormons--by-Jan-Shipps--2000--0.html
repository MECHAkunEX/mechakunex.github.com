history and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Shipps decided to use the research
methodology of the Kinsey Institute to study perceptions
of *REDACTED*s. She comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the populations whose opinions I would
need to track were no longer
living. Notwithstanding that stumbling block, I
reasoned that if I could find a means of accessing
the sources of information from which perceptions
would have to have been fashioned, there would be
no reason why I could not make use of survey
research methods to examine the history of
American perceptions of the *REDACTED*s across
time. [p. 46]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes a deal about how the *REDACTED*s were a "model
minority" --- more American than America. But not so any
longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is simply too much information being
published about what local Latter-day Saints are
doing (speaking at the Kiwanis Club, coaching
Little League teams, winning beauty contests,
sitting on school boards, being fined for
speeding; and so on) for members of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to retain their
status as a "model minority." Unquestionably,
*REDACTED*ism is rapidly losing the protection of
minority &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; status. [p. 112]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are *REDACTED*s Christian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[If] the members of one group of people
gathered into a community that calls itself
Christian are permitted to decide that a person or
everyone gathered into a different community that
likewise calls itself Christian is not Christian,
then some pretty un-Christian defining is going
on. [p. 340]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; agree, but I like the
principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, the early descriptions
of Salt Lake City are much like the witty
Irishman's reply when he was asked if Port Said
was the wickedest spot on earth. "Oh, my dear," he
said, "it's really a great deal wickeder than
that." [p. 72]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the church's full program involved the
Saints in so many meetings that a popular
definition of a *REDACTED* in those days was "someone
who is planning a meeting, going to a meeting,
sitting in a meeting, or coming from a meeting,"
[the new chapels] were in use day and night,
practically seven days a week. [p. 269]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
