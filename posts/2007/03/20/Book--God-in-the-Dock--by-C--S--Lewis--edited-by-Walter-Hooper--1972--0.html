&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common reproach against Christianity
that its dogmas are unchanging, while human
knowledge is in continual growth. Hence, to
unbelievers, we seem to be always engaged in the
hopeless task of trying to force the new knowledge
into moulds which it has outgrown. I think this
feeling alienates the outsider much more than any
particular discrepancies between this or that
doctrine and this or that scientific theory. We
may, as we say, `get over' dozens of isolated
`difficulties', but that does not alter his sense
that the endeavour as a whole is doomed to failure
and perverse: indeed, the more ingenious, the more
perverse. For it seems to him clear that, if our
ancestors had known what we know about the
universe, Christianity would never have existed at
all: and, however we patch and mend, no system of
thought which claims to be immutable can, in the
long run, adjust itself to our growing
knowledge. [p. 38]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis responds to another's opinion which is summarized
thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Corineus has advanced the charge that
none of us are in fact Christians at
all. According to him historic Christianity is
something so barbarous that no modern man can
really believe it: the moderns who claim to do so
are in fact believing a modern system of thought
which retains the vocabulary of Christianity and
exploits the emotions inherited from it while
quietly dropping its essential
doctrines. [p. 63]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the purpose of this argument is that
therefore it should be abolished, not that historic
Christianity should be &lt;em&gt;restored&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's consider Lewis's view of Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are to defend Christianity itself---the
faith preached by the Apostles, attested by the
Martyrs, embodied in the Creeds, expounded by the
Fathers. [p. 90]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice he does not say the truth or what was
testified by Christ, God the Father, or continually by
the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On old books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one has to chose between reading the new
books and reading the old, one must choose the
old: not because they are necessarily better but
because they contain precisely those truths of
which our own age is neglectful. [p. 92]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mistaken preference for the modern books
and this shyness of the old ones is nowhere more
rampant than in theology. Wherever you find a
little study circle of Christian laity you can be
almost certain that they are studying not St Luke
or St Paul or St Augustine or Thomas Aquinas
[curiously, a Saint at the time] or Hooker or
Butler, but M. Berdyaev or M. Maritain or Mr
Niebuhr or Miss Sayers or even
myself. [p. 201]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two heads are better than one, not because
either is infallible, but because they are
unlikely to go wrong in the same direction. To be
sure, the books of the future would be just as good
a corrective as the books of the past, but
unfortunately we cannot get at them. [p. 202]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is not eternal is eternally out of
date. [p. 10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a professional literary critic and I
thought [...] that the Gospels were certainly not
legends (in one sense they're not &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;
enough) [p. 101]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men fail so often to repent their real sins
that the occasional repentance of an imaginary sin
might appear almost desirable. [p. 189]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cause mieux quand on ne dit pas
Causons. [p. 280]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
