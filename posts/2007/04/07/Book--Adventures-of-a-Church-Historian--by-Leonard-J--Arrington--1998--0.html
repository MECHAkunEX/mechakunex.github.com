&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must not use history as a storehouse from
which deceptively simple moral lessons may be
drawn at random. [p. 237]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General authorities of the church and general
church officers, for reasons of policy or personal
preference, have chosen not to leave
autobiographical public records of their dealings
and associations with each other, so that church
members have no way of knowing what goes on inside
church headquarters. Do general authorities ever
disagree? What are they like as human beings when
they shed their official status as prophets,
seres, and revelators? Along with their
significant strengths are there also
weaknesses---or at least misunderstandings?
[p. 3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The words of truth [may be] hard ...; but the
righteous fear them not, for they love the truth
and are not shaken." [p. 6, 2 Nephi 9:40]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw no reason why a scholar should not have
access to [private records]. I could see no
evidence of private abuse of public funds; on the
contrary, the accounts seemed to be complete,
honest, and evidence of the sincere and devoted
service of church leaders and
members. [p. 17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summarized, "it is not that they disapprove
of &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; as Church Historian; they would
disapprove of any professional historian, any
intellectual, and independent-minded writer. They
want someone who (1) has written little history;
(2) saturates history with scriptural allusions
and references; and (3) obstinately refuses to
mention controversial episodes." [p. 156]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man in Holland read &lt;cite&gt;The *REDACTED*
Experience&lt;/cite&gt; and decided to join the
Church. (p. 194)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an amazing account of receiving the revelation
on the priesthood in 1978 in chapter 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny vignettes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Fielding Smith said King David was
constipated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that in the Book of Kinds it says
that King David sat on his throne for forty years
and was not moved. [p. 16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other church services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a Logan Stake president invited me to
speak in his stake priesthood leadership meeting
on the Church Welfare Plan. He then proceeded,
during the next half hour, to tell me what I
should say. Certain that he did not want me to
deviate one iota from his instruction, I finally
excused myself: "Sorry that I cannot make the
appointment; why don't &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; give the
talk?" [p. 41]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David O. McKay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [*REDACTED* State student stake center] was
dedicated in August 1959 by David O. McKay. On
that dry-as-dust day, the eighty-sex-year-old
president was assisted up a plank to an
observation platform by Bullen and the president
of the university, Daryl Chase. When McKay began
his talk he said he was "fit as a fiddle" but had
experience some difficulty getting on the platform
because he had to drag two others up with
him. [p. 46]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speaker at a meeting took too long before
Arrington could close the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time was up but Bullen, out of loyalty,
called on me for concluding remarks. I had a
prepared talk but I left it in my coat
pocket. "The gospel is true," I said, "and we will
all be blessed by living as we should. Amen" There
was a short prayer, and the conference was
over. Few dared tell me they liked my sermon
best. [p. 51-52]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Fielding Smith authorized a bishop in the
Logan Stake to use grape juice for the Sacrament!
(p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Joseph Anderson, an assistant to the Twelve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a gentle demeanor and quiet style and
his thin mustache was a trademark. When he was
first employed, facial hair was not uncommon:
Grant, George Albert Smith, and others had
beards. As styles changed, he found himself the
only general authority with a mustache. He worried
about it. When he was called to be an assistant to
the Twelve, he asked for advice, and was told to
shave. [p. 98]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said of his biography of Bishop Woolley by
warehouse employees of Deseret Book: "We loved
it..... It was the perfect size for packing."
(p. 137)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvin Dyer was ordained an apostle, but not a
member of the Twelve in 1967. Odd. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrington compares general authorities to officers
in the army with different privileges and
separation---like a class system. (p. 172-173)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigham Young does not think children should be
disciplined extremely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When children are bound too tightly and rigidly
to the moral law, he said, duty will become
loathsome to them, and "when they are freed by age
from the rigorous training of their parents, the
children are more fit for companions to devils
than to be the children of such religious
parents." [p. 205]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an informative account of the Mark Hoffman
affair in chapter 14. (p. 219-224)&lt;/p&gt;
