strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Peter Hulme:] "Humans beings who eat other
human beings have always been placed on the very
borders of humanity. They are not regarded
as &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;human because if they were animal
their behaviour would be natural and could not
cause the outrage and fear that `cannibalism' has
always provoked." [p. 15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He notes that in 1537, Pope Paul III issued three
bulls that Native Americans "were in fact rational
creatures and therefore `human beings'." [p. 15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best chapter, in my opinion, is &lt;cite&gt;Orthodoxy and
Heresy in American Religion&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the perennial question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harold Bloom is correct in saying *REDACTED*ism's
hallmark is its deliberate obliviousness to two
millennia of Christian tradition. So *REDACTED*ism
could be considered, in the context of
ecclesiastical history, emphatically not
Christian. [p. 81]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insight that something distinctive about
*REDACTED*ism is the universal access to the divine. In
contrast, Elizabeth Johnson writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of theology is replete with this
truth: recall Augustine's insight that if we have
understood, then what we have understood is not
God; Anselm's argument that God is that than which
nothing greater can be conceived; Hildegaard's
vision of God's glory as Living Light that blinded
her sight; Aquinas's working rulethat we can know
that God is and what God is not, but not what God
is, ... [p. 82]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas, in *REDACTED*ism: "The church is reintegrated
into the ongoing flow of human history, origins are
concrete and proximate, the process of doctrinal
formation is laid bare." (p. 83) And quoting Sterling
McMurrin on the *REDACTED* world-view, "from the
perspective of God there are no miracles." (p. 85)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it very interesting when Givens takes a
list of "behavioral traits" of destructive cults and
compares them to Christ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can hardly go unobserved that the New
Testament portrays a Christ who preached imminent
apocalypse (Matthew 24:15), reproved the scribes
and Pharisees as hypocrites (Matthew 23:13),
commanded his followers to preach the gospel to
all the world (Mark 16:15), commanded the rich
young man to give away all that he had (Mark
10:21), proclaimed himself the Messiah (Luke
4:21), exhorted his disciples to fast and pray
always (Mark 9:29; Luke 18:1), and so forth. And
yet here Christian heresy is defined in those very
terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is most curious that a "cult's" emulation of
early Christian forms is itself taken as prima
facie evidence of heresy, rather than as
potentially suggestive of authority. [p. 87]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of God in time again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What *REDACTED*ism and similar heresies did
challenge---implicitly---was the fantasy that
religious belief can circumvent its own historical
conceiving: the notion that God spoke to man, but
never in an actual moment in time or to a man who
was anyone's contemporary; the notion that the
canon records Gods word, but God never spoke a
precanonical utterance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Popular Christian thought seldom
encompasses the notion that the Apostles were
Christian (that is, disciples of Christ) before
there were councils, creeds, or even a New
Testament. [p. 89]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of *REDACTED*ism is striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith's unrelenting anthropomorphosizing; the
chronological and geographical specificity of his
encounters with the divine; his commitment of
heavenly revelation to the process of
transcription, publication, and marketing; his
enactment of prophetic restoration through the
medium of legal incorporation---these and related
aspects of Smith's work rendered religious
allegorizing of his message impossible. The stone
cut out of the mountain without hands and seen by
Daniel might have been an allegory, but its
fulfillment was not: It occurred "one thousand
eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh" (to
the day) when the Kingdom of God was "regularly
organized and established agreeable to the laws of
our country" (and the state of New York). When God
commanded Hosea to take a harlot as a wife, the
act presumably symbolized something about
spiritual apostasy and devotion (Hosea 1:2). But
when God commanded Joseph Smith to have Sidney
Gilbert "establish a store, that he [might] sell
goods," it was fruitless to search for other
levels of moral significance. [p. 90]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting episodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of anti-*REDACTED*ism has much to
distinguish it, both in the intensity and variety
of its manifestations and in the uniqueness of its
object. In no other case in American history has a
governor signed an order for the expulsion or
extermination of a segment of his state's own
citizenry (Governor Lilburn Boggs of Missouri in
1838), a state militia forced the evacuation of a
city of thousands (Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1847), the
United States sent an occupying army against its
citizens ("Buchanan's blunder", 1857-58) or
dissolved a church as a legal corporation and
disenfranchised thousands of its members
(Edmunds-Tucker Act, 1887). [p. 41]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his presidency, [Brigham] Young granted
1,645 divorces. [p. 144]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Givens recounts how after writing &lt;cite&gt;Uncle Tom's
Cabin&lt;/cite&gt;, Harriet Beecher Stowe went on to attack
*REDACTED*ism. (p. 146-147)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absurd Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that an altar of sacrifice was
actually built ... in the temple block, upon which
human sacrifices were to be made. - Senator Aaron
Harrison Cragin, on the U.S. Senate floor, May 18,
1870 [p. 13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville's traveling companion,
Gustave de Beaumont, was equally
unimpressed. "Nothing," he remarked, "is more
unusual than to see a Protestant minister with
white hair. The major goal that the American in
the ministry pursues is his own welfare and that
of his wife and children. When he has materially
improved his conditions, his end is achieved; he
retires." [p. 47]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an interfaith chapel, not an intercult
chapel," [a] minister told the Rocky Mountain
News. [p. 80, referring to Vail, Colorado]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They ain't whites ... They're *REDACTED*s."
[p. 135, quoting *REDACTED* London's &lt;em&gt;Star
Rover&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a refreshingly unscientific version of the
ethnicity theme, humorists found distinctive
physical commonalities of their own to fill the
function of distinctive racial
characteristics. Mark Twain, for example, claimed
that he had been an advocate of reform in *REDACTED*,
until he "saw the *REDACTED* women. Then I was
touched, ... and as I turned to hide the generous
moisture in my eyes, I said, 'No---the man that
marries one of them has done an act of Christian
charity ... and the man that marries sixty of them
has done a deed of open-handed generosity so
sublime that the nations of the earth should stand
uncovered in his presence and worship in
silence.'" And Oscar Wilde, in a letter to
Mrs. Bernard Beere (April 17, 1882), described the
*REDACTED*s he encountered on a visit to *REDACTED*: "They
... are very, very ugly." [p. 137]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[T]he one lesson to be learned from the morals
of Salt Lake City is that polygamy and immorality
are quite incompatible. The man with five wives
behaves himself with exemplary propriety. It is
the man with only one who spends all his spare
hours looking for the five he has not." [p. 149,
quoting a non-*REDACTED* visitor]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
