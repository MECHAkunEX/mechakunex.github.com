thought you knew about Indians is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early comment about the mounds in America that contain
pottery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounds cover such an enormous area that they
seem unlikely to be the byproduct of waste. Monte
Testaccio, the hill of broken pots southeast of Rome,
was a garbage dump for the entire imperial
city. Ibibate is larger than Monte Testaccio and but
one of hundreds of similar mounds. Surely the Beni did
not generate more waste than Rome [p. 7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On early reckonings of Native Americans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as if [they] had come across refugees from a
Nazi concentration camp, and concluded that they
belonged to a culture that had always been barefoot
and starving. [p. 10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mayan disintegration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, some of the last inscriptions are
gibberish, as if scribes had lost the knowledge of
writing and were reduced to meaningless imitation of
their ancestors. [p. 26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On trade with Indians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[They] would exchange [European goods] for cheap
furs of the sort used by Indians as blankets. It was
like happening upon a dingy kiosk that would swap
fancy electronic goods for customer' used
socks---almost anyone would be willing to overlook the
shopkeeper's peculiarities. [p. 34]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting discussion (around p. 46) on the
importance of property lines to the Patuxet and other
tribes. I find this appealing, given that so many people
say that when Europeans bought the land, the Indians
thought they were joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell I think like a *REDACTED*ertarian Economist when I
read this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inka did not even
have &lt;em&gt;markets&lt;/em&gt;. Economists would predict that
this nonmarket economy---vertical socialism, it has
been called---should produce gross
inefficiencies. These surely occurred, but the errors
were of surplus, not want. The Spanish invaders were
stunned to find warehouses overflowing with untouched
cloth and supplies. [p. 81]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fallacy. Since people have limited resources,
they have to decide between doing A or B. By choosing A,
they will have less B. Thus, those overflowing, untouched
warehouses represent a lack of something. This is an
example of a &lt;em&gt;Seen and Unseen&lt;/em&gt; fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of their inefficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Inka believe that idleness fomented
rebellion, ..., he ordered unemployed work brigades
"to move a mountain from one spot to another" for no
practical purpose. Cieza de Leon once came upon three
different highways running between the same two towns,
each built by a different Inka. [p. 84]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Inkan ruler worship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minions collected and stored every object he
touched, food waste included, to ensure that no lesser
person could profane these objects with their
touch. The ground was too dirty to receive the Inka's
saliva so he always spat into the hand of a
courtier. The courtier wiped the spittle with a
special cloth and stored it for safekeeping. Once a
year everything touched by the Inka---clothing,
garbage, bedding, saliva---was ceremonially
burned. [p. 82]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Inka died his panaqa [lineage] mummified
his body. Because the Inka was believed to be an
immortal deity, his mummy was treated, logically
enough, as if it were still living. Soon after
arriving in Qosqo, Pizarro's companion Miguel de
Estete saw a parade of defunct emperors. They were
brought out on litters, "seated on their thrones and
surrounded by pages and women with flywhisks in their
hands, who ministered to them with as much respect as
if they had been alive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the royal mummies were not considered dead,
their successors obviously could not inherit their
wealth. Each Inka's panaqa retained all of his
possessions forever, including his palaces,
residences, and shrines; all of his remaining clothes,
eating utensils, fingernail parings, and hair
clippings; and the tribute from the land he had
conquered. In consequence, as Pedro Pizarro realized,
"the greater part of the people, treasure, expenses,
and vices [in Tawantinsuyu] were under the control of
the dead." The mummies spoke through female mediums
who represented the panaqa's surviving courtiers or
their descendents. With almost a dozen immortal
emperors jostling for position, high-level Inka
society was characterized by ramose political intrigue
of a scale that would have delighted the
Medici. Emblematically, Wayna Qhapaq could not
construct his own villa on Awkaypata---his undead
ancestors had used up all available space. Inka
society had a serious mummy problem. [p. 98-99]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On pre-Columbian population:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Columbus sailed more people lived in the
Americas than in Europe. [p. 104]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, there is an interesting discussion on how
there is no conceivable way to have quarantined the New
World from the Old, so the disease disaster was basically
unavoidable. (p. 118)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people know that the Spanish destroyed much
Mesoamerican writing. What few people know is that the Mexica
destroyed their own writing, probably to hide their past as
poor. (p. 133)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*REDACTED*ism:&lt;/strong&gt; The Book of *REDACTED* is mentioned
once (p. 159, middle of the page, in a discussion on origin of
Native Americans), but the whole book makes me think about
it. In particular, the fact that are so many different
civilizations, helps me see how reasonable it is for the Book
of *REDACTED* civilization to have existed in the New World (the
main question would then be about the supernatural happenings
and the voyage.)  Furthermore, given that almost none of the
writing systems are extant or deciphereable, I am a nay-sayer
on finding secondary evidence of the Book of *REDACTED*'s
validity. And I think that is a good thing: it will keep faith
a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atacama Desert, just south of Peru on the
Chilean shore, is the driest place on earth---in some
places rain has literally never been recorded. Space
researchers use the Atacama as a model for the sands
of Mars. [p. 199]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting discussion of how the Norte Chico people
invented government, but there is no appearance of common
indulgences of states: monuments, etc. It seems that people
could easily get out of the power sphere, so the state had to
stay useful and out of the way. (p. 206-207)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On temples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a network of concealed vents and channels,
priests piped loud, roaring sounds at those who
entered the temple. Visitors walked up three flights
of stairs, growls echoing around them, and into a
long. windowless passageway. At the end of the
corridor, in a cross-shaped room that flickered with
torchlight, was a fifteen-foot-high stone figure with
a catlike face, taloned fingers, fierce tusks, and
Medusa hair. Nobody today is sure of the god's
identity. Immediately above it, hidden from visitor's
eyes, was a priestly functionary, who provided the
god's voice. After the long, torchlit approach,
walking straight into the gaze of the snarling deity,
mysterious bellows reverberating off the stone, the
oracular declamation from above must have been
spine-chilling. [p. 269]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice map of mounds on page 289.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the difficulty of studying monuments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piecing together events from these sources is like
trying to understand the U.S. Civil War from the
plaques on park statues: possible, but
tricky. [p. 303]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mayan environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So toxic is the groundwater, a U.S.-Mexican
research team remarked in 2002, that the Maya realm
was "geochemically hostile" to urban colonization. Its
occupation "more resembled settlement on the moon or
Antarctica than most other terrestrial habitats."
[p. 306]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Columbus, Indians were
a &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species'&gt;keystone
species&lt;/a&gt; in most of the hemisphere. [p. 353]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indians actually sought out pregnant or nursing
does, which hunters today are instructed to let
go. They hunted wild turkey in spring, just before
they laid eggs (if they had waited until the eggs
hatched, the poults could have survived, because they
will follow any hen). The effect was to remove
competition for tree nuts. The pattern was so
consistent, Neumann told me, that Indians must have
been purposefully reducing the number of deer,
raccoons, and turkeys. [p. 356]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
