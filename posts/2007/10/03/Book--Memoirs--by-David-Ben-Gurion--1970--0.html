This book contains his perspectives on the modern history of Israel, including vignettes about the founding of the state and those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very interesting stories and I feel like I understand what Israel meant to early settlers much more than I did previously. His emphasis on developing the Negev desert and calling for immigrants to be pioneers there is very interesting. Of course, I think of Brigham Young. He could have tried to focus all effort in Salt Lake City on manufacturing and higher-goods, but instead dreamt of a self-sustaining population. This dream, like Ben-Gurion's, required pioneers to develop an empty desert into usable farm-land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I find very curious about Ben-Gurion is that he quotes and cites the Bible so regularly, as well as is so profoundly concerned with being Jewish, yet is also very up-front with disbelieving completely in God. Throughout the book he will discuss some section of the Bible, then invert the meaning and deny the truthfulness of the prophet in question, yet still quote them approvingly. It is very strange to me that a person could be so concerned with creating a Jewish state, yet completely reject what I think of as what being Jewish is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plausible interpretation of this is that I clearly do not what being Jewish is, not having ever been Jewish. As we know, our civilization, and my faith in particular, have spent a lot of time co-opting and reinterpreting Jewish history, so I would naturally have a confused vision. However, by the Bible's own standards, one becomes a Jew by covenanting with YHWH, which Ben-Gurion clearly believes is silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more refined explanation of Ben-Gurion's opinions may come from his remark that "Remove Jewish history and there is no Judaism" (p. 21). In his mind, "all" being Jewish is is having this shared history, and that is inherently valuable. This reminds me of... New Order *REDACTED*s (if that is the correct category), those who have ceased to believe in the Gospel, yet are attached to their cultural identity as a *REDACTED*. In the past I have been supportive of these people staying in Church activity, even dishonestly, on the hope that they would regain the spirit in their life. While I think that is still possible, if they allow that possibility, reading Ben-Gurion's book gives me a vision of the "*REDACTED*" people reclaiming *REDACTED* in 2,000 years, yet completely disbelieving in the testimony of Joseph Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be a sad day. I wonder if Moses feels the same way looking at Ben-Gurion's Israel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1970/">1970</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
