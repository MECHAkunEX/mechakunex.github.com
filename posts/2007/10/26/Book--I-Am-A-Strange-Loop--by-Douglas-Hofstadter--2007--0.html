I enjoyed &lt;cite&gt;GEB&lt;/cite&gt; when I was young, but I anticipate a lot of that enjoyment came from my youth, rather from the superb quality of the book. This book, I imagine, will appeal to a similar crowd as &lt;cite&gt;GEB&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hofstadter, in my opinion, does not generally make arguments, but makes statements and reinforces them through repetition, rather than studied arguments. His standard strategy is &lt;em&gt;reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt;, but if you disagree with his steps, there is no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, he does not generally explain what he means very well. He has let the idea that all thoughts are "patterns" go too far and has given up ever explaining anything clearly: instead, he launches countless analogies at the reader and hopes they stick. This tells me that he doesn't know what he means, otherwise he should just say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are some really great parts of the book. Some of his analogies are very intriguing on their own grounds, whether you can tell what he means by them or not. (Such as Twinwirld, p. 214, and the Scanner on p. 301.) He also does a fantastic job explaining GÃ¶del's incompleteness proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that studying the brain is limited to the study of physical entities such as [...] would be like saying that literary criticism must focus on paper and bookbinding, ink and its chemistry, page sizes and margin width, ... [p. 26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central ideas in this book---in Hofstadter's brain in general---is that &lt;em&gt;strange loops&lt;/em&gt;---things that peer back at themselves, like audio/video feedback, particularly at a different level of abstraction, like "I"---are very important. At one point (p. 57) he remarks that it is not surprising that so many religions and groups are afraid of things that approximate them (like cameras, mirrors, and drawings) because such loops are odd things. I think it is very interesting that in an LDS temple sealing, we kneel on opposite sides of an altar and when we look beyond our partner we see an infinite corridor created by mirrors facing each other. Here, at one of the most important rituals of a "primitive" religion, is a very blatant example of his strange loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Hofstadter is a specimen of an extremely common and strange (in my opinion) person. He is a devout vegetarian, yet believes that abortion is okay. For him, he has a very detailed opinion of "soul"-ness that corresponds with "consciousness", but in his standard list he always puts even the most "abnormal" humans as above animals. Yet, he thinks it is wrong to kill animals--he spends a large portion of the closing chapters talking about the beauty of someone who wouldn't even kill an insect. Yet! He mentions multiple times how absurd it is to be opposed to murdering a new human.&lt;/p&gt;
