Snow, or ERS as I say. I think she is such an interesting woman and a great example from the pioneer period. I saw this book in the library and thought it would be a prudent thing to read more about her. These writings are (1) a biographical sketch she wrote for a book and (2) three diaries she kept: one from Nauvoo and two from the pioneer trek and the first few months in the Salt Lake Valley. They are bit lacking in terms of her identity and character, but they are interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From her sketch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing of her childhood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling that religion was necessary, I sought for it; but, when I asked, like one of old, "What shall I do to be saved?" and was told that I must have a change of heart, and, to obtain it, I must feel myself to be the worst of sinners, and acknowledge the justice of God in consigning me to everlasting torment, the common-sense with which God had endowed me, revolted, for I knew I had lived a virtuous and conscientious life, and no consideration could extort from me a confession so absurd. Some told me one thing and some another; but there was no Peter, "endowed from on high." [p. 9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, she moves to her baptism, which describes thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 5th of April, 1835, I was baptized by a "*REDACTED*" Elder, and in the evening of that day, I realized the baptism of the Spirit as sensibly as I did that of the water in the stream. I ad retired to bed, and as I was reflecting on the wonderful events transpiring around me, I felt an indescrible, tangable sensation, if I may so call it, commencing at my head and enveloping my person and passing off at my feet, producing inexpressible happiness. Immediately following, I saw a beautiful candle with an unusual long, bright blaze directly over my feet. I sought to know the interpretation, and received the following, "The lamp of intelligence shall be lighted over your path." I was satisfied. [p. 10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On plural marriage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From personal knowledge I bear my testimony that Plural Celestial marriage is a pure and holy principle, not only tending to individual purity and elevation of character, but also instrumental in producing a more perfect type of manhood mentally and physically, as well as in restoring human life to its former longevity. [p. 17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the martyrdom of Joseph Smith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene occurred in America. "The land of the free, and the home of the brave," to which our ancestors fled for religious freedom---where the "Dear old Flag" yet waves; and under which not one effort has been made by the authorities of either County, State, or General Government, to bring the perpetrators of that notorious murder to justice.  [p. 18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poem that Eliza wrote about leaving Nauvoo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go to the ends of the earth---&lt;br /&gt;
Let us go far way from the land of our birth;&lt;br /&gt;
For the Banner of Freedom no longer will wave&lt;br /&gt;
O'er the patriot's tomb---o'er the dust of the brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go from a country of strife---&lt;br /&gt;
From a land with oppression and cruelty rife---&lt;br /&gt;
From a country where justice no longer remains&lt;br /&gt;
From which virtue is fled, and iniquity reigns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go from a Government where&lt;br /&gt;
Our just rights of protection we never can share---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the soil we have purchased, we cannot enjoy,&lt;br /&gt;
Till the time when "the waster goes forth to destroy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go to the wilds for a home&lt;br /&gt;
Where the wolf and the roe and the buffalo roam---&lt;br /&gt;
Where beneath our own vines, we in peace, may enjoy&lt;br /&gt;
The fruits of our labors, with none to annoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go where our Rights are secure---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the waters are clear and the atmosphere pure---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the hand of oppression has never been felt---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the blood of the prophets has never been split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go where the Kingdom of God&lt;br /&gt;
Will be seen in its Order extending abroad---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the Priesthood of heaven, unopposed will go forth&lt;br /&gt;
In the regeneration of man and of earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go---let us go to the far western shore&lt;br /&gt;
Where the blood-thirsty "christians" will hunt us no more---&lt;br /&gt;
Where the waves of the ocean will echo the sound,&lt;br /&gt;
And the shout of salvation be heard the world 'round. [pp. 20--21]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poem to a couple getting married:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like two streams, whose gentle forces&lt;br /&gt;
Mingling, in one current blend---&lt;br /&gt;
Like two waves, whose onward courses&lt;br /&gt;
To the ocean's bosom tend---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like two rays that kiss each other&lt;br /&gt;
In the presence of the sun---&lt;br /&gt;
Like two drops that run together&lt;br /&gt;
And forever are but one,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your mutual vows be plighted---&lt;br /&gt;
May your hearts, no longer twain&lt;br /&gt;
And your spirits be united&lt;br /&gt;
In an everlasting chain. [p. 56]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza's graduation address (pp. 67--71) is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a student wrote to her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To My Teacher,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has now arrived when it falls to my lot to bid you farewell as a teacher; it is with feelings of regret that I do so. I would still wish to continue under the guidance of one who I feel is possess'd of every qualification necessary to instruct the useful mind in all the branches of useful knowledge. I am not insensible to the interest you have manifested in my behalf, but have witnessed it with pleasure, and my desire is, that I may have as great an interest for myself and endeavor as far as possible to profit from the instructions given me. Receive my heartfelt gratitude for every kindness bestowed upon me; and may the time not be far distant when I shall again sit under the sound of your voice and listen to all the good advice and every instruction which you may deem proper to give me. Excuse all imperfections and receive these lines as a token of that high regard which I feel for a kind and affectionate teacher. [p. 72]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts on the trail to the Salt Lake Valley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely happiness is not altogether the product of circumstances---our father who watches over his  children's welfare will order all things for good if we will put our trust in him, we need not fear. [May 18th, p. 133]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza mentions "[prayer] ... in the order of the Priesthood" [p. 136] outside the temple. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I breakfasted on antelope---quite a treat. [p. 183]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
