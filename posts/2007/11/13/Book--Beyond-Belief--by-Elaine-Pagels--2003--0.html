She deals with the question by examining the debates about and around the books we now call the Apocrypha and other lost and heretical writings---such as those found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls and at Nag Hammadi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Pagels highlights debate surrounding the Gospels of John and Thomas. She makes a very interesting case that John was written in direct opposition to Thomas' account. For example, she highlights that Thomas is chastised almost exclusively in John. (p. 58, p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting quotations of these writings in this book. I'd like to excerpt a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Didache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your money sweat in your hands until you know to whom you are giving. [p. 16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Martyr says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We baptize those" who not only accept Jesus' teaching but "undertake to be able to live accordingly." [p. 28]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irenaeus on relying on human experience to teach about divinity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have lied with no plausibility at all against God. For they ascribe the things that happen to human beings, and whatever they recognize themselves as experiencing, to the divine word. [p. 145]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagels writes that this is the beginning of the idea that God is "wholly Other."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irenaeus expressing his shock at the gnostic reading of Genesis and the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pretend that beyond God there is ... another Father---certainly they are not looking up to heavenly things, as they claim, but really descending into a profound abyss of insanity. [p. 167]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockqote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gender of the Hebrew term for spirit, &lt;em&gt;ruah&lt;/em&gt;, is feminine, which causes some to attribute femininity to the Holy Spirit. (p. 127)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irenaeus is primarily opposed to the division created in the church by the believers in the secret teachings: they separate believers into those who are "mature" and "immature." Pagels talks about how they would have a second baptism, or cleaning/anointing ritual, that would induct them into this state. After which, they would be taught more and have special secret meetings to discuss said doctrines. They believe then that baptism was just the first step of a multiple level process of connecting with God and fulfilling His commandments. In particular, Pagels says that such believers would graduate from seeing themselves as God's "servants" (or, "slaves") into seeing themselves as God's "children" (or, of the same material and heirs.) (pp. 136 -- 138)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
