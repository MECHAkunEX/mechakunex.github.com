&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Eve, the wife of noble Adam; it was I who violated Jesus in the past; it was I who robbed my children of heaven; it is I by right who should have been crucified. I had heaven at my command; evil the bad choice that shamed me; evil the punishment for my crime that has aged me; alas, my hand is not pure. It was I who plucked the apple; it went past the narrow of my gullet; as long as they live in daylight, women will not cease from folly on account of that. There would be no ice in any place; there would be no bright windy winter; there would be no hell, there would be no greed, there would be no terror but for me. [p. 3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various quotes of early Church fathers (Origen, Tertullian, etc.) make them look like backwards bigots. This is why I don't like to make a great deal out of when the early Church fathers agree with LDS theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following quote of Elizabeth Cady Stanton is included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the significant fact that we always hear of the "fall of man," not the fall of woman, showing that the consensus of human thought has been more unerring than masculine interpretation.
Reading this narrative carefully, it is amazing that any set of men ever claimed that the dogma of the inferiority of woman is here set forth.
The conduct of Eve from the beginning to the end is so superior to that of Adam. The command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge was given to the man alone before woman was formed. Genesis ii, 17.
Therefore the injunction was not brought to Eve with the impressive solemnity of a Divine Voice, but whispered to her by her husband and equal. 
It was a serpent supernaturally endower, a seraphim as Scott and other commentators have claimed, who talked with Eve, and whose words might reasonably seem superior to the second-hand story of her companion nor does the woman yield at once. 
She quotes the command not to eat of the fruit to which the serpent replies "Dying ye shall not die," v. 4 literal translation.
In other words telling her that if the mortal body does perish, the immortal part shall live forever, and offering as the reward of her act the attainment of Knowledge.
Then the woman fearless of death if she can gain wisdom takes of the fruit; and all this time Adam standing beside her interposes no word of objection. "Her husband with her" are the words of v. 6. Had he been the representative of the divinely appointed head in married life, he assuredly would have taken upon himself the burden of the discussion with the serpent, but no, he is silent in this crisis of their fate. Having had the command from God himself he interposes no word of warning or remonstrance, but takes the fruit from the hand of his wife without a protest. It takes six verses to describe the "fall " of woman, the fall of man is contemptuously dismissed ill a line and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent conduct of Adam was to the last degree dastardly.  When the awful time of reckoning comes, and the Jehovah God appears to demand why his command has been disobeycd, Adam endeavors to shield himself behind the gentle being he has declared to be so dear. "The woman thou gavest to be with me, she gave me and I did eat," he whines trying to shield himself at his wife's expense! Again we are amazed that upon such a story men have built up a theory of their superiority! [p. 10, but copied from an &lt;a href="http://www.thelizlibrary.org/undelete/library/library0041d.html"&gt;online source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very uplifting discussion of what is commonly rendered "help meet" on page 16. In summary, "When God makes ha-'adam into two beings, he creates woman, a power or strength equal to man." (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same section, the author writes about how "bone" and "flesh" are Hebraic poetic symbols for power and weakness; so, "bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh" is similar to "for better or for worse." (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the literalness of the Biblical account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer W. Kimball, as president of the church, stated that the rib story "of course is figurative." Brigham Young went so far as to call it a "baby" story. He also maintained, as did Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith, and others, that Adam and Eve's bodies were engendered and born by natural sexual functioning and that they were placed in Eden as adult beings. [p. 22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the "curses":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgments pronounced by the Lord were not curses but statements which symbolized the essential characteristics of mortality for all humanity. [p. 29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a great way of understanding "curses" we read about in the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next essay talks about women in the scriptures, but unfortunately starts with a completely absurd statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law [of circumcision] is addressed to males rather than people, freeing women from some religious obligations but denying them full participation in communal worship. For males, circumcision was a rite of initiation into the religious community. Because no comparable rite was available to women, even to initiate a girl into the society of women, women were forever outsiders. [p. 39]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am appalled that a woman would even imagine that female circumcision would be good women. It is barbaric, just like male circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this section the author constantly highlights scriptures that refer to "women and children" as evidence of female inferiority, neglecting that children are both male and female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Reference for myself: Junia the apostle on page 55.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mother in Heaven essay does a great job of pointing out very mainstream discussions of Her, such as by John Taylor, James E. Talmage and in the Deseret News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widening "theology" which is developing is more of a "folk," or at least speculative, theology than a systematic development by theologians or a set of definitive pronouncements from ecclesiastical leaders. For the moment, Mother in Heaven can be almost whatever an individual *REDACTED* envisions her to be. Perhaps ironically, we thus set her up, despite herself, to fill the most basic maternal role of all---that of meeting the deepest needs of her children, whatever they might be. [p. 74]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting story of tithing a newborn child for the building of the Nauvoo temple. (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On women and the temple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome sister Eliza and Zina as our Elect Lady and her counselor, and as Presidents of all the feminine portion of the human race, although compartively few recognize their right to this authority. Yet we know they have been set apart as leading Priestesses of this dispensation. As such we honor them. [p. 104, quoting Kanab Relief Society sisters]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilford Woodruff and wife blessing their son recorded on page 119.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blessing given before child-birth by women, to women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anoint your back, your spinal column that you might be strong and healthy no disease fasten upon it no accident belaff [befall] you, Your kidneys that they might be active and healthy and perform their proper functions, your bladder that it might be strong and protected from accident, your Hips that your system might relax and give way for the birth of your child, your sides that your liver, your lungs, and spleen that they might be strong and preform their proper functions, . . . your breasts that your milk may come freely and you need not be afflicted with sore nipples as many are, your heart that it might be comforted. [p. 130]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Priesthood and women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priesthood is to be used for the benefit of the entire human family, for the upbuilding of men, women, and children alike. There is indeed no privileged class or sex within the true Church of Christ; and in reality there can be no discrimination between the sexes as only human beings make it or permit it. Men have their work to do and their powers to exercise for the benefit of all the 
members of the Church regardless of sex or age. [p. 251, John A. Widtsoe]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Latter-day Saint women are asking why they are not entitled to hold the priesthood. To that I can say that only the Lord, through revelation, could alter that situation. He has not done so, so it is profitless for us to speculate and worry about it. [p. 267]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
