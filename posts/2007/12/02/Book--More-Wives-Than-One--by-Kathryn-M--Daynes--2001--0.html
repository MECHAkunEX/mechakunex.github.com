&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plural marriage thus promoted the goals of the church: it supplied all women who wanted to marry an opportunity to do so; it fostered a more equal distribution of wealth; and it provided aid to financially disadvantaged women by transferring economic resources from wealthier men. [p. 14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book reports that the August 17th, 1835 announcement from the Church mandating monogamy was voted on at a conference at which Joseph wasn't present. I knew about the announcement, but hadn't heard this. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the brief historical summary of the Nauvoo period, she writes about plural marriage as a means of solidifying the loyalty of the leaders, given that there was so much dissent for a time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealing also fostered loyalty in more complex ways [than dynasticism] because the act of accepting plural marriage was itself a dramatic sign of loyalty to the community's leaders. Entering plural marriage in Nauvoo caused considerable anguish, because it was secret and because it countered the monogamous tradition in the Western world and within the church in its earliest days. [quotes of Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Heber C. Kimball on their initial distaste follow.] [p. 26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tells a story of a bishop's daughter being requested as a wife to an Indian chief in the area as a way of increasing goodwill in early *REDACTED*. The daughter didn't like the idea, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cut the Gordian knot by asserting that she was married to George Peacock, her sister's husband. Chief Wahkara was deterred, but to indicate what Judge Peacock might expect, the chief plunged his knife into the pine table. When her father came from the fields, Lowry told him the whole story. Realizing the peril she and Peacock faced, he determined her word would be made good. He summoned Peacock and told him the news. He then found Isaac Morley---the only one in Manti who had the authority to seal plural marriages---and the couple quickly swore their marriage vows. To avoid the war chief's wrath, they hurried into hiding in Salt Lake City. Chief Wahkara died five months later; George and Mary Peacock's twenty-four-year marriage produced ten children. [p. 44]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another funny marriage story is on page 56.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern polygamists go against tradition in not allowing women greater ability to choose their husbands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saints grounded the logic of women's right to choose in the structure of polygamy itself. In plural marriage, men could choose a mate more than once, but each woman had only one husband. In her account of parents' courtship, Brigham Young's daughter wrote that women "ought to have their choice in the matter for they can choose but one; and they have a right to select that one." [p. 62]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the statistical section, she talks about how in other places, when the economy was bad there was less marriage, because young men could not get the resources to provide for women. In *REDACTED*, however, marriages were unaffected, because women would just marry older, more stable, men plurally. (p. 118) In this same section, she finds that more men were immigrants converts and most single immigrant females did not marry plurally: evidence against a common critical assumption. (p. 127)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole chapter was devoted to the ease of the divorce in *REDACTED* and the dynamics that created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*REDACTED*s instituted systems of divorce that were simple, non-legalistic, and participant-run. Although the church had mechanisms to try solving marital conflicts and to support established family units, it acknowledged that irreconcilable couples were better off apart. Divorced, each could then marry a compatible partner. If the couple merely separated without the right to remarry, probably neither would have had more children, which was one of the main purposes of marriage according to *REDACTED* doctrine. The primary purpose of *REDACTED* divorce was not to break up families but to encourage the remarriage of those who were already estranged from their spouses. [p. 142]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a brief discussion of courtship in plural marriage. The overview: it should be short and direct, and being long would be inappropriate.
