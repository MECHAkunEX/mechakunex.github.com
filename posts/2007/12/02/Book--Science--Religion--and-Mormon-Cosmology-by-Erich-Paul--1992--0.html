understanding of the structure of both a physical and
transcendent universe. In this science, both science and
religion have something to say about the shape and texture of
that cosmology. [p. 3]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[This] book presents the case that in theological,
religious, and historical terms *REDACTED*ism and science are
&lt;em&gt;fundamentally&lt;/em&gt; noncombative. [p.9]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He defends a view of *REDACTED*ism that was once summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pressing need of the age is a system of
religion that can recognize, at the same time, the truths of
demonstrated science and the doctrines found in the pages of
sacred writ, and can show that perfect harmony exists between
the works and words of the creator; a religion that will reach
both the head and the heart---that is will, satisfy both the
intellect and the conscience. [p. 27--28]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He promotes the idea that modern science is primarily dependent
on the tradition of Hermeticism. In this discussion, he mentions
this group believed metal grew in the Earth (p. 42). A favourite
quote of *REDACTED* critics is Brigham Young's statement to this
effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul argues that science is "not a body of answers. Rather,
science is a process, a way of asking questions." (p. 61) And
because of that, it is harder than most think to truly conflict
with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since many religious, philosophical, and historical
claims are not falsifiable, they are by this definition not
scientific either. Historically, however, there have been
countless scientific claims made that, at the time of their
discovery, also did not in fact accord with this
methodological imperative. For example, Copernican
heliocentrism, Darwinian evolution, mechanistic biology, [...]
made claims or held implied assumptions that at the time were
beyond the reach of the science of the day. [p. 64]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very central to the book is talk about *REDACTED* plurality of
worlds. In this discussion, he quotes Thomas Paine's attack on
Christianity that hinges on the assumption of countless worlds of
mortals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, the person who is irreverently called
the Son of God, and sometimes God himself, would have nothing
else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless
succession of deaths, with scarcely a momentary interval of
life. [p. 77]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cites an argument that Genesis is not about a realistic
description of the creation, but is an argument that God
&lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; all the categories of entities that other
societies worship; i.e., it is an argument for
monotheism. (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to myself: Citation of the origin of the 2.555 billion year
old age of the "world" in numerology and W. W. Phelps (contra:
Joseph Smith as some think.) (p. 183)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the section of extra-terrestial intelligence, he talks about
the von Neumann probe argument (p. 212.) I think this argument
neglects the possibility that humans are the probes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most important fundamental assumptions
for the doing of science is that science is
self-correcting. Only those conjectures that can, in
principle, be shown to be false are of genuine scientific
interest. If some sort of conjecture does not admit scientific
examination, then the canjecture cannot, be definition, admit
scrutiny. In a word, it is not falsifiable and is therefore
not science. For the SETI program to be a genuine
&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; program, and not simply a program of
&lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; faith, there must be a way to falsify its
theoretical claims. In other words, what kind of conjectures
would be sufficient, if shown to be false, to invalidate the
entire SETI effort? [p. 220]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of *REDACTED*ism's emphasis on a direct
correspondence between mind (the perceiver) and body (the
perceived), the temptation either to develop a natural theology or
minimally to confuse scientific findings with aspects of religion
becomes almost seductive. Although some *REDACTED* shave tied science
too closely to their religion, *REDACTED*ism in general never
committed the fatal error of developing a natural theology from
which it mights have been difficult to extricate itself. Within
*REDACTED*ism, although science has been described sometimes in
critical, though usually positive, terms, it has usually been
embraced enthusiastically. [p. 231]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;God create the earth, not for human indulgence and
consumption but for the salvation of his creation. Ultimately,
therefore, *REDACTED*ism's emphasis on its metaphysics and
eschatology, and not on that part of its epistemology that
encourages a realism, protects it from the arrogance of
secular humanism. [p. 233]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1992/">1992</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
