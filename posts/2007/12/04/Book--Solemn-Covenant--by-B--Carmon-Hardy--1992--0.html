&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This book] is a study of the rise and decline of an idea [plural marriage] and of those sturdy acolytes who tried to preserve it. [p. xix]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Taylor's speech in 1885:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph E. Robinson, though but a youth, related the dramatic effect the address had on him. As Robinson described it, guards were posted at the doors of the Tabernacle and only devout priesthood bearers were admitted. After recounting sufferings endured by the Saints, President Taylor turned to his two counselors and asked if they would stand by him. Both arose, moved to his side, and answered yes. He asked the Quorum of Apostles the same question. They arose and, with a single voice, said yes. He proceeded through all the leading priesthood quorums with the same result. Finally, he turned to the body of men in the Tabernacle and put the question to them. They rose to their feet and shouted yes. Taylor then declared that before losing wives, children, and possessions he would see their enemies damned in hell, "So help me, God." Robinson said it was the most dramatic moment of his life, that the Tabernacle thrilled and vibrated, and that chills ran through his body. Boy that he was, he said that he would have marched into the mouths of cannons had President Taylor asked it. [p. 51--52]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the lack of prostitution and adultery in *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Q. Cannon told the story of a *REDACTED* elder in Washington, D.C., who, when asked how many wives he had, replied, "I have such a plenty of my own that I have no occasion to trouble my neighbors." [p. 89]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absurdity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition demanding that [Apostle B. H.] Roberts be denied his seat in the national legislature produced 7,000,000 signatures. It was sent to Congress on twenty-eight rolls, each two feet in diameter and encased in an American flag. [...] It mattered not that many of the signatures were those of children or that some signed more than once; the petition had the hoped-for effect. [p. 249]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A funny anti-polygamy joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Stannard Baker, admiring the Saints in other regards, said *REDACTED* polygamy was so common that leaders in Salt Lake City could take a street car in any direction and arrive home. [p. 251]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1901 John Fiske lumped *REDACTED*s together with buffaloes and red Indians as those American spectacles best known to travelers from abroad. [p. 285]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After cataloguing the history of plural marriage in *REDACTED* and attacks thereon, a large portion of the book is devoted to a coverage of post-Manifesto activity. Based on the reading, I am firmly in support of the Church in all these actions. I believe that the Federal Government and others opposed to polygamy were in the wrong and the Church had every right to thwart them. Given that the Prophet and Brethren are where the revelatory status of the Manifesto comes from, these actions clearly demonstrate that, although the Manifesto is binding on us today, it was not necessarily binding in 1890.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief quote from the essay in the Appendix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inventive capacity of *REDACTED*s intent on entering polygamy by some means that would preserve a measure of ethical redemption is impressive. In addition to semantic usages such as &lt;em&gt;union&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sealing&lt;/em&gt;, thus permitting denials of plural &lt;em&gt;marriage&lt;/em&gt;, reference has also been made to instances involving the marrying of two wives on the same day; reliance on the fact that women were always sealed to men, allowing their husbands to deny that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; had married polygamously; use of proxies; marrying a new wife legally, after the death of a prior legal spouse, while maintaining relationships with earlier plurals; the performance of ceremonies at sea or in foreign countries; and resort to concubinage. The variety of ruses employed will never fully be numbered. Guy C. Wilson, Jr., remembered the case of a *REDACTED* couple intending a polygamous marriage; when asked by the magistrate if either had been married before, the groom answered "yes." "But," he added, "she's in the cemetery." His first was indeed in the local cemetery, standing up very much alive. [p. 377]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
