biography of God based solely on the Tanakh. The
assumption of the book is that as God acts in different
ways in the Bible, He is changing (i.e., having character
development) and the book asks: what changed and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write about (though I certainly do not
write against) the Lord God as the object of
religious belief. I do not attempt, as theology
does, to make an original statement about God as
an extra-literary reality. I do not write as a
historian and therefore do not focus, as
historians do, on the successive Israelite and
Jewish communities that believed in
God. [p. 10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading this book, it is important (and
difficult) to read it on its own terms, rather than
constantly thinking "This is wrong!" and referring to
the doctrine I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miles gives a number of questions he will ask and try
to answer in the text. I will quote them and paraphrase
the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did God create the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[God desired to know Himself and the only way
to do this was to create a "self-image" and
observe it.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, on flimsy grounds, did he destroy it [the
Flood] so soon after creating it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[God did not fully consider the ramifications
of His command to "multiple and replenish." When
He was surprised by the multiplication of the
species, He had to reconsider creation
itself.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, having for so long shown no interest
whatsoever in the wars of mankind, did he suddenly
become a warrior? [i.e., against Egypt]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[His promise to Abraham of increased fertility
was at risk when Pharaoh threatened the
Israelites.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, having attended slightly if at all to
morality, did he become a moralist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[After leading the Israelist into the wilderness,
He found Himself responsible for them.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his covenant with Israel seemed to break down,
what consequences loomed for him? What kind of life
awaited him after that impending breakup? How did he
adjust to his failure to keep the promises he made
through the prophets? What is his experienced life as
a being without parents, spouse or children?
[p. 22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting chapter in the book---to me---is the
chapter on Job. Another very intriguing part is when the
story of the Tanakh is retold in a polytheistic style,
with each "personality" of God being given a distinct
name. (p. 398)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very interesting thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion---Western religion in particular---may
be seen as literature that has succeeded beyond
any writer's wildest dreams. [p. 4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medieval mystic once wrote, "God cancels the
successiveness of men," meaning that while human
beings experience their lives one day at a time,
God sees their lives' time as a portrait on a
wall, every moment visible to him at once. But
human beings have returned the favor with a
vengeance, canceling the successiveness of the
protagonist of the Bible by a tradition of Bible
reading that regards the entirety of the text as
simultaneous to itself, so that any verse may be
read as the commentary on any other verse and any
statement true of God at one point is taken to be
true of God at all points. [p. 12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;		    
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before meeting him, everyone, absolutely everyone
has heard of him. Of whom else can that claim be made?
[p. 24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just inflicted labor in childbearing on her
and toil in the fields on him, why should he now spare
them the inconvenience of making their own clothing?
Why if not because, to speak very simply, he feels bad
about it all? [p. 36]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Genesis 24:6-7, when Abraham promises his servant
that he will find a wife for Isaac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, God has announced to Abraham what God
will do. Now, Abraham announces to God what God will
do. [p. 60]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caricaturing just a bit, this is to send the
secretary-general of the United Nations on a merely
personal errand. [p. 62]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the Abraham cycle, Abraham
belonged to the Lord; by the end of it, the Lord
belongs to Abraham, or at least he mysteriously acts
as if he does at certain points. [p. 64]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On God's identity and "God-ness":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no "adventures of God."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, up to a point, the inevitable result of
monotheism. Polytheistic Greek mythology includes some
stories that tell of intervention by Zeus in human
affairs but others that tell of Zeus's life among his
fellow gods. In the Bible, God, being the only god,
does not have that second kind of action through which
to present himself. But the peculiarity of God's
character does not end there. God could conceivably
engage in some kind of demonstrative action that would
serve his own self-presentation apart from any
interaction with man: miraculous displays, cosmic
disruptions, the creation of other worlds. But in fact
he refrains from all such activity. Not only does he
lack any social life among other gods but he also
lacks what we might call a private life. His only way
of pursuing an interest in himself is through
mankind. [p. 86]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He] is like a director whose actors never seem to
get it right and who is, as a result, often angry but
who doesn't, himself, always know beforehand what
getting it right will be. [p. 87]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever his character originated, it is difficult
to believe that it is the simple projection of a human
character. The human character whose projection it
would be can scarcely ever have existed. [p. 232]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biblical language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are moments when the Tanakh speaks a language
so strange it might have dropped from the moon, and
moments when a sentence will appear that might have
been overheard yesterday. [p. 105]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of monotheism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical monotheism is commonly named as ancient
Israel's signal contribution to Western
civilization. In an age of unbelief, however, just why
monotheism should be an advance on polytheism is not
immediately apparent. If the one God is no less a
fiction that the many gods were, wherein lies the
gain? [...] Are Hindus less ethical than monotheistic,
Bible-reading Jews and Christians?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] What counts is that, in one way or another,
moral value shall have been placed above the other
values that human beings properly recognize
[p. 110]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Leviticus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cannot be bored and terrified at
once. [p. 129]&lt;/p&gt;		
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book of Leviticus, the least dramatic, the lest
engaging book in the Bible, is also as a result of all
this, one of the gentlest. [p. 130]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On righteous punishment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curses section in chapter 28 [of Deuteronomy]
is four times as long as the blessings section and
rises to an eloquence in the depiction of horror
unmatched until Dante. [p. 145]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the writing of the Prophets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biographer of God, turning from the Pentateuch
and the Deuteronomistic History to the latter
prophets, may be compared with the biographer of a
general in some epochal, ancient war. Having relied on
the major surviving history of the war, in which he
general may be the central character but is far from
the only one, the biographer, by a great stroke of
luck, comes into possession of three large and twelve
smaller troves of the general's personal
correspondence---the fifteen books of
prophecy. [p. 196]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A view common to nearly all commentators on the
Book of Job is that, one way or another, the Lord has
reduced Job to virtual silence. Unnoticed is the fact
that from the end of the Book of Job to the end of the
Tanakh, God never speaks again. [p. 329]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capstone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western civilization is descended equally from
Athens and Jerusalem, and we routinely speak of both
kinds of tragedy. The midair incineration of the space
shuttle &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt;, the horrifying result of
a faulty O-ring, was a tragedy in the Greek
manner. [i.e., of situation] The torment of a man who
is determined to be both a tender father to his
children and a careerist athlete of the larger world
is a Jewish tragedy. [i.e., of character] The first
tragedy arises from without; the second arises from
within. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] God is the divided original whose divided
image we remain. [p. 408]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
