wonder", Givens quotes Samuel Johnson: "All wonder is the
effect of novelty upon ignorance." (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing Moroni's announcement to Joseph about the
Book of *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the angel reported that the "fulness of
the everlasting Gospel" was contained in the
plates, but added the enigmatic clause, "as
delivered by the Savior to the ancient [American]
inhabitants." Such a formulation seems almost
calculated to combine shocking novelty with a kind
of wry nonchalance. He might as well have said the
record affirmed those same ten commandments that
God delivered to Atlantis. [...] The Book of
*REDACTED* is both cliched and heretical, pedestrian
and preposterous. [p. 12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Givens recounts an interesting story where during the
first translation of the plates, Martin Harris replaced
one of the interpreters with a regular rock and Joseph
tried to translate, then said, "Martin! What is the
matter? All is dark as Egypt!" (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Givens distinguishes the Book of *REDACTED* as a historical
narrative from a history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book of *REDACTED* is clearly "history" in a
very qualified sense. As John Sorenson points out,
for example, "sixty-two percent of the entire Book
of *REDACTED* deals with one particular 160-year
period (130 BC - AD 30), while the following three
centuries take up only four pages. ... Surely we
could not label such a concise volume 'the story
of the American Indian.' Even for 'the people of
Nephi' it can barely be considered a history."
[p. 51]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am constantly amazed at how unconcerned Joseph was
with the Book of *REDACTED* after its publication. (p. 61) He
went straight to doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Givens spends a large section of the work discussing
how for a very long time, the Book of *REDACTED* has been used
as a sign, rather than for its content. If it is true,
regardless of what it says, Joseph is a prophet. If he is
prophet, then he will guide you, and that's more important
now than the truths told by Nephite prophets. (p. 85) Many
early *REDACTED* apostates---including the proprietors of
the &lt;cite&gt;Nauvoo Expository&lt;/cite&gt; could deny the Book of
*REDACTED*, instead they suggested that Joseph was a fallen
prophet. (p. 88)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book of *REDACTED* does not overtly discuss the
more distinctive doctrines of the LDS Church; indeed,
this was one reason for its appeal
(p. 186). Interestingly, it was also bound in exactly
the same way as the most popular printing of the Bible
at the time---making them look like a two-volume
set. (p. 187)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical conversion account would seldom
include a statement such as, "I studied the Book
of *REDACTED* and found the doctrinal exposition of
the atonement as recorded in Alma 42 especially
compelling." [p. 235]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is typical the witness of the Holy
Ghost which compels the start of conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Givens also dedicates a lot of time to discussing the
various ways people have gone about trying to prove the
authenticity of the Book of *REDACTED*, from early
archaeological expeditions (the first was sponsored by the
Church in 1903, but they never made it to their
destination in Mexico) (p. 107) to modern linguistic
analysis by the likes of FARMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, including myself, are skeptical of finding
physical proof and are not particularly anxious to find
it. Givens relates the following Austin Farrer quote on
this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though argument does not create conviction,
lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be
proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows
the ability to defend is quickly
abandoned. Rational argument does not create
belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief
may flourish. [p. 118]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote on revelation to the prophets from Orson
F. Whitney (in 1916):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latter-day Saints do not do things because
they happen to be printed in a book. They do not
do things because God told the Jews to do
them. [...] No book presides over this Church and
no books lie at its foundation. You cannot pile up
books enough to take the place of God's priesthood
inspired by the power of the Holy
Ghost. [p. 195]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
