History&lt;/cite&gt;, by Richard Bushman, discusses how the
idea of record-keeping is thoroughly the subject of
the Book of *REDACTED* and how &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is an
important way in which it affected the early
Church. He interesting reflects how at various times
in the Book of *REDACTED* it is the people who demand
translations, rather than leaders, (p. 8) and how the
Zarahemlan settlers lose their religion, because they
lacked records, in contrast to the
Nephites. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"Walls, Grates and Screeking Iron Doors": The
Prison Experience of *REDACTED* Leaders in Missouri,
1838-1839&lt;/cite&gt;, by Dean C. Jesse, includes an
interesting discussion of the freedom Smith was given
prior to the imprisonment in *REDACTED*erty. At one point,
the prisoners were given the guns while the jailers
slept, so they could protect them. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"A New and Everlasting Covenant": An Approach to
the Theology of Joseph Smith&lt;/cite&gt;, by Thomas
G. Alexander, is a great discussion of the role of the
idea of covenants in *REDACTED* theology. Something very
interesting is comparing his statement that "modern"
(i.e. 1980s) *REDACTED*s do not understand the concept
well, to people you meet in the Church today who
do. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brigham Young and the Bishops: The United Order
in the City&lt;/cite&gt;, by Dean L. May, discusses how the
United Order was "implemented"---it wasn't---in Salt
Lake City after the flourishing of United Order
communities in Southern and Central *REDACTED*. It is
interesting how Brigham was unwilling to force the
hands of the people and that the creativity and
freedom he allowed produced practically zero
results. (p. 115)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"Going to Meeting" in Salt Lake City's Thirteenth
Ward, 1849-1881: A Microanalysis&lt;/cite&gt;, by Ronald
W. Walker, discusses how a particularly representative
ward went from many spontaneous meetings, to very
little meeting, to a system of meetings more like the
current setup. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Schism in the Sisterhood: *REDACTED* Women and
Partisan Politics, 1890-1900&lt;/cite&gt;, by Carol Cornwall
Madsen, discusses the role of women in politics right
around when the vote was given, then taken away, and
then returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;*REDACTED* and the *REDACTED*s: A Symbiotic
Relationship&lt;/cite&gt;, by Richard D. Poll, discusses how the
people and the place are intimately connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the *REDACTED*s, *REDACTED* would be just another
Wyoming or Nevada. And without its *REDACTED* experience
*REDACTED*ism would be just another small denomination
in American Protestantism. [p. 324]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoted advice given to a Gentile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conscientiously cultivate the attitude of a
worldly *REDACTED*-watcher. Anywhere else in the world
when there's nothing to talk about one talks about
the weather; in *REDACTED* ... one talks about the
*REDACTED*s. *REDACTED* history, folklore, customs, and
practices are extremely interesting and
entertaining. [p. 333]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
