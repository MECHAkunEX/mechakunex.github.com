Roots of Modern *REDACTED*ism&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Mark P. Leone, is
a collection of tightly connected essays about various
aspects of *REDACTED* communities along the Little Colorado
river in Arizona from the late 1800s to the early
1900s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has an interesting collection of facts and an
intriguing analysis, but is ultimately off the mark. The
author is not just an outsider to *REDACTED*ism, but a clear
alien with little understanding of how *REDACTED*s actually
think. The author uses a Marxist dialectical analysis that
is strange at best and radically off-base at worst. His
obsession with communism is... thorough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that is not satisfying about the book is
the lack of a spiritual outlook on certain events. For
example, the author discusses how many dams were
constantly being blown out and rebuilt. At the time, the
people considered this the work of God and punishment. The
author mentions, however, that it was later realized by
federal experts rebuilding the dams, that it was necessary
for the silt to escape from behind the dam and if the dams
were &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; strong, the water would not be
productive. So, I interpret that as a beautiful instance
of the dams falling as a work of God, but not as a
punishment---instead, protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leone does have some interesting remarks and quips,
however. For example, after reprinting the transcript of a
Stake priesthood meeting where the priests were called to
rebuild a dam, he remarks: "This is how a system operates
that calls all members priests and all actions sacred."
(p. 104)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Leone's claims are very bold and unsupported; a
thought he spends a lot of time on is the
"memorylessness" of the *REDACTED*s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually this led to the dissolution of
*REDACTED*ism's historic critique of contemporary
society and to a population without an effective
collective memory. These results, when coupled
with *REDACTED*ism's attraction for ration-looking
decisions which are actually spur-of-the-moment
reactions, produced one of modern *REDACTED*ism's
chief traits: a rational population without a
memory. [p. 146-147]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very interesting part is hearing Leone describe what
a Sacrament meeting or Sunday School discussion is like
for an outsider. Priceless. (p. 189) And how *REDACTED*s could
not answer the question of "What makes a *REDACTED*?" more
than two statements that Joseph Smith was a prophet and
the Church is "true". (p. 191)&lt;/p&gt;
