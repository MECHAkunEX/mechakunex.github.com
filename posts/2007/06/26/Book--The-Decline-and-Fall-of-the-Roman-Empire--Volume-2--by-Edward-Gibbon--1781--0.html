&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The careless glance which men of wit and
learning condescended to cast on the Christian
revelation served only to confirm their hasty
opinion, and to persuade them that the principle,
which they might have revered, of the Divine
Unity, was defaced by the wild enthusiasm, and
annihilated by the airy speculations, of the new
sectaries. The author of a celebrated dialogue,
which has been attributed to Lucian, whilst he
affects to treat the mysterious subject of the
Trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt,
betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human
reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the
Divine perfections.(11) [p. 9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the new converts of Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new converts seemed to renounce their
family and country, that they might connect
themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a
peculiar society, which everywhere assumed a
different character from the rest of
mankind. Their gloomy and austere aspect, their
abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of
life, and their frequent predictions of impending
calamities, (16) inspired the Pagans with the
apprehension of some danger which would arise from
the new sect, the more alarming as it was the more
obscure. " Whatever," says Pliny, "may be the
principle of their conduct, their inflexible
obstinacy appeared deserving of punishment."(17)
[p. 11]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire of early Christians to become martyrs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of the Christians was too
remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient
philosophers, but they seem to have considered it
with much less admiration than
astonishment. Incapable of conceiving the motives
which sometimes transported the fortitude of
believers beyond the bounds of prudence or reason,
they treated such an eagerness to die as the
strange result of obstinate despair, of stupid
insensibility, or of superstitious frenzy.(95)
"Unhappy men !" exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus
to the Christians of Asia, "unhappy men! it you
are thus weary of your lives, is it so difficult
for you to find ropes and precipices?"(96) He was
extremely cautious (as it is observed by a learned
and pious historian) of punishing men who had
found no accusers but themselves, the imperial
laws not having made any provisions for so
unexpected a case; condemning therefore a few as a
warning to their brethren, he dismissed the
multitude with indignation and contempt.(97)
Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain, the
intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive
of more salutary effects on those which nature or
grace had disposed for the easy reception of
religious truth. On these melancholy occasions
there were many among the Gentiles who pitied, who
admired, and who were converted. The generous
enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to
the spectators, and the blood of martyrs,
according to a well-known observation, became the
seed of the church. [p. 41]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Constantine's move to the new capitol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many opulent senators of Rome and of the
eastern provinces were probably invited by
Constantine to adopt for their country the
fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own
residence. The invitations of a master are
scarcely to be distinguished from commands, and
the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and
cheerful obedience. [p. 97]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of the early understanding of
baptism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sacrament of baptism was supposed to
contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and
the soul, was instantly restored to its original
purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal
salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity
there were many who judged it imprudent to
precipitate a salutary rite which could not be
repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege
which could never be recovered. By the delay of
their baptism they could venture freely to indulge
their passions in the enjoyment of this world,
while they still retained in their own hands the
means of a sure and easy absolution.(68) [...] The
example and reputation of Constantine seemed to
countenance the delay of baptism. (70) Future
tyrants were encouraged to believe that the
innocent blood which they might shed in a long
reign would instantly be washed away in the waters
of regeneration; and the abuse of religion
dangerously undermined the foundations of moral
virtue. [p. 272-273]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relation between Constantius and Julian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of the letter [from Constantius] was
afterwards read, in which the emperor arraigned
the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had invested
with the honours of the purple; whom he had
educated with so much care and tenderness; whom he
had preserved in his infancy, when he was left a
helpless orphan. "An orphan!" interrupted Julian,
who justified his cause by indulging his passions,
"does the assassin of my family reproach me that I
was left an orphan? He urges me to revenge those
injuries which I have long studied to forget."
[p. 381]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Julian tolerated possible threats to his
authority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own
use a purple garment, and this indiscreet action,
which, under the reign of Constantius, would have
been considered as a capital offence, (68) was
reported to Julian by the officious importunity of
a private enemy. The monarch, after making some
inquiry into the rank and character of his rival,
despatched the informer with a present of a pair
of purple slippers, to complete the magnificence
of his Imperial habit. [p. 400]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian and the Law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the games of the Circus, he had,
imprudently or designedly, performed the
manumission of a slave in the presence of the
consul. The moment he was reminded that he had
trespassed on the jurisdiction of another
magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of
ten pounds of gold, and embraced this public
occasion of declaring to the world that he was
subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens, to
the laws, (75) and even to the forms, of the
republic. [p. 402]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian's character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generality of princes, if they were
stripped of their purple and cast naked into the
world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank
of society, without a hope of emerging from their
obscurity. But the personal merit of Julian was,
in some measure, independent of his
fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life, by
the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and
intense application, he would have obtained, or at
least he would have deserved, the highest honours
of his profession, and Julian might have raised
himself to the rank of minister or general of the
state in which he was born a private citizen. If
the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his
expectations; if he had prudently declined the
paths of greatness, the employment of the same
talents in studious solitude would have placed
beyond the reach of kings his present happiness
and his immortal fame. When we inspect with
minute, or perhaps malevolent, attention the
portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the
grace and perfection of the whole figure. His
genius was less powerful and sublime than that of
Caesar, nor did he possess the consummate prudence
of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan appear more
steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus
is more simple and consistent. Yet Julian
sustained adversity with firmness, and prosperity
with moderation. After an interval of one hundred
and twenty years from the death of Alexander
Severus, the Romans beheld an emperor who made no
distinction between his duties and his pleasures,
who laboured to relieve the distress and to revive
the spirit of his subjects, and who endeavoured
always to connect authority with merit, and
happiness with virtue. Even faction, and religious
faction, was constrained to acknowledge the
superiority of his genius in peace as well as in
war, and to con fess, with a sigh, that the
apostate Julian was a lover of his country, and
that he deserved the empire of the world.(85)
[p. 405-406]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "weakness" of polytheism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The weakness of polytheism was, in some
measure, excused by the moderation of its claims;
and the devotion of the Pagans was not
incompatible with the most licentious
scepticism.(12) Instead of an indivisible and
regular system, which occupies the whole extent of
the believing mind, the mythology of the Greeks
was composed of a thousand loose and flexible
parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty
to define the degree and measure of his religious
faith. The creed which Julian adopted for his own
use was of the largest dimensions; and, by a
strange contradiction, he disdained the salutary
yoke of the Gospel, whilst he made a voluntary
offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter
and Apollo. [p. 411]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "miracle" of the true cross:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The custody of the true cross, which on Easter
Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was
intrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem; and he alone
might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims
by the gift of small pieces, which they enchased
in gold or gems, and carried away in triumph to
their respective countries. But as this gainful
branch of commerce must soon have been
annihilated, it was found convenient to suppose
that the marvellous wood possessed a secret power
of vegetation, and that its substance, though
continually diminished, still remained entire and
unimpaired. (66) [p. 435]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a truly scathing account of St. George that
ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meritorious death of the archbishop
obliterated the memory of his life. The rival
of Athanasius was dear and sacred to the
Arians, and the seeming conversion of those
sectaries introduced his worship into the
bosom of the Catholic church.(123) The odious
stranger, disguising every circumstance of
time and place, assumed the mask of a martyr,
a saint, and a Christian hero;(124). and
worshipped as a saint and martyr and the
infamous George of Cappadocia has been
transformed(125) into the renowned St. George
of England, the patron of arms, of chivalry,
and of the garter.(126) [p. 453]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a discussion of the natives of Scotland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in the neighbourhood of the commercial and
literary town of Glasgow a race of cannibals has
really existed, we may contemplate in the period
of the Scottish history the opposite extremes of
savage and civilised life. Such reflections tend
to enlarge the circle of our ideas, and to
encourage the pleasing hope that New Zealand may
produce in some future age the Hume of the
Southern Hemisphere. [p. 567]&lt;/p&gt;
