Book of *REDACTED* that has been discovered since the time of
Joseph Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outrageous daring of its title page is the
very thing that should whet the appetite of a real
scholar: here is a book that is asking for a
fight, so to speak, and if it is as flimsy as it
looks at first glance any competent schoolman
should have little trouble polishing it off in an
hour or so. [p. xii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We] are not going to prove anything in this
book. The evidence that will prove or disprove the
Book of *REDACTED* does not exist. [p. xiv]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley talks about how the innovative thing about the
Bible and the Book of *REDACTED* is its concern for
historical, rather than mythological, story-telling. He
quotes Eduard Meyer: "This respect for fact and historical
perspective in the records of the race finds no parallel
in the whole literature of the ancient Near East until the
time of Herodotus." (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley references how the thought that Lehi's family
would try to build a temple in the New World was
considered unthinkable for a real Jew. He cites the story
of exiled Jews who lived near the base of the Nile who got
permission from Jerusalem to build another temple!
(p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley quotes Stendahl on Marcion who wished
Christianity to be "new": "Our pattern of thought is that
of natural science: Jesus is the inventor of Christianity
and the church is the guardian of his patent and
copyright. In the New Testament the major concern is the
diametrically opposite one: to make clear that all is
'old.' in accordance with the expectations of the
prophets." (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reference is made to "Origen's argument for the
roundness of the earth was that the first Christians
taught that God had covenant people on the other side of
the world---the Antichthonians." (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athanasius: "One must not recite the mysteries to the
uninitiated, lest outsiders who do not understand them
make fun of them while they perplex and scandalize
investigators." (p. 105)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley spends some time describing how many scholars
believe the text of Isaiah has evolved over time. He then
shows how the parts that Nephi quotes are from the
chapters that are regarded as the original and
oldest. (p. 125)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the neglect of the writing of the ancients in the
study of the ancients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as if one were to try to reconstruct the
life of Lord Chesterfield by the careful
examination of his bones, his clothes, the house
he lived in, the food he ate, etc.---all of which
are important---while throwing aside the man's
daily journal, which tells us in his own
handwriting where he was, what he saw and heard
and did, and even what he thought and felt. This
should be at least as instructive as the
measurement of his bones. [p. 145]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A description of how "And it came to pass..." is an
Egyptian grammatical form is on page 150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter "Good People and Bad People" is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One did not have to be a Nephite or a Lamanite,
however, in order to be wicked or righteous: every
man and woman who ever lived has been capable of
doing right and wrong no matter when or where he
or she lived. [p. 349]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"One can never prove the Book of *REDACTED* to
another, but one can go far enough to ask for a testimony
for one's self, and get it." (p. 406)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1967/">1967</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
