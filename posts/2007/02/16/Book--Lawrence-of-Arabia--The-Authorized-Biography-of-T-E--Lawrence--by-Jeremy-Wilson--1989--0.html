book to learn about him from. However, it can be a little
bit slow, due to the insistence on covering
everything &lt;em&gt;that happened&lt;/em&gt;, rather than only the
really intriguing parts. Even so, his whole life is really
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, Wilson reflects how the over-hype about
Lawrence has led to him to be seen as rather
inconsequential. One of his goals is to show how
Lawrence played a very large role in the Arab Revolt,
but was not the super-hero he is made out to
be. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill wrote the following about
Lawrence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world looks with some awe upon a man who
appears unconcernedly indifferent to home, money,
comfort, rank, or even power and fame. The world
feels not without a certain apprehension, that
here is some one outside its jurisdiction; some
one before whom its allurements may be spread in
vain; some one strangely enfranchised, untamed,
untrammelled by convention, moving independently
of the ordinary currents of human
action. [p. 4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He refers to the fact that Lawrence never used his
fame after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person, whom Lawrence met in Egypt wrote: "[He
was] an odd gnome, half cad --- with a touch of genius."
(p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Buxton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'His influence is astounding not only on the
misbeguided native, but also I think on his brother
officers and seniors. Our here he lives entirely with
the Arab, wears their clothes, eats only their food,
and bears all the burdens that the lowliest of them
does. He always travels in spotless white, and in fact
reminds one of a Prince of Mecca more than
anything. [p. 534]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence was at Oxford, he toured Europe visiting
castles. He wrote home to his parents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It] does not make the least difference in
style, since all my letters are equally bare of
personal information. The buildings I try to
describe will last longer than we will, so it is
only fitting that they should have the greater
space. [p. 35]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is ironic that he has become so famous
and will be so renowned for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this trip, he visited Syria for the same
purpose. He asked advice for someone who had been and
they suggested he hire a guide and a camel. He said he
would walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Europeans don't walk in Syria," said Hogarth,
"it isn't safe or pleasant." "Well, I do", said
Lawrence. [p. 53]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence was later traveling the Wilderness of
Zin, his companion Wolley remarked, "It speaks wonders
for the Children of Israel that they left Moses alive
after he brought them to a place like that."
(p. 140)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawrence briefly returned to London at the start of the
war. He wrote, "I disapprove of London on eighteen
counts... London seems curiously unmoved." (p. 152)
Lawrence was so busy when he was at the War Office that he
sarcastically wrote, "I'm sure somebody will ask the
W.O. for an epic poem on Sinai about next Friday."
(p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great description of Lawrence's strategy with
the Arabs around page 314.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawrence felt terrible about having to tell the Arabs that
their liberty was guaranteed throughout the war. Wilson
remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the remainder of the war he would often
choose to place himself in extreme danger. He was
wounded several times, and on many occasions was lucky
to survive where others, close to him, were
killed. [p. 414]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war, Lawrence was offered a Knighthood, which he
rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He [...] recalled that he had told the King: "your
Cabinet are an awful set of crooks". The King, rather
taken aback, had countered: "Surely you wouldn't call
Lord Robert Cecil a crook?" It seems that Lawrence
agreed to this single exception. [p. 578]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Feisal (the main Arab) visited England. He gave some
lectures, which Lawrence interpreted. In one instance, Feisal
recited the Koran, and Lawrence made an impromptu
speech. (p. 593)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence decided to work with the Arabs more: "I
decided to go my own way, with or without orders."
(p. 398)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence was approached by Muslim Turkish troops,
who turned out to be fake: "There are no gods but God, and
Jesus is his prophet." (p. 510)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I liked a particular Arab very much, and I thought
that freedom for the race would be an acceptable present."
(p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;
