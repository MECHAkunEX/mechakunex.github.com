Before the Xbox 360 had come out, I heard about this game and was
very interested because of the star power of Sakaguchi. I remember
in 2007 going to my brother-in-law's house and playing a demo of
it. The demo was not very good, because all the characters had all
possible powers and it was very opaque because you did nothing to
earn them and had no context for the story. This, by the way,
taught me that RPG demos are generally to be avoided.

But, I never bought the game until this January---almost 5 years
after it came out in North America and 6 after it came out in
Japan.

Part of me had lost hope in the game, because I've grown much more
interested in more challenging action-based games than games that
are about wars of attrition (see my posts on FF13, for example.)
This game sounded incredible Dragon-Quest-y and not even very
Final-Fantasy-y. But another part of me wanted to play it.

I have a bit of a commitment to play games in the order they came
out, so I took this off my queue.

I was very happy when the game offered me the voice track in
Japanese. And then it took about two minutes for the game to
scream, "Anime!" It's a very Anime-esque game. Visually, but more
importantly story/sensibility-wise.

In a time when lots of games, particularly Final Fantasy, are
trying to be so serious, this game returns to the basics of kids
going on an adventure without real thought to the
consequences. Pretty much instantaneously they meet what I presume
will be the Big Bad and are smacked down, but then get their
powers a la l'Cie. Then they escape.

Something strange about this set up is that the player feels like
they know what the plot and motivation will be, but the characters
don't really give any indication that they have a larger
motivation than "Get Home". I presume they'll arrive to a
destroyed village which will inspire them to get revenge or
something?

The battle system is very traditional. There's no active elements
at all. There is some strategy to back-row/front-row and planning
attacks to take out enemies before they can take an action, but so
far it is pretty mild. The most challenging decision is how much
you will charge a spell. More charge equals more time to cast,
which is risky because you can't act and you really want to
destroy enemies fast, so if you over-charge, then you'll waste
time. Additionally, if you charge past another of your characters,
you don't want that character to poach. There appears to be an
indicator on the charge bar for when the enemy will be killed, but
it isn't really explained.

I am worried that I will grow tired of the combat system too
quickly.

Outside of combat there are two other systems of importance. The
first is the attack field and multi-monster attack system. As you
walk around, enemies appear randomly, but you can see them and
attack them based on your choice. You can press a button and
attack all enemy units in range, rather than one-on-one. There is
a disadvantage to this, because you don't get to heal in between,
and status effects persist, but there is also an advantage: a
random buff from a roulette wheel. I have not yet had reason to do
anything but always go for the biggest attack radius.

The other system is the job system (called the Shadow Class.) I
have not yet gone outside of the default jobs for the three
characters I have. But, I am worried that it will be too
overwhelming. That's a common complaint I have with job systems
like this. So far there's isn't a good indicator of how many
levels of your current job it will take to get One More Skill, and
that would temper my fear because I could plan better.

The game is definitely designed around the attrition system, but I
haven't really been impacted by it yet. I find HP and MP to be
plentiful. Right now my scarce resource is Antidotes. The main
character has been poisoned for a long time, but I can't heal him
over it and I'm nervous it will be Game Over (i.e. reload) if he
dies, so I'm spending a lot of MP healing him normally after every
so many steps.

I find the story and the world to be charming. There have already
been some funny, memorable moments. For example, the main
character keeps saying that he won't give up and miraculous things
happen, which he attributes to his stubbornness. Also, enemies
drop treasure in the form of little "Poo Piles" that say "(squish)
(squish)" when you search them. Nice!
