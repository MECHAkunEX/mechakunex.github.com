happened in the last book as a reminder.

The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It's as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn't possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.

I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.

I teared up in the District 11 scene.

Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?

It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.

Haymitch's story is great.

The amount of "food porn" in the books never gets old, strangely.

Katniss' private session with the Gamemakers :)

The pre-Games interviews were amazing.

The end of Part II is waaaay intense.

I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss' body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she'll say she's "naked" or talk about
her "breasts" and most often she mentions her "underwear",
"underclothes", or "undergarment". It's particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we're so often given.

The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2009/">2009</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
