to be able to spend it without worrying too much about what I am
saving for, etc. I decided to order a game on Amazon and then
download one to play right away. I'd heard an interview about
this game and it sounded very cute.

I played for two chunks of an hour and a half. Right away the
writing was hilarious and made me want to read every little thing
and look at the text on all the monsters.

When I started playing, I like the 16-bit art-style the game has
and the mechanics are pretty nice. The movement feels a bit
sloppy with the Xbox's analog stick, though.

The game is incredibly streamlined, despite its style. I was very
surprised with the graph-based overworld rather than a map that
you actually walk around on. It makes the linearity of the story
very much in your face. Now, that linearity is not terrible, given
how much I liked games like Final Fantasy that just have the
illusion of options. But, in this there really can't be any
options because no paths can be hidden from you. It's a bit
underwhelming, even though it is nice to not have to walk.

The lack of random battles was surprising as well and it appears
that there are simply a fixed number of battles in the game,
because when you leave an area then go back, all the enemies you
defeated are still gone. It's kind of surprising and it makes me
nervous as a grinding/completion-ist oriented person.

The battle system itself is pretty neat. The idea that you store
up MP per round and then unleash it all at once places something
that it is a fairly common, but rarely used, mechanic in other
games (like Tension in Dragon Quest or Cyan's Special Attack in
FF6) as the defining thing. At least you don't give up your turn
and can still attack or use a 0 MP spell. Nevertheless, I almost
always use 1 or 2 MP spells.

Similarly, the item system is really odd. Items are like the
skills in FF13: they can only effectively be used a finite number
of times per battle. But, they can be used every battle without
effort and they are improved via a technology-research-like
system. It's odd.

I like the way the battle order is resolved... how you have to
decide your moves slightly in advance of what other characters
will do. It's just enough active to be interesting.

I think it is odd that you always know how much HP the enemies
have. It seems wrong to have so much information.

As interesting as the system is, I've never lost a battle or felt
very worried about any particular outcome. The battles are
definitely interesting, but I can generally ace them. I hope they
stretch me a bit more eventually.

Given how quickly you lose a party member, it makes me extremely
nervous about giving resources (particularly buying weapons for)
the non-main characters. I wish they would telegraph a little
more that a character will be permanent. (I've decided that if
they have all four weapon upgrades, they must be.)

The class system is very funny, but I haven't found a lot of use
for the various classes. There are few that I find myself really
using---like healing ones, but generally I ignore them except to
level them evenly. I think it is funny that Tycho can be a
Gentleman AND a Scholar.

I quite like the game and will continue playing it, of course.
