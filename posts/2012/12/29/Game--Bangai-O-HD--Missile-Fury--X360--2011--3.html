It was
interesting because it had three phases and each needed a bit of
finesse to solve. In the first phase, you had to Dash into enemies
to make them vulnerable, but it was okay deal with them all
together. In the second, you had to try to focus on one enemy but
make sure you blew up their missiles before they got to you. In
the final one, you had to Dash into things to make the vulnerable
and then use a focused Counter. The last phase was the hardest to
do.

In the afternoon, I played again for a little more than an hour. I
did two stages.

Stage 21 --- This was interesting, because it was very easy in the
beginning, but very difficult right at the end. Stages like that
are kind of annoying, because the amount of time you need to spend
to repeat the part you are good at is so long. But it was
interesting to learn the skill of freezing tons of bullets.

Stage 22 --- This one took the majority of the time. I really like
these long levels that aren't as puzzle-y and require you to do a
lot of stuff pretty fast. It took me a long time to be able to
reliably get the end and even longer to defeat the final
enemy. Even though I got a very good score and time, my time would
have been a lot better, because I accidentally missed a single
enemy in the first room and had to go back. I think tonight I will
go back and beat it faster.

----

In the evening, I played for about three hours.

Stage 22 --- I did this stage again to improve my time and it took
two tries, but I ended up with #24 in ze world!

Stage 23 --- This was a really weird level that took me quite a
bit to get the hang over. I eventually started spamming Counters
at the top and bottom to eliminate the targets up there, then
carefully destroy the giant enemies one by one afterwards.

Stage 24 --- This was a super challenging one because there were
so few capabilities. I took it extremely slowly and just bounced
the enemies back towards the end and progressed from there.

Stage 25 --- This was a baffling level to start. These really
puzzle-ly levels are hard to grasp. Eventually I got the hang of
it and felt forced to go really fast. It turns out that the
pressure made become #5 in ze world (for time) on this level! Nice

Stage 26 --- This was a crazy, beautiful level. I love the irony
in the hint. I used the standard Dash-Counter-Dash-Counter-repeat
technique. It is exhilarating to do levels like this... the
explosions are so satisfying.

Stage 27 --- This was really interesting. They are getting super
creative with the chained bombs. It took me a long time to master
the final way of enemies that launched the Napalm bombs. The
beginning was tough too... but the cycle is so fast, I got used to
it quickly.

Stage 28 --- This was challenging. There are a lot of one-hit kill
enemies that really got under me. The worst thing happened during
this... the first time I got to the end, I wasn't able to make it
to the final target before it was sealed off, so I had to do it
again, and of course didn't do it perfectly again for a bit. :(

Stage 29 --- Hah! This stealth missions was brilliant. After
getting to the end, it was so satisfying to smash through
everything. I watched the video of the top time person and their
technique is absurd.

Stage 30 --- I initially found this one almost impossible. It's
fitting that it is the stage with the least number of completions
on the leaderboards out of the ones I've done. After getting a
time of almost 2'45", I decided to watch a master and see what the
time technique was. The #1 beat it in 0'13". I had to try their
technique. Over the next hour or so, I gradually improved. My
first big leap was to 1'40", then I got to 1'20", then 0'40", then
finally to 0'20". It was beautiful. I got #7 in the world for
time! Nice!

Stage 31 --- This was a super challenging level and ridiculously
over-the-top in the explosions department. In my winning run, I
destroy the top before the bottom by delaying the lighting of the
fuses. It seemed like a good idea and only lost a bit of time by
having to go back to the far right to kill some enemies I missed.

I can't believe how good this game is. Seriously.
