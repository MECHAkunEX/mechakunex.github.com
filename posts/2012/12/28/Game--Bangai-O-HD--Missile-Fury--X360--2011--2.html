I spent about ten minutes
on stage 8---where there's just a single big Ant and then a ton
more spawn. It was very reminiscent of the first level, where you
have to get the counter attack timing just right. Eventually I
realized I needed to move around to stay a head of the enemies,
then it wasn't hard.

Stage 9, I still haven't beat. It's very difficult because it's
so long and I seem to run out of resources very quickly. It feels
like you can't really dodge in this game, so you need to use
other things to avoid taking damage---bursting at the right time,
countering at the right time, pointing your shots at the enemy's,
etc. I was able to get to about 75% through, with close to full
health, but I think I needed a counter and didn't have one.

I don't like the idea of skipping ahead to other levels (even
though it lets you), because I'm worried that I'll forget which
levels I did and didn't do. (I guess I could just keep track of
that here.)

-----

Later in the day, I played for 35 minutes and beat Stage 9. It
was really intense, but I learned to properly harness my moments
of invulnerability effectively enough to do it. In my
second-to-last run, I forgot the two targets in the massive
swarms of robots, but had gone past the point of no return, so I
couldn't go back and get them. In my winning run, there were a
few moments where one more hit would've killed me. This game is
so exhausting.

-----

In the evening, after my kids were asleep, I played for another
2:20. I got to Stage 20.

Stage 10 --- Very confusing. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to
do, but after running down the clock, I decided I was supposed to
wait for something. Once I did that it got too furious and I did
a massive counter and won. I guess you are supposed to kill them
all at once?

Stage 11 --- This was a fun, long level. I think it was the first
that took away Dash attacks... which is recurring thing in the
game. I found it difficult until I realized I should use more
Counters.

Stage 12 --- This was a really short level that didn't take very
long to do, but it was very enjoyable. I like the idea of a
falling trap and I was able to use a single massive counter to
get almost everything.

Stage 13 --- This was the first soccer ball map. It's insane and
I loved it. It took me just a few tries.

Stage 14 --- This one was really, really hard. It seemed really
easy at first, but then I'd die out of nowhere. I realized that it
was the Ninjas I was warned about in the hint. Once I knew that
they were there, it was clear the key was to never be
vulnerable. I went back and forth between Dash-ing and
Counter-ing, until all the Ninjas were destroyed. Then, I just
needed to corral the other enemies against the corners to blast
'em. Sweet.

Stage 15 --- This was tough. It took me maybe ten tries before I
was able to get past the first Target. Then, it was tough to get
to the next one. I decided to Dash burst the majority of the way,
then hang out where it was safe and clear a path through the
turrets. I cleared the rest of the level after that realization.

Stage 16 --- This was a super tough level. The hint is like the
one from 14... it sounds obvious and ridiculous, but it's the key
to winning. I nudged myself into the corners and got them before
going out. Intense.

Stage 17 --- This one was infuriating. After about maybe 15
minutes, I got to the end but realized I had forgotten to blow
the trail of bombs to get past. The next time I got to the end, I
had forgotten to kill one enemy, so I couldn't get through. The
next time, I didn't have much time, so it was hopeless to
discover what I was supposed to do against the boss. The next
time, I tried to use a concentrated Bounce Counter (in fact, ten
in a row), but they weren't enough to hurt the target. (I thought
I should use the Bounce because in my brief time before, I
couldn't aim a Homing shot in.) Then, I watched a video and the
person just used a Concentrated Homing shot. I did that and
one. It was super frustrating because the level is so long and I
just needed to vary what happened at the end. In addition, I had
a few failures into each one.

Stage 18 --- This was a very challenging level. The lack of Dash
seemed like a real killer because there's just so much stuff going
on, but once I got a grove in, I was able to go forward for just
the right amount of time and Counter all the way to the end.

Stage 19 --- This was a pretty challenging level. There were many
of the hardest kinds of enemies. The first time I got to the end
(i.e. the middle), the big blue guy in the middle killed me
because I tried a Bounce Counter. Next time I got him with the
Napalm, but I had forgotten one Target and had to go back. By the
time I got back to the middle, I had only 30 seconds. It took me a
few more times to get back to the middle again, and then I used
Dash and the concentrated Bounce Counter to get to the end. A very
satisfying level.

-----

This game is so amazing. It's so tough but so satisfying to beat
every level. Every level feels so different and like it's almost a
different game. Amazing.
