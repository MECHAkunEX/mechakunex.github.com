He
loves Mega Man a lot and always wants to play one. He's very
interested in fighting Skull Man, but I went Toad -&gt; Bright -&gt;
Pharaoh and then died during Ring Man's stage.

Something I dislike about Mega Man is the three lives system. On
a single level, it is a good idea, because it requires you to get
some mastery, rather than just sacrificing life to go
forward. The problem is that when you beat a boss on your last
life, the next level you start off with only the one life. This
encourages you to commit suicide at the start of the next level
(because there's no disadvantage to doing that... you keep your E
Tanks and all your equipment.) I don't like it when games have an
optimal strategy that is (a) un-fun, (b) trivial to execute, and
(c) trivial to have just programmed out of the game.

In any case, this game has lots of clever concepts in its
platforming.

In Toad Man's stage, the rain's ability to push you is very
challenging and the rushing water is also interesting. Fighting
the Giant Snail on the water-ridden platform was very nerve
racking.

In Bright Man's stage, the jumping grasshoppers were cool
(although really out of place) and the enemies that shut-out the
lights when you hit them was pretty crazy. The sequence before the
boss door where you had to jump from falling/sliding platform to
the next one while the light-putter-outers where moving around and
firing. It was nuts.

In Pharaoh Man's stage, the platforms then when you jump on them
start moving and then fall was cool. It was particularly
challenging because the next platform would shot at you just
before you were supposed to jump on to it and if you didn't jump
early enough, you would be shocked and fall to your death.

In Ring Man's stage (what I've seen so far), I like the platforms
that shift from side to side as you walk across them. In one
sequence if you dropped beneath one you could get a large health
charge, but you had to jump back up quickly or else you'd be
stuck. It's a great idea.

This game is a very creative Mega Man game that really does
something quite different every stage, rather than executing the
same set of mechanics really well. (It's not that I think the
normal Mega Man style is bad, but this is neat.) I've heard a lot
of griping about the charged shot, but I don't find it to be so
powerful that I have to keep it charged all the time (and thus
slow down the action.) Whenever I've done that, I think it has
hurt me more than it helped.
