First, I did
the tutorial then stages 1, 2, and 3. Later in the day, I did
stages 4, 5, 6, and 7.

I've tried to play a Bangai-O game before (the DS one), but I
didn't give it enough of a chance to convince me (so I don't have
a reasonable opinion of it); but, in any case, I was a bit nervous
about this. Given that I spent some money on though, I figured it
would be a nice way to force me to understand it... given that
I've heard so many good things about the Bangai games before, and
I love Treasure.

This game is insanely overwhelming, visually and
mechanically. There's a 29-page in-game manual, which frightened
me away from reading it. Then in front of each of level is an
overwhelming set of advice, which I haven't yet been able to
understand deeply enough to apply.

The first few levels were very fun and challenging. The next set
escalated the difficulty a lot---particularly the level where you
fought Longai-O and the Ant level.

When I play the game, I immediately feel a sense of time dilation,
where everything seems to be going really slow and I can focus on
little things on a purely intuitive basis. Even though a level may
only last two minutes, it feels like it lasts a lot longer because
of the number of decisions I'm making. Yet, at the same time, I
feel like I'm not really making conscious choices, but am just
reacting at a reptilian level to what's going on. It's bizarre.

I tried to explain the game to my wife a bit, who was overwhelmed
as I expected, but she was able to appreciate my replay of the Ant
level. Moreover, she was able to immediately see the amazing skill
of the number one in world (for time) on that same level.

I get the feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun with this game!
