It
discussed how in the 1820s, a ballet master named Vestris
dramatically changed the art.

He took the old three different genres of ballet and combined all
their steps into a new genre---that is modern ballet. This had lots
of big consequences. The old notation systems didn't work any
longer and weren't replaced because of the complexity of the new
dances.

The old style of practice was forgotten and replaced. Before, whole
dances were done continuously for practice, but after individual
steps were repeated dozens of times before going on to more
steps. The various steps were ranked in order of difficulty. For
example, in Vestris' notes it says there were 27 different kinds
of pirouettes. 

In particular, the role of the male dancer changed a lot. Vestris
innovated the male dancer as acrobat doing many jumps and
turns. This was seen as very wild and distasteful. In addition,
the new style he came up with was perfected by women, so part of
his innovation led to male dancers becoming pariahs and not a
major part of ballet. In fact, in the mid 1800s, many male roles
were played by women! This is funny to me because a hundred years
before, the opposite was true.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2010/">2010</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
