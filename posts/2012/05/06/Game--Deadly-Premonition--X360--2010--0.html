podcasts, particularly the "WARNING: A Huge Podcast"
special. Before playing it, I'm slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won't want to. (I don't want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don't bother me because there's just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn't finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I'm
giving it a chance, but if it doesn't take me in one night, I
don't think I'll keep playing it.

I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn't hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it's all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.

The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the "gas stand" is.)

The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don't really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it's disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it's also not very effective. There's not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.

The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.

It's a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don't
think I'll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I'm slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I'll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I'll give it more time.
