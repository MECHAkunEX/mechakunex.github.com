I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn't load my Clear data, so I'm
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.

It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war... especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!

The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the "stealth" missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you'd make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)

I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don't think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I've got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it's mainly the story pushing me to do more.

It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren't counted
in the real total. Wow!

I highly recommend this game.
