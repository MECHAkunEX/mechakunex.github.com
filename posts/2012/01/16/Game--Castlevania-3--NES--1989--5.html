Famicom. I knew that it did not work on my PowerPak and I had
heard that due to its special chip the game was much much better
in the Japanese version. I got it very cheap too, so it was a nice
buy.

This is a great game. I find it much much more playable than the
other two NES Castlevania games. It is still quite clunky, but not
terribly obtuse compared to those games. I gave it a
play-through.

The first night I got the first level with a great deal of
frustration as I got used to the controls. The next night I went
through the clock tower and got Grant "DaNasty". The next night I
escaped from the clock tower, went through the next level, and
went through the pirate ship. The day I went through 4 and 5 and
then at night I went through 6, 7, and I got to the end of 8.

I played through stage 8 so many times I could get through it
perfectly without getting hit at all---up until the boss that
is. I could beat the first form of Death about a fifth of the
time, but I wasn't able to beat the second form. I probably fought
him about 30 or 40 times that night with no luck. So I decided to
use a password and skip to the next level.

However, in the next level I could barely even make it to the
second block. It got to the point where the screen is just
swarming with enemies that slowly suck your life away... and you
need to make it through 3 blocks and then fight
bosses. Insanity. It's too much for me and it's not rewarding
enough.

I do like the game and I will definitely play parts of it again,
but it got to an insane point that wasn't fun... just unfair.
