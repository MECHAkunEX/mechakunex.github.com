I finished the Wharf then went
totally through the Lost Bastille. The Bastille was really tough
because of the little zombie/mummy things with their super
powerful jumping attack. I went through the Lost Sinner next,
which was also very hard. The first set of four Hollow soldiers
was surprisingly hard because of their ranged attacks, then once
you got to the sewer, those huge giants were intense. I made a few
attempts against the boss but couldn't get summoned very
much. Before I did this though, I thought it might be fun to go to
the Belfry Luna... that was insane! I think I may unplug my
machine to do it. Next I popped into Shaded Wood, which was very
painful to get into. Eventually I spawned the enemies and then ran
into the little rooms so I couldn't get surrounded. It felt very
cool. Next I went over to the Huntsman's Copse and went rather
quickly through it after helping a few people. I still need to go
back and explore it more and see what it is connected to.

Throughout the day, I lost about 80k souls. The worst case was
when I lost 50k to the Lost Bastille zombie things when I ran
passed and attracted a ton of them and couldn't get back. 

This game is so rad.
