It was tough to
go through the Giant memories. It took a very long time to get the
Great Lance, but it was awesome once I had it. It took me many
many tries against the Giant Lord, as well. I tried to use
Pyromancy, but got trashed. Then I tried to snipe him with Poison
arrows and it eventually worked, but I ran out of time a few
times. The next thing I did was spend a ton of time fighting King
Vendrick. I eventually used the Old Whip against him and had to
try so many times I cleared the area. After that, I went over to
the end of the game and helped someone beat it, which wasn't
tough. I immediately went at it myself with two helpers. One
helper died at the very end of the first part of the battle, but
the other guy and I creamed the final form. The ending was very
ambiguous and much more clearly connected to Dark Souls 1 than
many other parts of the game. Next, I went over to get the King's
Set so I could end the game with a crown on.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I don't feel like it was any
better or worse than Dark Souls 1. I think the main difference was
the teleporting, so you didn't spend as much time traversing areas
and it didn't matter as much that everything was in "lanes" rather
than an interconnected world. I prefer the gameplay of this
version, but I prefer the world beating of the old game.
