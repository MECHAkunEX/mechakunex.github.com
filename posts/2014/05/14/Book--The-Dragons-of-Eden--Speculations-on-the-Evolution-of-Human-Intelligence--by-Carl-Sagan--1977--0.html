I love this
medium-weight science reads. I think the two most interesting parts
of the book for me were how excited Sagan was about computer games
and all the parts about teaching apes sign language.

The exciting thing about the game discussion was how he clearly
says that games are great because they teach an intuitive
understanding of complex systems, like physics. I feel this way
very strongly about games like Mario. In this same section, he
relates the idea that writing makes us forget rather than
remember. Here's the quote from Plato's Phaedrus he uses:

"But when they came to letters, This, said Thoth, will make the
Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific
both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most
ingenious Thoth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the
best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the
users of them. And in this instance, you who are the father of
letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to
attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this
discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners'
souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to
the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The
specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to
reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the
semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will
have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will
generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the
show of wisdom without the reality."

But I was really blown away by the discussion of the primates and
their understanding of language and logic. I think I cried when I
read what one chimpanzee wrote to her machine: "Please, machine,
tickle Lana." It's so beautiful. It makes me want to get involved
in teaching them language and advancing their species. I seriously
cried in the middle of the airport waiting for a flight when I read
that.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1977/">1977</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
