mail. I was a huge fan of the previous games in the series, so I
was definitely looking forward to this.

The installation process took a long time and I wish I started it
earlier in the day, before I wanted to play. I like that you can
get the Japanese voice-over track, but I don't think I want to use
it, because I'm used to everyone's voices.

The game starts pretty nice and I'm enjoying the battle system. I
think it is a little weird that the added back in the HP meta-game
that was gone in previous FF13s. I find the random battles to be
incredibly easy, but in the graveyard on the main quest, they were
incredibly hard and I had to run from quite a few of them. I hope
that I can go back and train a bit on them.

The time constraint in the game is very oppressive to me, because
it feels like I don't have enough time to do what I want and
definitely not enough to grind. I spent about 8 hours of game time
looking for the final code that I would never have been able to
find because it could only be found in a place that was sealed
during the day. I wish I had used that time to go to one of the
other regions or something.

I'm not finding the customization to be super useful. I've got one
schemata for "Ravager", "Commando", and "Sentinel" each, and then
I'm just optimizing their pieces based on what new things I get. I
feel like I want a little bit more customization and a better
split between the powers I want and the way I want Lightning to
look. I'm sure this will get better as the game progresses, but
it's something I'm noticing now.

I really like the game though!
