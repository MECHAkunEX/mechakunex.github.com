I felt like I mostly just ran
around the Wildlands as I tried to do the Animal Crossing
minigames to get the Chocobo back to health. I found the Dryads to
be incredibly difficult, because I didn't have any magic equipped
except for Elementa, which healed them. I think I'm getting to the
point in the game where I can't use it anymore because most
enemies are healed by some element. 

I was able to get the Etro village even though I didn't heal my
Chocobo all the way because I tried very hard on the jump. This
let me fight the boss that changes which kind of magic it
absorbs. It was a really hard boss and I died the first time. It
forced me to revise my schemata and I came up with a much more
powerful and diverse combination. My Sentinel role now is
basically impervious because of the hood you get from Snow,
although that means I can't attack all. I think I will compensate
that by adding some buffing or debuffing to it. Then I changed to
a different Ravager setup with a wider variety of spells. I was
able to beat the boss in no time, but when I got back to the
village to turn it in, the leader was gone. Ugh, so annoying.

I took a slight diversion to go see Vanille, which was cool, but I
was surprised that there wasn't more to do on that line. I get a
feeling from that part like Valkyrie Profile where the true way to
"win" the game is do ignore what you're supposed to do and find
some other secret path. I'm doubtful that this game is so
subversive though.

I'm on my way to the Temple of Etro now though. I can't decide if
I'll do Sazh next or go to the Dead Dunes for the first time.
