I still enjoyed it, but some cliches
appear to be coming out that drag it down a little. For instance,
the writer writing about a writer writing a book is becoming a bit
thicker; the son being the best kid in the school is too perfect;
the father losing his brother in an undisclosed way; and, finally
at the end of chapter 13, he ends with the school doing something
slightly sinister. I would expect the book to more powerful and
interesting if the school is totally on the level, but it was just
a story about the regret and growing up-angst that the father
feels.

Another thing that bugs me so far is that the father doesn't seem
to be concerned about how the son feels about the
school. Apparently, they've had regular interaction because they
talk about quarterly visits and how Christopher wasn't needy. But
how would Christopher feel about leaving the school? Presumably he
feels alienation for the same reasons that the father feels
longing. I know that when I was young, I wouldn't appreciate being
pulled out of what I like to satisfy my dad's need for family
time. In fact, I /know/ that I would dislike it, because I did
dislike it when it really happened to me. I hope that the book
explores these issues and the son isn't just a McGuffin.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2014/">2014</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
