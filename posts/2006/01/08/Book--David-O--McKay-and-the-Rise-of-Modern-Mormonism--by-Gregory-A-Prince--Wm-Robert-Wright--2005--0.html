personal secretary over his tenure as a General Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book contains many insights on a particularly formative
time in the Church's history. I will try to quote some parts that
I find most interesting and/or inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once when McKay was getting gas at a pump station, a kid who
was not quite on the right track had an interesting interaction
with him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had the temerity to say, "When was the last time you
talked to God, President McKay?" No properly brought-up LDS
kid would ever do that. You might wonder, you might think
about that, but who would say that? This kid came back to the
service station really quite shaken and shared this story with
the other kids. [...] President McKay said, "It was last
week." Now, he left everybody wondering what he really meant
by that, whether he was praying, talking to God, or whether it
was another kind of experience. But the way it was said, it
really left this kid shaken up [... and] it really turned him
around. [p. 26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Chapter 2 is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7 on what exactly `correlation' was is interesting. I
personally find it to be very sensible and a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter on temple building is very interesting. I thought
the idea that Mark Garff, chairman of the Building Committee,
offered, about a temple-ship was quite incredible. Imagine what
that would've been like! (p. 273)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found all the discussion of Ezra Taft Benson quite
inspiring. I got a strong feeling that when Benson dropped his
politics as he became president that it was a very spiritual
experience, whereby he realized the importance and impact of his
earthly work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great quote related to LDS chaplains in the military:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Johnson said, "Listen here, these *REDACTED*s, from
the minute they are out of their mothers' womb, have been
praying and teaching and leading one another, and then they go
out on missions." He said, "I would rather have one of their
boys than one of the preachers you get out of the seminary, so
you fix it up so that they can get their chaplains."
[p. 357]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of McKay's final days was very faith-promoting, as he
was able to garner enough strength for conference speeches and
advisory discussion, but generally was in rough shape.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
