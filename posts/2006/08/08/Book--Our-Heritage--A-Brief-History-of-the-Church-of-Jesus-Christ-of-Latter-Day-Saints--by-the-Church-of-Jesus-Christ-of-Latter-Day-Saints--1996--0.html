&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincenzo di Francesca, an Italian minister of religion, was
walking down a New York City street toward his church when
he saw a book without a cover in a barrel full of ashes. He
picked up the book, turned the pages, and saw for the first
time the names Nephi, Mosiah, Alma, and Moroni. He felt
impressed to read the book even though he did not know its
name or origin, and to pray about its truthfulness. As he
did, he said that “a feeling of gladness, as of finding
something precious and extraordinary, bore consolation to my
soul and left me with a joy that human language cannot find
words to describe.” He began teaching the principles in the
book to the members of his church. His church leaders
disciplined him for doing so and even directed him to burn
the book, something he refused to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He later returned to Italy, where in 1930 he learned that
the book was published by The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. He wrote a letter to the Church in *REDACTED*
that was forwarded to President Grant. President Grant sent
him a copy of the Book of *REDACTED* in Italian and gave his
name to the president of the European mission. The
difficulties of wartime prevented Vincenzo from being
baptized for many years, but he was finally able to become a
member of the Church on 18 January 1951, the first person
baptized on the island of Sicily. Five years later he was
endowed in the Swiss Temple. [p. 109]&lt;/p&gt;
