my Aunt a few weeks ago about how I'd like to experience the pain of
reading it straight through and really experience what it is. After
going through this, the book is much different than I expected it to
be. I had expected a lot more warring Angels and didn't expect so
much retelling of the Old Testament. Also, I expected more
monologues by Satan. I certainly agree with Satan as the hero, but I
was surprised how he was not always on the forefront of all the
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The army of Satan have arrived in Hell and discuss their next
move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan makes the most important point: Whatever they will do, they
must continue to resist God. Furthermore, he warns the fallen Angels
that God will attempt to subvert their challenges and turn their
evil into good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do aught good never will be our task,&lt;br/&gt;
But ever to do ill our sole delight,&lt;br/&gt;
As being the contrary to his high will&lt;br/&gt;
Whom we resist. If then his Providence&lt;br/&gt;
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,&lt;br/&gt;
Our labour must be to pervert that end,&lt;br/&gt;
And out of good still to find means of evil; [l. 159-165]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan rallies the troops by asserting that even though they are
in Hell, they can still pursue the freedom that he convinced them
was only attainable through resistance of God. Being in Hell should
have no effect on their resolve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind is its own place, and in itself&lt;br/&gt;
Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.&lt;br/&gt;
What where, if I be still the same,&lt;br/&gt;
And what I should be, all but less than hee&lt;br/&gt;
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least&lt;br/&gt;
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built&lt;br/&gt;
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:&lt;br/&gt;
Here we may reign secure, and in my choice&lt;br/&gt;
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:&lt;br/&gt;
Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n. [l. 254-263]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the above to be such a wonderful summary of the lies of
Satan. They represent not only his beguiling of his army, but of Man
as well. (Also, finally reading that final famous line was
awing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consultation begun, Satan debates whether another Battle be
to be hazarded for the recovery of Heaven: some advise it, others
dissuade: A third proposal is preferr'd, mention'd before by
Satan, to search the truth of that Prophecy or Tradition in Heaven
concerning another world, and another kind of creature equal or
not much inferior to themselves, about this time to be created:
Thir doubt who shall be sent on this difficult search: Satan thir
chief undertakes alone the voyage, is honour'd and applauded. The
Council thus ended, the rest betake them several ways and to
several employments, as thir inclinations lead them, to entertain
the time till Satan return. He passes on his Journey to Hell
Gates, finds them shut, and who sat there to guard them, by whom
at length they are op'n'd, and discover to him the great Gulf
between Hell and Heaven; with what difficulty he passes through,
directed by Chaos, the Power of that place, to the sight of this
new World which he sought. [The Argument]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about Milton's description of the high-ranking
devils is their deceptiveness and their indistinguishability against
the Angels of Heaven:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On th' other side up rose&lt;br/&gt;
Belial, in act more graceful and humane;&lt;br/&gt;
A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seem'd&lt;br/&gt;
For dignity compos'd and high exploit:&lt;br/&gt;
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue&lt;br/&gt;
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear&lt;br/&gt;
The better reason, to perplex and dash&lt;br/&gt;
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;&lt;br/&gt;
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds&lt;br/&gt;
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, [l. 108-117]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammon's discourse is another great example of the typical lies
of Satan: that obedience is for the benefit of God, not ourselves;
and that there can be anything separate from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose he should relent&lt;br/&gt;
And publish Grace to all, on promise made&lt;br/&gt;
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we&lt;br/&gt;
Stand in his presence humble, and receive&lt;br/&gt;
Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne&lt;br/&gt;
With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing&lt;br/&gt;
Forc't Halleluiahs; while he Lordly sits&lt;br/&gt;
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes&lt;br/&gt;
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,&lt;br/&gt;
Our servile offerings. This must be our task&lt;br/&gt;
In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisome&lt;br/&gt;
Eternity so spent in worship paid&lt;br/&gt;
To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue&lt;br/&gt;
By force impossible, by leave obtain'd&lt;br/&gt;
Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state&lt;br/&gt;
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek&lt;br/&gt;
Our own good from ourselves, and from our own&lt;br/&gt;
Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,&lt;br/&gt;
Free, and to none accountable, preferring&lt;br/&gt;
Hard liberty before the easy yoke&lt;br/&gt;
Or servile Pomp. [l. 237-257]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan's proposal to attack Man on Earth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here perhaps&lt;br/&gt;
Some advantageous act may be achiev'd&lt;br/&gt;
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire&lt;br/&gt;
To waste his whole Creation, or possess&lt;br/&gt;
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,&lt;br/&gt;
The puny habitants, or if not drive,&lt;br/&gt;
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God&lt;br/&gt;
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand&lt;br/&gt;
Abolish his own works. This would surpass&lt;br/&gt;
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy&lt;br/&gt;
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise&lt;br/&gt;
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons&lt;br/&gt;
Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse&lt;br/&gt;
Thir frail Original, and faded bliss,&lt;br/&gt;
Faded so soon. [l. 362-376]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the last book, Satan traveled across Chaos. Now, he
approaches Earth and God comments to Christ that he will succeed and
they discuss the eventual Atonement. Satan sneaks past the guards of
Earth and prepares to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book IV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan spies on Adam and Eve. The Angels discover his trespass and
prepare to guard Paradise and Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan laments his choices that seem to now force him into a
particular path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is there no place&lt;br/&gt;
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?&lt;br/&gt;
None left but by submission; and that word&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Disdain&lt;/em&gt; forbids me, and my dread of shame&lt;br/&gt;
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd&lt;br/&gt;
With other promises and other vaunts&lt;br/&gt;
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue&lt;br/&gt;
Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know&lt;br/&gt;
How dearly I abide that boast so vain,&lt;br/&gt;
Under what torments inwardly I groan:&lt;br/&gt;
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,&lt;br/&gt;
With Diadem and Sceptre high advanc'd&lt;br/&gt;
The lower still I fall, only Supreme&lt;br/&gt;
In misery; such joy Ambition finds. [l. 79-92]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning about their sole commandment, Satan makes his plan
and departs from his spying with these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live while ye may,&lt;br/&gt;
Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,&lt;br/&gt;
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. [l. 533-535]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel assaults Satan and drives him out of Paradise and asks
him why he comes, Satan responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,&lt;br/&gt;
And such I held thee; but this question askt&lt;br/&gt;
Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain?&lt;br/&gt;
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,&lt;br/&gt;
Though thither doom'd? Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt,&lt;br/&gt;
And boldly venture to whatever place&lt;br/&gt;
Farthest from pain, where though might'st hope to change&lt;br/&gt;
Torment with ease, and soon recompense&lt;br/&gt;
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;&lt;br/&gt;
To thee no reason; who know'st only good,&lt;br/&gt;
But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object&lt;br/&gt;
His will who bound us? [l. 886-897]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book V&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raphael warns Adam of Satan's pending temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book VI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raphael tells Adam of the War in Heaven lead by Michael and
Gabriel. The War is ended by Christ chariot assault. Raphael warns
Adam again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan, hee who envies now thy state,&lt;br/&gt;
Who now is plotting how he may seduce&lt;br/&gt;
Thee also from obedience, that with him&lt;br/&gt;
Bereav'd of happiness thou mayst partake&lt;br/&gt;
His punishment, Eternal misery;&lt;br/&gt;
Which would be all his solace and revenge,&lt;br/&gt;
As a despite done against the most High,&lt;br/&gt;
Thee once to gain Companion of his woe. [l. 900-907]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book VII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raphael describes the creation of the universe by Christ at the
behest of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book VIII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam tells Raphael about his first few days of life and meeting
Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's promise to Adam of Eve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,&lt;br/&gt;
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,&lt;br/&gt;
Thy wish, exactly to thy heart's desire. [l. 449-451]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book IX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan having compast the Earth, with meditate guile returns as a
mist by Night into Paradise, enters into the Serpent
sleeping. Adam and Eve in the Morning go forth to thir labours,
which Eve propose to divide into several places, each labouring
apart: Adam consents not, alleging the danger, lest that Enemy, of
whom they were forewarn'd, should attempt her found alone: Eve
loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges her
going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her strength;
Adam at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone; his subtle
approach, first gazing, then speaking, with much flattery
extolling Eve above all other Creatures. Eve wond'ring to hear the
Serpent speak, asks how he attain'd to human speech and such
understanding not till now; the Serpent answers, that by tasting
of a certain Tree in the Garden he attain'd both to Speech and
Reason, till then void of both: Eve requires him to bring her to
that Tree, and finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden: The
Serpent now grown bolder, with many wiles and arguments induces
her at length to eat; she pleas'd with the taste deliberates
awhile whether to impart thereof to Adam or not, at last brings
him of the Fruit, relates what persuaded her to eat thereof: Adam
at first amaz'd, but perceiving her lost, resolves through
vehemence of love to perish with her; and extenuating the
trespass, eats also of the Fruit: The effects thereof in them
both; they seek to cover thir nakedness; then fall to variance and
accusation of one another. [The Argument]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Adam's argument against separating for labour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd&lt;br/&gt;
Labour, as to debar us when we need&lt;br/&gt;
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,&lt;br/&gt;
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse&lt;br/&gt;
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,&lt;br/&gt;
To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,&lt;br/&gt;
Love not the lowest end of human life. [l. 235-242]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan's tempting verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queen of this Universe, do not believe&lt;br/&gt;
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:&lt;br/&gt;
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life&lt;br/&gt;
To Knowledge: By the Threat'ner? look on mee,&lt;br/&gt;
Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,&lt;br/&gt;
And life more perfet have attain'd than Fate&lt;br/&gt;
Meant mee, by vent'ring higher than my Lot.&lt;br/&gt;
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast&lt;br/&gt;
Is open? or will God incense his ire&lt;br/&gt;
For such a petty Trespass, and not praise&lt;br/&gt;
Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain&lt;br/&gt;
Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,&lt;br/&gt;
Deterr'd not from achieving what might lead&lt;br/&gt;
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;&lt;br/&gt;
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil&lt;br/&gt;
Be real, why not known, since easier shunn'd?&lt;br/&gt;
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;&lt;br/&gt;
Not just, not God; not fear'd then, nor obey'd:&lt;br/&gt;
Your fear itself of Death removes the fear.&lt;br/&gt;
Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe,&lt;br/&gt;
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,&lt;br/&gt;
His worshippers; he knows that in the day&lt;br/&gt;
Ye Eat thereof, your Eyes that seem so clear,&lt;br/&gt;
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then&lt;br/&gt;
Op'n'd and clear'd, and ye shall be as Gods,&lt;br/&gt;
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.&lt;br/&gt;
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [l. 684-710]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam follows Eve in the Fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I live without thee, how forgo&lt;br/&gt;
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly join'd,&lt;br/&gt;
To live again in these wild Woods forlorn?&lt;br/&gt;
Should God create another Eve, and I&lt;br/&gt;
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee&lt;br/&gt;
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel&lt;br/&gt;
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,&lt;br/&gt;
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State&lt;br/&gt;
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [l. 908-916]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angels report to God of the Fall. Satan returns to Hell and
receives praise. "God foretells the final Vicory of his Son over
them, and the renewing of all things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book XI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ forgives Adam and Eve and clothes them. Michael shows Adam
a vision of the event up to the Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book XII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael continues showing visions and then leads the first
Parents out of Paradise and into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
