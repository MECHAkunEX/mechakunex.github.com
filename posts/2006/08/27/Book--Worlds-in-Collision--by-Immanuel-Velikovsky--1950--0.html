ancient people are not to be looked down as ignorant and
superstitious, and given this, their records are to be seen as
containing some measure of accuracy. In many situations, these
records, however, are `only' stories and legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the problem of the similarity in the motifs in
the folklore of various peoples is, in my view, as follows: A great
many ideas reflect real historic content. There is a legend, found
all over the world, that a deluge swept over the earth and covered
hills and mountains. We have a poor opinion of the mental abilities
of our ancestors if we think that merely an extraordinary overflow
of the Euphrates so impressed the nomads of the desert that they
thought the entire world was flooded, and that the legend so born
wandered from people to people. At the same time, geological
problems of the origin and distribution of till, or diluvial
deposit, are awaiting explanation. [p. 304]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach is to identify similarities in the majority of legends
across the world, then look for explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the explanations are always related to the influence
of celestial bodies, specifically comets and planets. In Velikovsky's
words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres
is the point of departure of the present-day concept of the world
as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the theory
of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are
sacrosanct, this book is a heresy. However, modern physics, of
atoms and of the quantum theory, describes dramatic changes in the
microcosm---the atom---the prototype of the solar system; a
theory, then, that envisages not dissimilar events in the
macrocosm---the solar system---brings the modern concepts of
physics to the celestial sphere. [p. vii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Velikovsky allows the idea that solar system and the Earth
was not always as it is now in recorded history to be considered. I
find it interesting that &lt;strong&gt;the work is based on records
typically seen as closed-minded (legends and the Bible,) but is
extremely open-minded as compared to the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;---the
scientists---that is typically seen as open-minded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first core idea is that Venus was once a comet, and that prior
to being caught by the Sun, it made a collision with Earth. This
collision came at the time of the Hebrew Exodus and caused events that
were interpreted by the Israelites as miracles. Similar events are
reported across the world, but---interesting--are considered as a
horrible punishment, rather than a blessing. There is a huge catalog
of hundreds of pages of citations of the histories of other peoples
covering many aspects of the reported miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record of manna across the world is very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maoris in the Pacific, the Jews on the order of Asia and
Africa, the Hindus, the Finns, the Icelanders, all describe the
honey-food being dropped from the clouds, dreary shades of the
shadow of death, that enveloped the earth after a cosmic
catastrophe. All traditions agree also that the source of the
heavenly bread falling from the clouds with the morning dew was a
celestial body. [p. 137]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of Venus from early planet systems is particularly
well documented, something I had never known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second core idea is that Venus had an impact with Mars and
changed its orbit. This collision and subsequent change was witnessed
by the world and shows up in the legends of the battle between gods
representing Venus and Mars across the world. This is said to have
happened during the Hebrew conquest of Palestine after the wandering
in the Wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea contained in the book is the idea that the rotation of
the Earth was once different. This is manifested in a longer year (365
and a quarter, rather than 360, days) as documented by many changes in
calendars around the world at approximately the same time (seventh
century B.C..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could the stargazers who composed the earlier tablets be so
careless as to maintain that the year is 360 days long, a mistake
that in six years accumulates to a full month of divergence; or
how could the astronomers of the royal observatories announce to
the kind the movements of the moon and its phases on wrong dates,
though a child can tell when the moon is new, and the record all
this in very scholarly tablets requiring advanced mathematical
knowledge? Hence scholars speak of "enigmatic mistakes."
[p. 350]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting theological comments are made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish people did not obtain all of its "supremacy" in that
one day at the Mountain of Lawgiving; this people did not receive
the message of monotheism as a gift. It struggled for it; and step
by step, from the smoke rising from the overturned valley of Sodom
and Gomorrah, from the furnace of affliction of Egypt, from the
deliverance at the Red Sea amid the sky-high tides, from the
wandering in the cloud-enshrouded desert burning with naphtha,
from the internal struggle, from the search for God and for
justice between man and man, from the desperate and heroic
struggle for national existence on its narrow strip of land
against the overwhelming empires of Assyria and Egypt, it became a
nation chosen to bring a message of the brotherhood of man to all
the peoples of the world. [p. 297]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting historical notes are mentioned for comparison
with the ancient past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eruptions of volcanoes are also accompanied by loud
noises. The sound produced by Krakatoa in the East Indies, during
the eruption of 1883, was so loud that it was heard as far as
Japan, 3,000 miles away, the farthest distance traveled by sound
recorded in modern annals. [p. 96]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; is that this work is accurate in
general and interesting in the details. It is not feasible for me to
verify every citation of ancient peoples' folklore, but I have heard
enough of the brief versions of many peoples' stories to pick up a
bit. Additionally, I can identify a few parts in this book where
Velikovsky obviously gets scientific details wrong, or ascribes a bit
too much to the comets. If this work were not such heresy, it seems to
me a very valuable research plan for understanding ancient history.&lt;/p&gt;
