&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could easily write a volume on Brigham Young as husband
and father of one of the most unusual families in American
history, another on his thirty years as Church President,
still another on his six years as governor, a fourth on his
six years as superintendent of Indian affairs, a fifth on his
activities in founding more than three hundred settlements in
the Great Basin, a sixth on his business interests and
economic enterprises, and a final one on his thought---his
theological and doctrinal beliefs and assertions. But I have
concluded that the proper place to begin is with a one-volume
survey. [p. xvi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Brigham's stones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he introduced himself by saying, "I am the notorious
Brigham Young." But when one of his followers expressed
concern about his reputation, Brigham responded, "Don't fret
your gizzard over that." And about the time of Greeley's visit
Brigham remarked to his replacement as governor: "I care
nothing about my character in this world. I do not care what
men say about me. I want my character to stand fair in the
eyes of my Heavenly Father." [p. 6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham on following the Word of Wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have conceived from my youth up that I could have my
liberty and independence just as much in doing right as I
could in doing wrong. [p. 23]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never realized the official name of the Kirtland Safety
Society. After being denied a bank charter, Joseph Smith and
company founded the Kirtland Safety
Society &lt;strong&gt;Anti-Banking&lt;/strong&gt; Association. Arington adds,
"If the establishment of a bank was illegal, the founding of an
antibank was not." (p. 57) Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham was once commanded to renounce *REDACTED*ism or perish in
the early days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will see you in hell first... Renounce my religion? No,
sir... it is my all, all I have on this earth. What is this
world worth as it is now? Nothing. It is like a morning
shadow; it is like the dew before the sun, like the grass
before the scythe, or the flower before the pinching frosts of
autumn. No, sir, I do not renounce my religion. [p. 67]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham's pragmatic approach to management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Fielding [...] told of a case in which a man had
done some ugly things and placed the blame on an evil
spirit. Very well, said Brigham, "the blame must be laid on
that spirit, and if we could get at him we would cut him off
from the Church. But we do not know how to get hold of him
unless we take hold of the person possessed by it."
[p. 88]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Brigham was first introduced to polygamy by Joseph Smith,
he had to think very hard about it. The chapter on Nauvoo has a
few pages of his journal during this time where he works through
it. (p. 100-101) Very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Brigham helped establish much of Church management
and doctrine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigham was asked whether any officer in any branch of the
church could say this his word was law and must be
obeyed. Answer: "He can say that his world is law, but does
that make it so? Yes, if he has the law of God, and delivers
it, otherwise it is not." [p. 106]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pioneer: "We are as comfortable and happy as most of the
stationary communities. For if we have not all that our wants may
call for, we have the art of lessening our wants, which does as
well." (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham on the Word of God: "I believe the words of the Bible
are just what they are." (p. 197)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman (Elizabeth Green) asked to be taken off the member
list. Brigham's reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madam: I have this day examined the records of baptisms for
the remission of sins in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, and not being able to find the name of "Elizabeth
Green" recorded therein I was saved the necessity of erasing
your name therefrom. You may therefor consider your sins have
not been remitted you and you may consequently enjoy the
benefits therefrom. [p. 199]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham and Sabbath observance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigham called to mind Adam Clark, of whom it was said, "If
the clock struck twelve on Saturday night, and he happened to
have but one shoe blacked, he would drop the blacking and
brushes, and go to meeting next day with one shoe blacked and
the other unblacked." That might be esteemed a pious example
by some, said Brigham, but to him it was "a waymark to the
kingdom of folly." [p. 200]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading about the *REDACTED* War and the *REDACTED* Raiders was very
cool. They were tough+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan to raze Salt Lake City before giving it up was called
the Sebastol Plan, after a similar Russian action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...it is not Sebastopol which we have left to them, but the
burning ruins of the town, which we ourselves set fire to,
having maintained the honour of defence in such a manner that
our grandchildren may recall with pride the remembrance of it
and send it on to all posterity. [p. 264]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham once said to a group of men in Fillmore: "Ye Elders and
young men, cort up the girls and marry them and not let them go to
the Gentiles. &lt;strong&gt;I cannot take them all&lt;/strong&gt;."
(p. 306)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a requirement to be married in the Celestial
Kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask can a man be saved with but one wife? if he can, in
what Kingdom? I answer, a man can be saved in the Celestial
Kingdom with no wife at all, and a woman with no husband, and
of course, then, a man can be saved in the Celestial Kingdom
with but one wife. [p. 317]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation of the much cited case of Brigham claiming not to
have been married to one of his wives in a divorce trial. The
woman was the undivorced wife of another man and this took place
many years after their separation as part of a political
challenge.
