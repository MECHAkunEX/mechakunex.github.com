under siege:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has sent us and has brought us
here so that we may extricate those
who so desire from servitude to the
people [here on earth] and make them
servants of God; that we may transform
their poverty in this world into
affluence, and that we may free them
from the inequity of the religions and
bestow on them the justice of
Islam. He has sent us to bring His
religion to His creatures and to call
them to Islam. Whoever accepts it from
us, we shall be content. We shall
leave him on his land to rule it with
us; but whoever refuses, we shall
fight him, until we fulfill the
promise of God. (Tabari 1992, 12: 67)
[p. 6-7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a theory of the rise of Islam that links
it with the rise of trade in Mecca. However...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not the sort of trade that
would put Mecca on the map. Which
explains why, in fact, Mecca was not
on anyone's map. No one in the wider
world seems to have had any idea where
Mecca was, or even that it existed,
before the Arab conquests (Crone
1987a: 134). [p. 17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the focal point of Shi'i Islam, Husayn and
someone who filled a similar role in the succession
battle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr present an
ironic contrast. Ibn al-Zubayr had a
fair amount of political and military
success and at one time ruled a vast
expanse of the empire; today, only the
specialists in Islamic history know
his name. Husayn, on the other hand,
was an abject political and military
failure; yet his martyrdom altered
history and his passion is reenacted
yearly by millions of Shi'i
Muslims. [p. 40]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting discussion near the end of
the section on Islamic Origins (p. 43) about how
Muhammad is not mentioned in early writing about
Islam, despite the wide mentioning of Allah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the origins of the Qur'an...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking characteristic of the Qur'an is the
extraordinary uniformity of the Arabic text in all
extant editions. (This assertion applies only to
the consonants in the text, not the vowels.)
Whether we compare modern printed editions or the
oldest manuscripts, the basic Arabic text in any
given Qur'an is consistent with every other --- so
consistent, in fact, that when small anomalies are
discovered they loom large. [...] For at least
twelve centuries the text has proven remarkably
immune to the forces of time. [p. 55]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect of the Qur'an is how
often Christianity is mentioned with severe emphasis
on the heresy of particular (Trinitarian) strands of
Christian theology. [p. 59]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reading the Qur'an as an unstudied outsider...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get at the meaning of the
Qur'an, one might think, would be to pick up a
translation and read it for oneself. Inexpensive
translations are accessible enough, after all, and
why should one read a textbook synopsis when one
can read the original, which happens to be rater
more interesting? This is excellent advice for
anyone who wishes to read the Qur'an for personal
edification. It turns out to be very poor advice
for anyone concerned to understand how Muslims
approach the content of the Qur'an. A simple
comparison will make this clear. Suppose that a
student unfamiliar with the Bible, but knowing it
to be Christian scripture, was to begin reading it
to try to understand Christianity. She would like
begin at the beginning, in Genesis, and before she
was a quarter of the way through she would not
need to read any further to know that Christianity
is a religion that condones child sacrifice,
misogyny, and genocide. If our student had some
vague impression of endemic violence, wife
battering, and child abuse in Western societies
she would immediately know where to place the
blame. The dominant religious tradition of Western
civilization is quite obviously a misogynistic and
violent religion, as anyone who begins to read its
scriptures can immediately see. [p. 63]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the Qur'an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall thrust of the Qur'an is remarkably
simple, and can be summarized in one paragraph. It
begins, of course, with God. God is One, the
Creator of all that is, including humankind. We
humans owe God exclusive allegiance and worship,
but we tend to allow our attention to wander and
to associate created beings with God. Such
association, called &lt;em&gt;shirk&lt;/em&gt;, is the most
basic of sins. God is merciful, however, and that
mercy is most clearly manifested in the form of
prophets and scriptures sent as reminders to call
forgetful humans back to exclusive worship of
God. [p. 64]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A page from Islamic history... when the Medinans
were defeated by the Meccans after the opposite
circumstance, the Meccans claimed to have "evened the
score", but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this 'Umar made the famous reply: "We are
not equal. Our dead are in paradise; your dead in
hell." [p. 80]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Prophet's declaration that "My community
will never agree upon an error", some Islamic schools
of legal thought focus on consensus. This is an
interesting question that all religions and legal
questions should ask... how important is consensus,
and can a group in complete agreement still be wrong?
[p. 123] Notably in Islam, this is a "hard sell among
the Shi'a" (p. 125).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://palestinianphilosopher.wordpress.com/2006/07/13/the-73-sects-of-islam/'&gt;The
73 Sects of Islam&lt;/a&gt; (p. 136)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting discussion of the Crusades
(big deal of Muslims) and the Mongol invasions
(devastating and brilliant, but not as inspiring of
conservativism as is typically thought) in the
chapters on crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amazing paragraph on a particular Islamic law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some modern Muslim men also see no difficulty
with this reading [of the Qur'an], but on the
whole the equation "one man equals two women" does
not go over well in the modern world, especially
among women. [p. 218]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting parallel in Islam with
regards to marriage (Nasr Abu Zayd) and the
consequences of excommunication in restored
Christianity. (p. 219)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wahhabism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one measure of the success of Wahhabism
that is has for so long and so successfully
convinced many non-Muslims that it is the real
thing. [p. 230]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closing thought on Pluralism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God had so willed, he would have made all of
you on community, but [He has not done so] that He
may test you in what He has given you; so compete
in goodness. To God shall you all return and He
will tell you [the Truth] about what you have been
disputing. (Qur'an, Sura 5, verse 48) [p. 231]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
