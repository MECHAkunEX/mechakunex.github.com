his father:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Father, how is it there is so manifest a difference
between the ancient and modern disciples of Jesus Christ and
their doctrines? If, for instance, I had lived in the days of
the Apostles, and believed in Jesus Christ, and had manifest a
wish to become his disciple, Peter or his brethren would have
said to me, 'Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus
Christ for remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift
of the Holy Ghost.' I should then have known definitely and
precisely what to do to be saved. Whereas, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; we go
to the religious minister for instruction, and he tells us we
must experience a mysterious, indefinite and undefinable
something called religion before we can repent and be baptized
acceptably. But, if we inquire how, or by what means we are to
come at this experience, he cannot tell us definitely;..."
[p. 24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Parley was imprisoned and held on trial for the first
time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then observed as follows: "May it please the court, I have
one proposal to make for a final settlement of the things that
seem to trouble you. It is this: if the witnesses who have
given testimony in the case will repent of their false
swearing, and the magistrate of his unjust and wicked judgment
and of his persecution, blackguardism and abuse, and all kneel
down together, we will pray for you, that God might forgive
you in these matters." [p. 49]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parley asks a Baptist minister who does not believe in modern
revelation how he became a minister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why, sir," said he, "I was called by a vocal voice from Heaven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, Mr. Dotson, there is one exception to your general
rule. We come to you with a new revelation, and you reject it,
because there can be no new revelation; and yet you profess to
have a new revelation, God having spoken from the heavens and
called you, and commissioned you to preach eighteen hundred
years after the New Testament was written, and all revelation
finished! How is this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The New Testament no where calls you by name; neither
makes mention of you as a minister of the gospel; but new
revelation does, if we are to believe you. And yet you would
teach your hearers and us, and all the world, to disbelieve
all modern revelation merely because it is new. Consequently,
we are all bound by your own rule to reject your call to the
ministry, and to believe it is a lie."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could say no more. [p. 85]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page 120 starts an amazing blessing given to P. P. Pratt by
Oliver Cowdery. It is the first writing of his I've read, and I am
incredibly intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Richmond jail, Parley records in more detail the talk that
caused Joseph Smith to give his famous rebuke of the
guards. [p. 210]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parley comments after a temple ritual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I
loved---with a pureness---an intensity of elevated, exalted
feeling, which would lift my soul from the transitory things
of this groveling sphere and expand it as the ocean. I felt
that God was my heavenly Father indeed; that Jesus was my
brother, and that the wife of my bosom was an immortal,
eternal companion; a kind ministering angel, given to me as a
comfort, and a crown of glory for ever and ever. In short, I
could now love with the spirit and with the understanding
also. [p. 298]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parley was an amazing defender of plural marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very interesting that after the Saints moved to Salt
Lake, whenever Parley travels he talks about the use of the land
he's traveling through for settlement, whereas before he talked
about other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Parley was traveling South America, he wrote an
interesting letter to Brigham Young about the need to study
languages. Cool! [p. 402]&lt;/p&gt;
