former presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, is a former standard work in the library that
missionaries are encouraged to read and ponder before and during
their missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a really great summary of many of the teachings
of the Church and presents them in a way that is very good for
people new to the faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting quote from a Catholic scholar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day he said to me: "You *REDACTED*s are all
ignoramuses. You don't even know the strength of your
own position. It is so strong that there is only one
other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is
the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is
between Catholicism and *REDACTED*ism. If we are right, you
are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that's
all there is to it. The Protestants haven't a leg to
stand on. For, if we are wrong, they are wrong with us,
since they were a part of us and went out from us; while
if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long
ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter,
as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and
*REDACTED*ism; but if we have not that succession, then such
a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and *REDACTED*ism's
attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the
perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the
restoration of the gospel in latter days." [p. 3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points to the following scripture with regards to the
assertion that God has a physical body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's
hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor
eat, nor smell." (Deuteronomy 4:28) [p. 12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a purely spiritual God lacks these abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a discussion near the end of the book about how
prophets are chosen in the pre-mortal existence, including the
prophet Joseph Smith. Richards then remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same was true with respect to the mission of
Joseph Smith. We have already quoted from his own story,
showing how Satan sought to destroy him when he was but
a boy of fourteen years and went into the woods to
pray. Many other boys of that age had prayed without
Satan's molesting them. Joseph had not yet had any
manifestation from the Lord. Therefore, except for
Satan's knowledge and acquaintance that he brought with
him from the spirit world, he would not have known that
Joseph Smith was different from any other young boy, but
he knew who "the noble and great" spirit were. Remember,
"there was a war in heaven," and Satan led one host, and
he knew who the leading spirits of the opposition
were. [p. 284]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
