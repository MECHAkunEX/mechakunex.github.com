1957. The President at the time, David O. McKay, was asked why
such a difficult book would be assigned, and wasn't it too
difficult? McKay commented that it would be the responsibility of
the quorums to raise themselves
up. (&lt;a href='http://www.makeoutcity.com/Archives/2006/01/08/213100'&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of this book is to study various means by which
the Book of *REDACTED* can be tested and interesting details that
increase our faith in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Changing Scene - Introduction to an Unknown Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of testing books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proving" the Book of *REDACTED* is another matter. You cannot
prove the genuineness of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; document to one who has
decided not to accept it. The scribes and Pharisees of old
constantly asked Jesus for &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, and when it was set
before them in overwhelming abundance they continued to
disbelieve: "O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the
sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" (Matthew
16:3). &lt;strong&gt;When a mans asks for proof we can be pretty
sure that proof is the last thing in the world he really
wants.&lt;/strong&gt; His request is thrown out as a challenge, and
the changes are that he has no intention of being shown
up. After all these years the Bible itself is still not proven
to those who do not choose to believe it, and the eminent
Harry Torczyner now declares that the main problem of Bible
study today is to determine whether or not "the Biblical
speeches, songs and laws are forgeries." So the Book of *REDACTED*
as an "unproven" book finds itself in good company. [p. 4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the modern belief that documents cannot be trusted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the documents do not tell us everything, it does not
follow that they tell us nothing. They are, in fact, the diary
of the human race---that alone can tell us what men have been
doing and thinking all these years. [p. 5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting comment about relating what we read to our
experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who attempts to read a historical source with an eye
to being critical will naturally refer everything in it to his
own experience. In so doing he will quickly discover in the
document the most obvious parallels to the world in which he
lives. This stuff, he decides, could have been written
yesterday, and therefore must have been. If the document is an
ancient one, however, he will also run into absurd and
unfamiliar things so foreign to his experience or that of his
fellows as to prove beyond a doubt that the document is a wild
fabrication. This is the normal method and result of Book of
*REDACTED* criticism, which always finds proof for fraud in two
kinds of matter: (1) that which is obvious and commonplace and
therefore shows that Joseph Smith was simply writing from his
own experience, and (2) that which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; obvious and
commonplace and therefore shows that Joseph Smith was making
it up. The critics, putting their trust in the easy
generalizations of our shallow modern education, are
apparently unaware that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; authentic history of
human beings is bound to contain much that is common and
familiar, while on the other hand any genuine ancient record
of any length is bound to contain much that is strange and
unfamiliar to modern readers. [p. 7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment on the language of the Book of *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today some critics are fond of pointing out that the Book
of *REDACTED* is written in the very language of Joseph Smith's
own society. That is as if a professor of French literature
were to prove Champollion a fraud by showing after patient
years of study that his translation of the Rosetta Stone was
not in Egyptian at all but in the very type of French that
Champollion and his friends were wont to use! The discovery is
totally without significance, of course, because Champollion
never claimed to be writing Egyptian, but to be rendering it
into his own language. To test his &lt;em&gt;Egyptian&lt;/em&gt; claims we
would have to go back not to Grenoble but to Egypt; and for
the same reason, to test the claims of the Book of *REDACTED* to
antiquity we do not go back to the town of Manchester but to
the world from which it purports to come. There is only one
direction from which any ancient writing may be profitably
approached. &lt;em&gt;It must be considered in its original ancient
setting and in no other.&lt;/em&gt; Only there, if it is a forgery,
will its weakness be revealed, and only there, if it is true,
can its claims be vindicated. [p. 8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Changing Scene - A Time for Reexamination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very insightful remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of the Book of *REDACTED* often remark sarcastically
that it is a great pity that the golden plates have
disappeared, since they would very conveniently prove Joseph
Smith's story. They would do nothing of the sort. The presence
of the plates would only prove that there were plates, no
more: it would not prove that Nephites wrote them, or than an
angel brought them, or that they had been translated by the
gift and power of God; and we can be sure that scholars would
quarrel about the writing on them for generations without
coming to any agreement, exactly as they did about the
writings of Homer and parts of the Bible. The possession of
the plates would have a very disruptive effect, and it would
prove virtually nothing. On the other hand, a far more
impressive claim is put forth when the whole work is given to
the world in what is claimed to be a divinely inspired
translation---in such a text any accuse or pretext for
disagreement and speculation about the text is reduced to an
absolute minimum: it is a text which all the world can read
and understand, and is far more miraculous object than any
gold plates would be. [p. 22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Doomed City - Politics in Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nibley spends a great deal of time on pointing out that Lehi
and his family did not consider themselves part of the community
at Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something distinctly patronizing in his
announcement: "I have charity for the Jew---I say Jew, because
I mean them from whence I came. I also have charity for the
Gentiles" (2 Nephi 33:8-9). That is, he has charity for the
Jew because he is a Jew and has charity for everybody anyway!
But when his brother Jacob says, "Behold, the Jews were a
stiffnecked people" and proceeds to expatiate upon their
vices, he obviously excludes himself and his own people from
their number (Jacob 4:14-15). [p. 99]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meaning of Wilderness - The Pioneer Tradition and
the True Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nibley discusses the common occurrence of the righteous
fleeing to the wilderness (desert) to return to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One often hears it suggested that perhaps the Latter-day
Saints overdo the "pioneer business." Yet as far as can be
discovered the true church in every age has been one of
pioneers---wanderers and settlers in the wilderness in the
most literal sense. And in every age the church has been
careful to preserve and recall in the midst of its own trials
the pioneer stories of its own early days and of still earlier
dispensations, thousands of years ago. If the stories are all
strangely alike that is no accident: we can do no better than
to "liken all scriptures unto us," as did Nephi of old, "that
it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi
19:23). [p. 155]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Book of *REDACTED*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the book is very interesting in the astonishing
similarities between the pre-Christ Jewish community at Qumron and
the Book of *REDACTED* societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ties Between the Old World and the New&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things discussed in this chapter: The evidence of
Ezekiel 37:15-23; the details in the many accounts of Noah and the
history in Ether; etc&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1957/">1957</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
