&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people know of Casanova only via his reputation as
something of a womaniser. Which is rather like describing
Paganini as a bit handy with a violin, Einstein as quite good
at physics, or Pele as fairly useful at knocking a leather
ball between two white-painted wooden posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real Casanova did indeed have his lascivious way with a
healthy number of young (and not so young) maidens, not to
mention the plentiful harlots and slatterns with whom he
enjoined, but that is by no means the full extent of his
achievements. For this was a man who, quite apart from his
great achievments in the "Ars Amatoria", dabbled in such a
wide variety of fields that he composed an operetta,
translated Homer's Iliad, wrote papers on philosophy, escaped
from the most secure and notorious prison of 18th century
Europe (the Leads in Venice), hobnobbed with Catherine the
Great, Voltaire, the Pope, and half of pre-revolutionary
Europe's aristocracy (fleecing a fair number in the process),
and generally spent his life living in such an outrageous and
adventurous fashion that even the most daring and imaginative
Hollywood scripwriter would not dare put the story to paper,
for fear of being branded a lunatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is that Giacomo Casanova, self-styled Duc
de Seignalt, was possibly the most interesting human being
ever to have walked the face of the planet. Certainly, he was
the by far the most fascinating person who ever put his life
to paper with such flair, imagination (some would say *too
much* imagination), erudition, and sheer literary style. For
one should not imagine that this is simply a series of
clumsily written tales from the various regal courts, taverns,
and brothels of ancien regime 18th century Europe. No - if
anything, the great surprise of Casanova's story is the sheer
literary talent on display. If he possessed but an ounce or
two of discipline, there is no doubt in my mind that he could
have become a very well respected writer, such is his
descriptive power, and his general skill with words, his
ability to conjure up memorable images, and his acute powers
of observation. As it is, he must still be respected as a
storyteller of the very highest order - giving ground only to
Chaucer and Homer, in my humble opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more, in such a class-ridden age, Casanova
traversed all strata of contemporary society, from Kings to
prostitutes, from nuns and abbots to humble inn-keepers and
vagabonds. A great insight into his character is afforded by
the way in which he takes each person on their merits,
regardless of wealth or social status. Here is a man who can
guffaw over a pint of ale with a drunk and a teenage slattern,
and the next day indulge in acute and informed conversation
with Europe's leading intellectuals on the merits of various
poets and other artists of note, or the pressing political
problems of the age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I find very interesting about Casanova's preface is
his emphasis on his faith in God and his religious beliefs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in the existence of an immaterial God, creator
and lord of all forms; and what proves to me that I have never
doubted it is that I have always counted upon his providence,
turning to him through prayer in all my tribulations and
always finding my prayer granted. Despair kills; prayer
dissipates it; and after praying man trusts and
act. [p. 25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an excellent moral foundation, the inevitable fruit
of the divine principle which were rooted in my hart, I was
all my life the victim of my senses; I have delighted in going
astray and I have constantly lived in error, with no other
consolation than that of knowing I had erred. For this reason
I hope, dear reader, that far from finding my history mere
impudent boasting, you will find that it has the tone suited
to a general confession, though in the style of my narratives
you will find neither a show of repentance nor the constraint
of one who blushes to confess his escapades. My follies are
the follies of youth. You will see that I laugh at them, and
if you are kind you will laugh at them with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will laugh when you discover that I often had no
scruples about deceiving nitwits and scoundrels and fools when
I found it necessary. As for women, this sort of reciprocal
deceit cancels itself out, for when love enters in, both
parties are usually dupes. [p. 27]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casanova's comment on the purpose of reading his memoirs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preface stands to the work as the bill does to the
play. It is to be read. I have not written these memoirs for
those young people who can only save themselves from falling
by spending their youth in ignorance, but for those whom
experience of life has rendered proof against being seduced,
whom living in the fire has transformed into
salamanders. [p. 36]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Casanova was young, he wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discite grammatici cur mascula nomina cunnus&lt;br/&gt;
Et cur femineum mentuala nomen habet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disce quod a domino nomina servus habet [p. 62]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A taste of Casanova's descriptive style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conclusion of my sermon she wiped away my tears with
the front of her shift, never dreaming that by this charitable
act she exposed to my view two rocks eminently adapted to make
the most skillful of pilots suffer shipwreck. [p. 121]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could say no more, for our clinging mouths were no
longer either organs of speech or channels for
respiration. Become a single being at the same instant, we did
not have the strength to restrain our first desire for more
than a minute; it ran its course without the sound of a single
kiss or the least movement on our part. The raging fire which
urged us on was scorching us; it would have burned us had we
tried to restrain it. [p. 290]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
