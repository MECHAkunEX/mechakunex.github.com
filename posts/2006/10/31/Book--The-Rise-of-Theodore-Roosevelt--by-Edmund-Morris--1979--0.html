tossing on my desk and saying, "I don't want to see you reading
anything else until you finish this!" Obviously, I had to
oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main take-away of this book is that Teddy was any
interesting guy, like many are; and, that politicians are filthy
criminals, even the ones who are known as `honest.' Teddy was
interesting in a very Forest Gump-esque way: he seems to have done
everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt is very cute when he writes about his first wife:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Alice was his, Theodore's natural exuberance, so
long bottled up, burst out like champagne. His letters and
diaries for the months following are awash with adoration. "My
sweet, pretty, pure queen, my laughing little love... how
bewitchingly pretty she is! I can not help petting her and
caressing her all the time; and she is such a perfect little
sunshine. I do not believe any man ever loved a woman more
than I love her." [p. 104]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How I love her! She seems like a star of heaven, she is so
far above other girls; my pearl, my pure flower. When I hold
her in my arms there is nothing on earth left to wish for; and
how infinitely bless is my lot... Oh, my darling, my own
bestloved little Queen!" [p. 106]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice eventually died as a result of complications from
childbirth. Teddy managed to destroy almost everything he wrote
about her. Years later, when he courted his second wife, he wrote:
"Were I sure there was a heaven my one prayer would be I might
never go there, lest I should meet those I loved on earth who are
dead." (p. 337)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt wrote of his colleagues in the New York state House
of Representatives: "They never open their mouths, without
subtracting from the sum of human knowledge." (p. 423)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter on Roosevelt's time as the Police Commissioner in
New York City (#19) is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt on President McKinley: "[He] has no more backbone
than a chocolate eclair." (p. 638)&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1979/">1979</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
