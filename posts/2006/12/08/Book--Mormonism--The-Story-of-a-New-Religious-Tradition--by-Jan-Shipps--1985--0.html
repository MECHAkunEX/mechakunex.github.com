&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Christianity thought of themselves in Hebraic
terms. As the saints---for that is what the Bible calls
them---of Solomon's day rejoiced when fire came down
from heaven and the glory of the Lord filled the house
during the consecration of the temple, so at Pentecost
the "latter-day" saints of early Christianity rejoiced
in God's goodness when a rushing mighty wind filled all
the house and cloven tongues like as of fire sat on each
of them. But as Christianity developed, as Jews and
Greeks were together "in Christ" brought beneath the
covenant that God had made with Abraham, it gradually
became clear that the way espoused by the apostles
included important elements that were not a part of
Israel's tradition. Without fully and consciously
realizing that they were doing so, the followers of
Jesus established a new religious tradition. [p. ix]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting parallel between Joseph Smith's account of the
First Vision and other visions of Paul, Abraham, Moses, Enoch,
Adam, etc.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often as the stories of Joseph Smith's visions are
repeated, it is surprising that very little emphasis is
placed on Smith's description of how he was affected by
these two experiences in which he received his divine
calling. At the conclusion of his description of the
1820 experience, Joseph said, "When I came to myself
again, I found myself lying on my back looking up to
heaven... I had no strength." Then, recalling the
aftermath of the night of 21/22 September 1823 in which
his interviews with the angel Moroni "must have occupied
the whole of that night," Joseph said his strength was
so exhausted that when he tried to work alongside his
father as usual he found he could not. Leaving his
father's side, he started back to the house, only to
fall "helpless to the ground, and for a time [to be]
quite unconscious of anything." It stands to reason that
it was the phenomenon of visionary trance to which Smith
referred, and if this is, in fact, correct, then these
trances, coming in response to divine calling, parallel
a similar trance in which Saul became Paul on the road
to Damascus. [p. 10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipps talks a lot about how the early Saints literally
re-lived many stories of the Israelites. Lots of examples, but
when it occurs to you, you can fill in the details for
yourself. (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also writes about how early *REDACTED* *REDACTED*ism was vastly
different than modern *REDACTED*ism. Her hypothesis is that when you
are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the Kingdom of God, there is less reason to do
things to set you apart.
