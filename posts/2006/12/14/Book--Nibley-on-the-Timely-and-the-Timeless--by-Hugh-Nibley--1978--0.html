Madsen's Foreward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is up to date on contemporary scientific
developments but also equipped to explain in
detail their analogues in the seventeenth (or any
other) century. Of course, it is in part the
calling of a historian to learn something old
every day. But Nibley insists that a student is
only a student when "interest reaches excitement."
[p. x]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone once said of Nibley that "It is obscene for
a man to know that much." (p. xi) And: "Hugh
Nibley is simply encyclopedic. Though I do not
agree with his views I hesitate to challenge him;
he knows too much." (p. xii)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley relates a story about a student he met at Berkeley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Berkeley I put too much religion into my
teaching; one young man came to me with a delicate
problem---his parents, he said, had been careful
to give him the most proper and respectable
education available, and now he was going to have
to break the painful news to them---that he had
discovered that there is a God. How could he do it
gently? [p. xxvi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great explanation of the idea of exaltation and
sprouting worlds in the "Treasures in Heaven" chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley discusses the misunderstanding of the call to
Adam to cultivate and dominate the Earth as justification
for everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man's dominion is a call to service, not a
license to exterminate. It is precisely because
men now prey upon each other and shed the blood
and waste the flesh of other creatures without
need that "the world lieth in sin." (D&amp;amp;C
49:19-21.) Such, at least, is the teaching of the
ancient Jews and of modern revelation. [p. 96]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley makes the following comment about biographers of
Joseph Smith who neglect to mention that he was a Prophet:
"It is as if the biographers of Shakespeare were to go on
year after year digging up all the details of his rather
ordinary life, omitting only that, incidentally, he was
credited with writing some remarkable plays." (p. 213)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter also talks about how the main
portraits of the Prophet by anti-*REDACTED*s are all
contradictory. The penultimate contradiction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would feel much better about it if there were
some historical parallels to match this, but I
know of none. In real life lazy loafers do not
write big books, opportunistic charlatans do not
risk their lives in hard and exhausting projects
when by changing their tune they could become rich
and respectable, and ambitious men with keen
insight into human nature don't insist on doing
and saying just the things that are bound to
offend the most people the most. Here is one
authority who confesses that "a mere impostor
would have broken down under such a tempest of
opposition and hate as Smith's preaching
excited. Smith must have been at least in part
honest in his delusion." [p. 222]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing Brigham Young's vision of education among
the saints, he relates this quote on meeting
attendance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Young tried to make the meetings of
the Saints stimulating and adult affairs instead
of humdrum routines. For one thing, "it may
sometimes be just as good and profitable to stay
at home as to come to meeting... I do not believe
that those who stay at home are, in many
instances, any worse than those who come to
meeting, or that those who come to meeting are
particularly better that those who stay home." "If
any of you feel that there is no life in your
meetings... then it becomes your duty to go and
instill life into that meeting, and do your part
to produce an increase of the Spirit and the power
of God in the meetings in your locality." And even
at conference: "... if any of you are not
instructed to your satisfaction, be so kind as to
send up a card to the stand, intimating your
desire to speak, and we will give you an
opportunity of doing so, to display your wisdom;
for we wish to learn wisdom and get
understanding." [p. 242]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also says that children should stay home rather
than interrupt. Hah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conversation Nibley imagines between humans and the
Creator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We: Dear Father, whenever the end is scheduled
to be, can't you give us an extension of
time?&lt;br/&gt;

He: Willingly. But tell me first, what will
you do with it?&lt;br/&gt;

We: Well... ah... we will go on doing pretty
much what we have been doing; after all, isn't
that why we are asking for an extension?&lt;br/&gt;

He: And isn't that exactly why I want to end
it soon---because you show no inclination to
change? Why should I reverse the order of nature
so that you can go on doing the very things I want
to put an end to?&lt;br/&gt;

We: But is what we are doing so terribly
wrong? The economy seems sound enough. Why
shouldn't we go on doing the things which have
made this country great?&lt;br/&gt;

He: Haven't I made it clear enough to you what
kind of greatness I expect of my offspring?
Forget the statistics; you are capable of
better things---your stirring commercials
don't impress me in the least.&lt;br/&gt;

We: But why should we repent when all we are
doing is what each considers to be for the
best good of himself and the nation?&lt;br/&gt;

He: Because it is not you but I who decide
what that shall be, and I have told you a
hundred times hat is best for you individually
and collectively---and that is repentance, no
matter who you are.&lt;br/&gt;

We: We find your inference objectionable,
Sir---quite unacceptable.&lt;br/&gt;

He: I know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
