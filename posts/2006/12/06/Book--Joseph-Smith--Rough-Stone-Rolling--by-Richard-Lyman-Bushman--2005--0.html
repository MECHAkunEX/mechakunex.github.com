&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It] is unlikely there will ever be consensus on
Joseph Smith's character or his achievements. The
multiplication of scholarly studies an the discovery
of new sources have only heightened the controversies
surrounding his life. The central difficulty is that
Joseph Smith lives on in the faith of the *REDACTED*s,
like Abraham in Judaism or Muhammad in
Islam. Everything about Smith matters to people who
have built their lives on his teachings. To protect
their own deepest commitments, believers want to
shield their prophet's reputation. On the other hand,
people who have broken away from *REDACTED*ism---and they
produce a large amount of the scholarship---have to
justify their decision to leave. They cannot
countenance evidence of divine inspiration of his
teachings without catching themselves in a disastrous
error. Added to these combatants are those suspicions
of all religious authority ho find in Joseph Smith a
perfect target for their fears. Given the emotional
crosscurrents, agreement will never be reached about
his character, his inspiration, or his
accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A believing historian like myself cannot hope to
rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal
is at stake. For a character as controversial as
Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. [p. ix]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josiah Quincy, Jr. on Joseph Smith: "If the reader does
not know just what to make of Joseph Smith, I cannot help
him out of the difficulty. I myself stand helpless before
the puzzle." (p. 6) This was forty years after a visit
where the parting remarks were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quincy remarked to Smith, "You have too much power
to be safely trust to one man." Joseph replied that in
Quincy's hands or another person's "so much power
would, no doubt, be dangerous. I am the only man in
the world whom it would be safe to trust with
it. Remember, I am a prophet!" The manner of Joseph's
answer intrigued Quincy. "The last five words were
spoken in a rich, comical aside, as if in hearty
recognition of the ridiculous sound they might have in
the ears of a Gentile." Joseph knew his visitor was
amused and skeptical, yet remained unfazed, sure of
himself no matter what the Bostonian
thought. [p. 7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A re-occurring theme that I noticed throughout the book was
how confident Joseph Smith was in his revelations. From the
preface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He] spoke in God's voice in revelations he
compiled and published. [...] Many thought him
presumptuous if not blasphemous, and he made no effort
to prove them wrong. He did not defend his revelations
or give reasons for belief. He dictated the words and
let people decide. Everything he taught and most of
what he did originated in these revelations. The
question of this book is how such a man came to be in
the age of railroads and the penny press. [p. xx]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another near the end of the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His storytelling was oracular rather than
argumentative. He made pronouncements on the authority
of his own inspiration, heedless of current
opinion. [p. 458]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much-reported explanation of Joseph's
treasure-hunting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it was preparatory
gospel. Treasure-seeking lore may have made it easier
for his father to believe his son's fabulous story
about an angel and gold plates. Joseph Sr. might have
dismissed the report had not tales of spirits guarding
treasure prepared his mind. [p. 54]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the publication of the Book of *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the effort and trouble he put into the
translation, Joseph made little of the book's
appearance. Neither he nor his mother named the day
when bound copies were available. The first edition
said virtually nothing about Joseph himself, the
angel, or the process of translation. The preface
contained one sentence---in the passive voice---about
his part in the work: "I would also inform you that
the plates of which hath been spoken, were found in
the township of Manchester, Ontario county, New-York."
His own name appeared only on the title page and in
the testimony of the eight witnesses at the back. It
was an unusually spare production, wholly lacking in
signs of self-promotion. Joseph presented his
handiwork to the public and moved on. The book
thenceforth had a life of its own. [p. 83]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Indians as the Book of *REDACTED* people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book of *REDACTED* deposited its people on some
unknown shore---not even definitely identified as
America---and had them live out their history in a
remote place in a distant time, using names that had
no connection to modern Indians. [...] Neglecting to
scatter obvious clues through its pages, the Book of
*REDACTED* seems more focused on its own Christian message
than on Indian anthropology. The book refuses to argue
its own theory. [p. 97]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bushman points out that the Book of *REDACTED* was the longest
revelations and "should have" been written last, not first. He
compares Joseph to Emerson (an exact contemporary), who at
that age had nothing but journals to show for
himself. (p. 105)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the dictation of all revelations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or
reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject;
neither did any of these communications undergo
revisions, interlinings, or corrections. As he
dictated them so they stood, so far as I have
witnessed. [p. 130]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recurring theme in the book is that *REDACTED*ism
survived because it was not based fully on Joseph's charisma,
but soon had an organization independent of him to run
on. (p. 251)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On revelations in general and plural marriage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In public nd private, he spoke and acted as if
guided by God. All the doctrines, plans, programs, and
claims were, in his mind, the mandates of heaven. They
came to him as requirements, with a kind of
irresistible certainty. The revelations weighed him
down with impossible tasks like translation,
gathering, constructing a temple, or building a
city. More than once he told the Church he had
completed the work and had no more to accomplish, as
if he hoped the revelations would subside.Then a new
commandment would force itself upon him, and the work
would resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph ordinarily followed the commandments
punctiliously, as if disobedience put him at risk. In
the case of plural marriage, he held off for two or
three years before marrying Fanny Alger, and then
after this one unsuccessful attempt, waited another
five years. The delay showed uncharacteristic
reluctance, hard for one who feared God. [...] By
delaying plural marriage, Joseph risked provoking
God's wrath. [p. 4347]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On how Joseph shared the revelation about plural
marriage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message was always the same: This is a
revelation from God to your prophet. Seek your own
inspiration, and you will know for yourself. If you
deny it, you will lose your blessings. [p. 491]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stories of an initial revulsion combined with a
later spiritual confirmation are told in this
section. (p. 492)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People make a big deal about the similarity of visions in
the Book of *REDACTED* to vision reported to have been seen by
Joseph Smith Sr., however, those visions were recorded by Lucy
almost thirty years later. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people were reporting visions of Christ in the
1820s. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph put much more importance in the visit of Moroni,
than in the First Vision. At least initially. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The problem of history was to hold on to the Gospel, not
to prepare for its coming." (p. 135)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Zion's Camp, Joseph admonished men from killing
rattlesnakes to encourage an attitude where the "Lion [may] lie
down with the Lamb." (p. 241)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Book of Abraham compares well with recent scholarship
on apocryphal literature on Abraham. (p. 292)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1837, Joseph never denied his relationship with Fanny
Alger. He just denied it was adultery. (They were married.)
(p. 325)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Masonic rituals and the temple ceremonies: "Joseph
often request revelation about things that caught his
attention." (p. 449)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph married two sisters (p. 494), I wonder if he
considered Leviticus 18:18:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
