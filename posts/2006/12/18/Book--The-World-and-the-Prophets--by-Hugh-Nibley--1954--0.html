is more like the primitive Church, for better or worse;
(b) "time vindicates the prophets"; and, (c) other
churches have peculiar histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Foreword, R. Douglas Philips writes about the
task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nibley] shows how prophets were replaced by
scholars, revelation by philosophy, inspired
preaching by rhetoric; how the testimony of the
Holy Ghost was replaced by a self-induced mystical
experience, and how for the spiritual gifts and
miracles was substituted the magical wonder-making
of the pagans. [p. x-xi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a chapter on "A Prophet's Reward":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before considering the test of a true prophet,
we must make clear the fact that a prophet is a
witness, not a reformer. Criticism of the world is
always implicit in a prophet's message of
repentance, but he is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sent for the
purpose of criticizing the world. Men know the
world is wicked, and the wickedest ones often know
it best. To denounce human folly has been the
avocation of teachers and philosophers in every
age, and their reward, surprisingly enough, has
not been death but usually a rather handsome
fee. [...] It was not for their moral tirades that
the prophets of old and the Apostles were
stoned. [...] It was as witnesses endowed with
power from on high that they earned the hatred of
the world, [p. 13-14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley has interesting section on how Muhammad was very
anxious about where his visions came from and thought they
might come from the devil. Joseph Smith, on the other
hand, was certain of their divine origin. [p. 22]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nibley quotes Eduard Meyer on the writing style of
Ezekiel, which Meyer shows great disdain for, as well as
the Book of *REDACTED*. (Interesting, Harold Bloom makes a
similar comment in &lt;cite&gt;Jesus and Yahweh&lt;/cite&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The prophetic apparatus has sunk to the most
literal form. Ezekiel is a literary
hack-worker. He does not work through the living
word such as Isaiah and Jermieah struggled to
bring out the depths of the soul, but simply reels
off the contents of a book which he is supposed to
have swallowed in a vision... Ezekiel is
narrow-minded, cramped, without sweep or power,
devoid of any creative imagination, and hence
marked by unendurable pedantry and monotony."
[p. 24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of election and calling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latter-day Saints have always maintained
that guidance both in doctrinal and
administrational matters can come to the church
only by revelation. We couldn't ask for a better
case to prove it than that of St. Augustine,
precisely because he is such a good and great
man. The better man he is, the better he
illustrates the point, which is that &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;
man, no matter how good, wise, hard-working,
devoted, and well-educated he may be, can give us
certainty without revelation. In Father Bligh's
opinion, time has not vindicated Augustine's
opinions. It has shown that we can trust only the
prophets. [p. 97]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My *REDACTED*ertarian alarm went off reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter denying the validity of interpretation of
his words. (p. 28)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The search for God not being very
Christian. (p. 54)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Augustine's reason for not joining the Church
in youth was the doctrine of God being corporeal,
showing that this was an early
revelation. (p. 94)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution is a bad theory, not because it is
wrong, but because its adherents apply to every single
situation and absolve themselves of the responsibility
to do basic research. Nibley discusses this in the
context of church organization, which he says started
fully formed. (p. 129) I would, however, refer to
Bushman's &lt;cite&gt;Rough Stone Rolling&lt;/cite&gt;, which
discusses the development of the structure in
latter days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious activity is interesting, because it does
not have any purpose (in the shallow sense.)
(p. 146)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Scripture consists not in what one reads, but in
what one understands." - St. Hilary (p. 202)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our time on Earth is like showing up late to a
play and leaving early, but being expected to act
intelligently. (p. 268-269)&lt;/li&gt;
