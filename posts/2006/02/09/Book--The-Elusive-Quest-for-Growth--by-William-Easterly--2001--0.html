&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as various claims to have found the elixir of life proved groundless, we economists have too often peddled formulas that violated the basic principle of economics. The problem was not the failure of economics, but the failure to apply the principles of economics in practical policy work. What is the basic principle of economics? As a wise elder once told me, "People do what they get paid to do; what they don't get paid to do, they don't do." A wonderful book by Steven Lansburg, &lt;cite&gt;The Armchair Economist&lt;/cite&gt;, distills the principle more concisely: "People response to incentives; all the rest is commentary." [p. xii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easterly goes through a variety of the schemes that have been attempted by economists over time and debunks them. It is very entertaining, while being depressing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Incentives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clue as to why education is worth little more than hula hoops to a society that wants to grow comes from what the educated people are doing with their skills. In an economy with extensive government intervention, the activity with the highest returns to skills might be lobbying the government or favors. [p. 82]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash for Condoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders of cash for condoms might say that poor families cannot afford condoms, a splendid bit of illogic, since an unwanted child is far more expensive than a condom. Condoms can be purchased internationally for about thirty-three cents apiece. The price of a condom is really a minor factor compared to the other incentives and disincentives to have a child. [p. 90]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt Relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate sign of failure of adjustment lending is to admit that the debts cannot be repaid because it shows that the money was not used productively. The international institutions indeed came to such an admission, as the next chapter discusses. [p. 120]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have been looking at irresponsible behavior from the viewpoint of the borrower. However, someone had to be willing to lend to these irresponsible borrowers. Was there irresponsible lending as well as irresponsible borrowing? I think you can guess the answer. [p. 131]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corruption and Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often we have treated government as if it were some beneficent agent that we could advise on how to benefit the public weal. The knowledge that governments are often corrupt gives pause to such an attitude. Knowing that governments are corrupt, we should be cautious about relying on them to do interventions on behalf of growth. For example, we wouldn't want to recommend industrial policies that subsidize certain sunrise industries, because governments are likely to take payments when they decide whose sunrise to subsidize. The best course would be to eliminate government's discretionary power over household and businesses as much as possible and set up hard and fast rules of the game for government operation. Too long we have ignored corruption on the quest for growth. [p. 252]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
