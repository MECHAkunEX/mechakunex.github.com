Dany's plan seems good (although we'll see at the end of the
episode, that she should have destroyed Euron's fleet with her
dragons first.)

The Grey Worm sex scene was very sweet.

Randall Tarly coming back is a great example of GoT twisting the
knife... we love Sam and hate Cersei, so it will be said to see
Sam on the other side from his father. It was interesting to hear
Cersei describe Dany, because she's literally true but we see
Dany's actions totally differently.

Petyr is so dangerous, and Jon choking him is reminiscent of the
same thing happening with Ned before he dies... I feel like he's
going to get Sansa to do something really stupid while Jon is
away. Sansa cares a lot about the independence of the North,
while Jon just wants to defend the Realms of Men. I think this
will be a big conflict between them.

Arya's reuniting with Nymeria was awesome, although it would have
been even better if she got a new companion. Her conversation
with Hot Pie was great too.

I love that Sam is going to save Jorah. It's so fun when
characters from different storylines meet up.

Yara's defeat was very surprising. Whenever two named characters
from opposing sides are on screen... you know nothing good will
happen. I think on one hand though it is predicable, because
there is more drama is Dany has some loses.

I kind of cannot believe that Theon would be so cowardly.     </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
