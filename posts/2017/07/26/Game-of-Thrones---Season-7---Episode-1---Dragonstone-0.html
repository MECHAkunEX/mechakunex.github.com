The second Walder appeared, I knew
exactly hat was going to happen and it was so epic. Later, when
we see her with the Lannister soldiers, you can tell that she is
ready to kill every single one of them, but then realizes they
are just poor people forced to do it. It is very sad and sweet.

I'm excited about the Hound hanging out with Tormund!

Jon's plans for securing the North are so awesome. (Especially
assigning Tormund to the Wall.) I love that all the kids and
women will be conscripted. It really shows how seriously he takes
it all. I love the idea that the fate of the world and
responsibility is on all these children, and this is shown
excellently by having the Umber and Karstark children take
oaths... they must be really grateful.

You can tell that Baelish is going to do something really bad
though.

I assume that we are seeing undead Giants, because they will be
very effective at attacking the Wall.

I love that Bran has seen Ned and clearly knows a lot about the
other people in the world from his visions.

Cersei's map and the subtle reason for its creation is great. Now
that she's unrestrained... I think she's going to be doing some
horrible things. Although, when she turns to drink in the middle
of the scene, you can tell that she is trying to hide from her
responsibility. Her delusions about her enemies are intense.

Euron's speech is so ridiculous.

I loved Sam's sequence... it was so excellently shot and epicly
done. The Archmaester's dismissal of Sam's concerns are so lame
but it makes sense given his perspective.

Daenerys's scene was cool, because Dragonstone looks so cool, but
I do wish we heard more from her.
