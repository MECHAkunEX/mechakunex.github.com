inscrutable or don't work. The biggest thing is that company is
obviously evil and no one ever seems to notice or care, at least
any of the main characters.

For example, it is very unclear what is going on with Annie. Given
her outburst at the big meeting Mae goes to and how stressed out
she is about Mae being transparent, you think that maybe she is
opposed to The Circle, but it turns out that we were meant to just
see her as stressed out from work (this is confirmed by looking at
a book synopsis.)

Another example is the weird ending, Mae clearly "takes down" the
current leaders of the company, but then seems to be still all in
for the transparent world-view, which suggests that she is somehow
in charge or more influential or something. The book seems much
more disturbing on how she thinks.

This quote from Mick LaSalle is great, "What makes The Circle so
valuable is not only that itâ€™s showing us a ghastly possible path
that the world may take, but that it articulates the mentality that
could create and sustain it." The idea that rather than being a
morality play, the characters believe what they're saying, but we
aren't supposed to, is a nice way to look at this messed up world.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2017/">2017</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
