I feel like Jon was
awesome and Dany was less than great, but it was great when she
apologized. It was especially good for Tyrion and Jon to catch
up. It was very provocative what Melissandre said! It was awesome
when the dragons flew by!

I think that Yara's men won't care about Theon and probably won't
care about Dany... at best they will want revenge but that
doesn't seem to motivate the Ironborn much.

Euron is so gross, but in a hilarious way. Cersei's way of
dealing with the Martells was so brutal. I was surprised to see
the Iron Bank come, but it was cool.

Sansa was doing a great job and I'm impressed by how good
Littlefinger's advice was. It was awesome to have Bran back and
interesting that he immediately answered the question on my mind,
that he should be the Lord of Winterfell. I'm a bit disappointed
he didn't do anything more and that we didn't see Meera in a new
outfit like we saw Bran.

It's sad that Sam and Jorah didn't talk about the White Walkers,
because when Jorah goes back to Dany it would be useful for him
to support Jon.

The Unsullied, and by extension Dany, are doing really
terribly. The Tyrell's situation made it so much worse. It's sad
how badly Dany is being trounced when it comes to strategy. She's
been so dominant and confident, so she can't deal with a good
threat.

Jaime and Olenna's conversation was great.

I've decided that it would be a bad idea for Arya to travel
north, because all she'll do is talk to her family and then
immediately have to travel all the way back south. She's the best
weapon of the Starks against Cersei, when they will otherwise be
facing the White Walkers. I suppose she could be a good support
against Littlefinger when he inevitably betrays them.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
