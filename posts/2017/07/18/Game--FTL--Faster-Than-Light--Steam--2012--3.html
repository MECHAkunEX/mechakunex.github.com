Sector   1: Shields 2, Engines 4, Medbay 2
Sector 2-4: Doors, Drones
Sector 5-7: Shields 3, Engines 5, All 2

I am almost at the end and I am doing really well. I got quite a
few good weapon upgrades. I really like having many different
weapons shooting at the same time. I have high hopes for this run.

I went up against the leader and was totally destroyed. My pilot
area was hacked and on fire, so I couldn't escape. He died and
then it was really down hill after that. Ouch. I guess I'll try
again.

I did a few experiments with things like boarding and cloaking,
but couldn't use them very well. It was frustrating.

--

I won my first two rounds with the big ship but died after
that. It was a bummer. I think I wasted a repair cycle. I did it
again and this time I had a Hull Repair drone. I think that made
all the difference, because I never deployed my drones except for
that and a Systems Repair one. This made it so I could heal during
battle and I did it! Woo!

I can see why this was such a huge hit, but I feel like a lot of
the complicated stuff, like Cloaking and micro-management of where
your characters are is not my cup of tea. Then, what is left is
pretty funny, but also a bit too much of "stand around waiting
until something happens". I feel like a more efficient
(i.e. turn-based) version of the game would be more obviously less
interesting, almost like a clicker.
