plotting was very bad. Newt is kind of interesting but has very
little personality and just seems to stumble from one activity to
the next. He doesn't have a lot of agency or guts in his story.

The most interesting part of the movie is how much it reveals about
what Rowling thinks of Americans. We are really terrible. The
government is much more heavy handed. The ideas about racism are
really weird in the American context, because the British wizarding
community is just as biased against Muggles. It's strange too that
the President is a black woman. This seems to suggest the wizards
are especially progressive, except that they definitely aren't
because of the anti-Muggle idea. It's a very confused plot point
that doesn't work well.

The racism of Rowling, however, is very revealing. The goblins are
Jews in Europe, but in American they are Italians.

The real problem with this movie is that there is no purpose to
it. The massive repair effort and memory wipes ensure that there's
no effect on the future. There's not even much growth in the
outlook of either the wizards or even Newt. He doesn't seem to have
gained confidence and the mild emotional connection is pretty
weak. It was a big let down of a movie.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2016/">2016</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
