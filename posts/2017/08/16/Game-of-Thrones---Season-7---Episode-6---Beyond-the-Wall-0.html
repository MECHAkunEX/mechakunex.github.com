As if the last episode wasn't crazy enough. Yikes!

I liked the wandering scenes where everyone just got cozy with
each other and talked more. It was cute. The conversation with
Dany and Tyrion was really tense... it is interesting how she
really doesn't trust him but we totally do.

The capture of the wight was very interesting, because we now
know that a particular Walker controls a particular set of
wights. The fight was cool and the stand-off on the island was
really intense.

It was totally epic how Dany came in and saved them. As soon as
the Night King got out his spear, I immediately said, "Oh no,
zombie dragon!" It was so cool how Dany and Jon looked at each
other in the moment he sent her off. I couldn't believe that Jon
was really gone, so it made sense for Benjen to be the
deus-ex-machina.

It was really touching the way Dany wanted to wait for Jon, how
she took care of him, and saw his stab wounds. Emilia Clarke did
an amazing job communicating her love in those scenes.

I am very scared about the zombie dragon!

All the scenes with Arya and Sansa were extremely tense. I feel
like both of them are on the verge of doing something really
stupid, and Sansa has no idea just how powerful Arya is.

---

My prediction for the remaining episodes: (7) Figure out how to
meet with Cersei and catch-up on the other plot lines; (8) Have
the meeting with Cersei, she betrays them; (9) Dany crushes
Cersei; (10) The Night King attacks with the Zombie Dragon,
potentially shattering the Wall.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
