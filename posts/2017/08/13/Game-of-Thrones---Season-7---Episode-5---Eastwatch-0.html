There were some really tense moments in this episode!

I like Bronn's explanation to Jaime that he saved him so he could
get rewarded, that strikes me as very much Bronn's style.

I don't think that Dany's offer to the soldiers is very wise,
given that they are unlikely to be loyal if their choice is
fealty or death. It was intense the way she burned them alive...
I wonder what we are meant to believe that the Lannister soldiers
will now do for her.

It is cool that Drogon lets Jon pet him. I feel like it must be
because he's really a Targaryen. I felt like Dany and Jon liked
each when they were departing. It was quite cute. I thought it
was odd that we never saw Theon or got an update on the Greyjoys.

I liked Jaime's practicality and I thought he was very wise. I
think that Cersei is not really pregnant and that she's trying to
manipulate Jaime. I'm surprised that the Mountain wasn't in the
episode.

I thought that it was slightly surprising that Bronn wouldn't
just switch sides and be with Tyrion, given that he doesn't think
that they can stand against dragons.

It was cool the way that Bran warged into a ton of ravens, but it
didn't really seem necessary. My brother-in-law suggested that
Bran will warg into the dragons to take them over later. I'm glad
that he has done something "useful" for the cause, even it was
just warning about the march.

Littlefinger's scheming is very sinister and I think it will
turn out to be very bad for Arya to have come back rather than
gone on to King's Landing. I think that Littlefinger wants Arya
to believe that he was doing Sansa's work, but my immediate
assumption was that he was not really doing that.

It was neat to have Gendry back and his hammer was awesome. (I
recall that his father also used a hammer.) I find it slightly
hard to believe that he's been training in fighting though. I
wonder how Dany would feel about him, given what King Robert did
to her family. I wonder if he will become the new Lord
Baratheon. It's funny that their fathers "fought together" given
that Robert killed Rhaegar.

The scene in the North with everyone in the cell was really
great. It's so the style of this show for everyone to have tons
of weird connections and most of the time they never really talk
about them. (Like Jorah being healed by Sam, if he told Jon that
it would have been good, same with if Dany told him that she
killed Sam's kin.)

I think the Wight hunt is a really bad idea. I don't feel like it
is going to be that useful, because they can easily just crush
Cersei anyways. Plus I think there is a major risk that the Wight
will be able to infect others or something and get loose.

The situation in Oldtown was very depressing. I wonder if Sam
will actually learn anything with the scrolls and books he
stole. It was really interesting to learn that Jon is actually
the true born heir, although it seems like no one can ever know,
except for maybe Bran. I like that Sam quotes his father. It's
funny that Sam ignores Gilly on such an important thing too.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
