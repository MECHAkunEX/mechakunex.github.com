That was SO amazing. Wow. My heart was RACING at the end. It
was crazy.

The scene with Littlefinger and Bran was pretty intense, because
Bran is acting so weird. You want him to rally up and save his
family, but he doesn't seem to be doing anything with his
power. I was particularly saddened by how he treated Meera. I
almost expected him to say that he didn't "need" her but "wanted"
her there. But, no.

It was poetic how Arya had a hard time getting back in, just like
when she tried to get into King's Landing so long ago. Talking
about "her list" was very cool. I get the feeling that Bran wants
Arya to go back to kill Cersei... I certainly do. There's very
little for her to do up here. I think it was unwise for her to
reveal that she was a ninja, especially in the presence of
Littlefinger.

It is interesting that Cersei is considering hiring the Golden
Company, because they worked for Stannis, right?

The conversations between Jon and Dany were awesome. I get the
feeling they are starting to like each other, which would be so
perfect because they are both Targaryens and are both among the
only good people in the show. It was very cute when Davos said
he'd switch sides and join Dany.

Urggh... Theon. Argh...

The fight at the end was so amazing. I loved the terror in the
Lannister troops' eyes. I loved the way that the Dothraki were
just so much better---the guy's comment, "Your people can't
fight." Yikes. The dragon blasts were incredible. The fear and
nervousness was amazing. I think they did a great job when Bronne
was stumbling around, you really felt like one of the soldiers
with no idea what was happening or where to turn. The way that
the burned soldiers are instantly ash right in front of their
eyes... wow. I was very nervous when Dany was about to be
hit. From the perspective of Dany, this is the best result
though, because she now knows that there is some offensive that
is possible and so she can prepare better for it.

The very final moments... wow. It was especially beautiful to
have Tyrion wish Jaime safety.

In reading the wiki, I realize that Gendry's actor is listed as
starring... so he's coming back this season! Wow!

It was interesting that Bronne didn't go after his gold and run,
but stayed and fought. It is particularly interesting, because he
is kind of loyal to people on all the sides: Tyrion, Jaime, and
Poddrick.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
