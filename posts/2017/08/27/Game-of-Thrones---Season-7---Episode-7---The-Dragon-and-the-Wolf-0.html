He
motivates so many of the characters and actions.

I was very nervous about Qyburn taking the wight hand.

Bran: I'm the three eyed raven.
Sam: Ooooooh... I don't know what that means.

I really thought Cersei was going to kill Jaime.  I am very
curious about how they will receive Jaime in the North: Jaime to
Bran, "I'm sorry I pushed you out the window." Bran, "You looked
great when Locke cut off your hand."

Speaking of Bran, he did help against Littlefinger's
"prosecution", but he really has not been that useful so far.

I really liked how proud the Hound seemed of Arya.

I am nervous that Tyrion offered Cersei something, but then again
it could also just be that it was part of Cersei's plan to trick
Dany.

The Night King on dragonback was intense. Yikes.

Predictions: Season 8 won't end with a lot of time spent
post-trauma in the glorious rule of Dany... half an episode at
most, but probably much less. I also think that it would be bad
to have something like three dedicated to the Night King and
three dedicated to Cersei afterwards, so my suspicion is that
both threats will be dealt with at the same time. How could that
happen? Maybe Jaime goes North, talks to the crew, and then The
Hound and Arya go south to kill Cersei, but get into hyjinks
along the way. I think the big questions are...
- How many dragons are left at the end? I assume that Dany &amp; Jon
have an airborne dragon fight with the Night King and two of
them (the dragons) kill each other.
- Will Jon and Dany marry? How will they react to The News? I
think the worst thing would be for them to decide to get
married in Episode 1 and then learn the news in Episode 2 and
then Jon doesn't want to marry because of honors but Dany
doesn't care, so they have some conflict over that.
- Who ends up ruling Westeros? I assume that the Targaryens win,
but there's a conflict between Jon and Dany over this. Jon
definitely won't care about being heir and doesn't want to be
king. Dany will be pissed about it, but not at Jon, instead
she'll be pissed about how it makes people question her and use
it as ammunition against her reign. In the end, it won't matter
because Jon will die in the battle for the living. On the other
hand, maybe Dany dies in child-birth?
- Will Bran do anything useful or awesome with his powers? I
highly doubt it, but it would be cool if he did. I like the "he
is the Night King" theory, but I don't think it will be true.

I like the idea the Cersei knew Tyrion knows she won't help,
because she calls Jaime the stupidest Lannister.

I like the idea that Tyrion is worried about Jon and Dany because
their child might not be a good king.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
