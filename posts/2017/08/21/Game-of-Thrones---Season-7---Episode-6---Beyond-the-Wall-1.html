helping their father either. I love the idea of talking to Lyanna
about this because she is so clearly tougher. I'm not sure
exactly why Sansa sends Brienne away... perhaps because she's
going to attack Arya? Doesn't seem like a good idea. It's sad
that they don't just talk to each other about how Littlefinger is
involved.

It was very cute to have Dany compare Jon with her other
"lovers".

All the little conversations were a lot of fun. I think one of my
favorites was when Tormund talked about Brienne and then when Jon
and Beric talk about how Jon "doesn't look like his father, but
rather his mother." How right he is!

I think that the guys on the island did not do a very good job
preparing defenses. I would have set a watch, bashed the ice
away, and done other things to fortify themselves.

I wonder how the wiki people know it was Viserion that died?

When Dany is talking about children, and how "we" will fight
together, and so on, you almost feel like she is about to
propose. I love that Jon's first thought is to apologies and feel
bad for her, despite how much he just went through.

I like that Jorah has redeemed his honor in a way that his
father would so obviously approve of: defending the Wall against
the army of the dead.

I like the inclusion of the Wight Bear, because it sets up the
zombie dragon. I wonder if it will shoot ice?

It is really useful to know that it is good to kill White Walkers
directly.

Woah! The Night King was in this place!

Yikes, I didn't realize there would only be seven episodes! I
thought it was 10 vs 12 or 13! I'm very sad now.

Dany foreshadowing about heroes doing stupid things...!</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
