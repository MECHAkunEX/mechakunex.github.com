I think it is brilliant and extremely compelling. It is very interesting to compare this book to &lt;cite&gt;Preach My Gospel&lt;/cite&gt; and modern missionary tracts. In modern terms, it essentially starts from the miracles in the scriptures (including mentioning the Nephites without any explanation or notice how jarring this reference should be), the Great Apostasy, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; brief mention of Joseph Smith (his name only appears once in the text and once in a footnote; in fact, there are many times where revelations and visions are referenced without reference to his name), and a discussion of resurrection, exaltation and plural marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to think this structure is marvelous and persuasive, but I can very easily see how the modern Church's approach is more effective. (There is also the obvious problem of dwelling on and defending plural marriage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Pratt talks about the progress present in the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While every science, every art is being developed; while the mind is awakened to new thought; while the windows of heaven are opened, as it were, and the profound depths of human intellect are stirred, moved from the foundation of all other subjects, religious knowledge seems at a standstill. [p. xi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his very first chapter, Pratt recounts virtually every miracle in the scripture as being "by this same power" or "by this very same science", meaning Theology, that he will discourse about in the book. This is a very rhetorically powerful method of connecting the reader to these miracles and see Pratt as a kind of miracle worker teacher. The message: This is a very empowering instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the creation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Royal planter now descends from yonder world of older date, and bearing in his hand the choice seeds of the older Paradise, he plants them in the virgin soil of a new-born earth. They grow and flourish there, and bearing seed replant themselves, and thus clothe the naked earth with scenes of beauty, and fill the air with fragrant incense. Ripening fruits and herbs at length abound. When lo! from yonder world is transferred every species of animal life: Male and female they come, with blessings on their heads; and a voice is heard again, 'Be fruitful and multiply.' Earth--its mineral, vegetable and animal wealth--its Paradise prepared, down comes from yonder world on high, a son of God, with his beloved spouse. And thus a colony from heaven it may be from the sun, is transplanted to our soil. The blessings of their Father are upon them, and the first great law of heaven and earth is again repeated, 'Be fruitful and multiply.' [p. 49--50]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pratt is very clever when talking the apostasy in the European theater. Listen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise time of the discontinuance of these powers [meaning Theology] on the eastern continents, or in the Roman world, is not known. Suffice it to say, the last of the Apostles [John], predicted, in his vision on the Isle of Patmos [Revelation], the reign of a certain power which should make war with the Saints, overcome them, be drunken with their blood and bear rule over all nations. "And by thy sorceries," said he, "Were all nations deceived." If these predictions have had their fulfillment, then it is the height of inconsistency for any one to contend that Rome or any nation has perpetuated the Priesthood, Apostleship or Church. This would be the same as to say the Saints were destroyed and yet perpetuated; all nations were deceived, and yet had the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could a universal or catholic power at once destroy the Saints and perpetuate them? Could the same power, at the same time, be the conservator and promulgator of a system of universal salvation and of universal deception? [p. 71--72]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the recurring mention of Rome and the use of &lt;em&gt;catholic&lt;/em&gt;, which of course means &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt;. Genius. He never says it, but he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Pratt talks about Joseph Smith, he doesn't mention the First Vision at all, he goes right to Moroni. I've, of course, heard that it didn't gain popularity until Joseph F. Smith, but this is first real evidence I've seen first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of baptism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate is now initiated into the first principles of the science of divine Theology. His mind is quickened, his intellectual faculties are aroused to intense activity. He is, as it were, illuminated. He learns more of divine truth in a few days than he could have learned in a lifetime in the best merely human institutions in the world. [p. 99]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miracles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the popular errors of modern times an opinion prevails that miracles are events which transpire contrary to the laws of nature, that they are effects without a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If such is the fact, then, there never has been a miracle, and there never will be one. The laws of nature are the laws of &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;. Truth is unchangeable, and independent in its own sphere. A law of nature never has been broken. And it is an absolute impossibility that such law ever should be broken. [p. 104]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern world, called "Christian," claims to have perpetuated the system called "Christianity," while at the same time it declares that the miraculous gifts of the Spirit have ceased. [p. 112]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner the present generation lose all reverence and respect for modern "Christianity," with all its powerless forms and solemn mockeries, the sooner they will be prepared to receive the Kingdom of God. [p. 113]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussion exaltation, he talks about how being filled with charity and benevolence will inspire eternal praising of God in his heavenly Eden. Then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O candidates for celestial glory! Would your joys be full in the countless years of eternity without forming the connections, the relationships, the kindred ties which concentrate in the domestic circle, and branch forth, and bud and blossom, and bear the fruits of eternal increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that eternal emotion of charity and benevolence which swells your bosoms be satisfied to enjoy in "single blessedness," without an increase of posterity, those exhaustless stores of never ending riches and enjoyments? Or, would you, like your heavenly Father, prompted by eternal benevolence and charity, wish to fill countless millions of worlds with your begotten sons and daughters, and to bring them through all the gradations of progressive being, to inherit immortal bodies and eternal mansions in your several dominions? [p. 169--170]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On plural marriage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It] should be the privilege of every virtuous female, who has the requisite capacity and qualifications for matrimony, to demand, of either individuals or government, the privilege of becoming an honored and legal wife and mother, even if it were necessary for her to be married to a man who has several wives; or, as Jesus said in the parable, to take the one talent from the place where it remains neglected or unimproved, and give it to him who has ten talents. [p. 175--176]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
