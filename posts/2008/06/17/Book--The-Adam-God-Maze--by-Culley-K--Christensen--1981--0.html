are both loaded terms. The goal, by my reading, is to present the
theology in a coherent way, a way that explains how it was
understood during its primacy in LDS Church history and how it can
be understood today. The author is a proponent of the theology, not
an uninvolved bystander, and, as a result, is really making an
&lt;em&gt;apology&lt;/em&gt; for the theology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to learning of the existence of this book, I thought it would
be a good idea to learn a lot about the theology and write a complete
description of it in an attempt to understand the early Church. I
think that Christensen has done a very good job at this, or at least,
he convinces me he has, since I have not read the source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christensen has a very complex relationship with the modern
Church. He seems to believe that the Church is not in error in any
way, except perhaps that some leaders are uneducated with regards to
the past. He seems to think that a belief in Adam-God is perfectly
consistent with membership in the mainstream Church and that all
statements to the contrary by leaders have a double meaning. He does
seem to suggest that the only problem for a modern believer is that
she must not teach it in an official capacity. I'll point to
quotations that reflect this view. I anticipate that many members will
disagree with his interpretations of these comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book to those interested in the subject. If
you are not familiar at least a little with some of the concepts, you
are best to ignore it until you have the time and commitment to follow
everything through. A small taste will likely be sour and cause you to
jump to conclusions. Use your current testimony and let the pattern of
investigation be your guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I have problem with the author's use of the temple
ceremony. Although he only quotes from publicly available sources
(i.e., Smoot) and is within the letter of the covenants, it is still
un-cool. So, boo on him for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culley opens up the book with this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that the controversy [over Adam-God] has been
compounded by attempts to circumvent the issue through denial,
neglect, intimidation or the claim of spuriousness. This approach has
not only fostered ignorance but has perpetuated erroneous
impressions. Furthermore, skirting the issue has proved detrimental,
as *REDACTED* critics have capitalized on this untenable position to cause
embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author feels that the gospel dictates a policy of
forthrightness and open investigation. Furthermore, truth is the
servant of honest inquiry. But, before most members can approach this
subject they must overcome the subliminal taboo against investigating
anything styled as a mystery. It is rather the privilege of Latter-day
Saints to inquire after the mysteries of God. Said Orson Pratt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We should not get into that old sectarian notion, that
we have no right to know anything about this, that or the other, and
that we must not pry into this, that or the other. That is is an old
sectarian notion, which we have fought against all the day long, and
we do not want it to creep into the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. It is the privilege of its members to let their
minds expand, and to ponder upon the things of God, and to enquire of
him, and by and by, when we have prepared ourselves by getting all the
knowledge we possibly can from that which is written, God will give
more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the nature of God, one must inquire what it was that
those early church leaders were trying to teach. And, do their
teachings have current implications? A gospel of truth demands answers
to these questions. [p. 5--6]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author starts with a rhetorical case that revision is necessary
in perfection and exaltation. He points to the development of a
tabernacled God in Church history as an example. Yes, he says, it is
implicit in the First Vision, but it is documented that it was not
wildly known or believed until the Nauvoo period. (p. 23) Similarly,
the plurality of gods and potential of Man is another development that
seemed blasphemous at the time, whereas now it is standard in LDS
thought. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author summarizes the Adam-God doctrine: (A) God our Father is
experiencing and will experience eternal progression. (B) God the
Father merited this in the same way we are attempting. (1) This means
he was once a man like us. (2) He lived a mortal existence analogous
to ours. (3) He obeyed and kept the celestial law. (4) He received an
atonement through a savior. (5) He was resurrected. (6) He assumed His
position in the order of gods. (7) He became a creator. (a) He was
called Michael. (b) His creation includes all mankind and life on this
earth. (c) As Father of our spirits, it is his responsibility to
oversee our progression. (d) Jesus Christ, "you and I" are of the same
spiritual generation and His children. (e) A council between us all
chose Jesus Christ as the Savior. (8) Michael proceeded with the
temporal part of creation. (9) This includes organizing a world and
transplanting life forms from another world. (10) Human life was
transplanted by: (a) Michael became the mortal Adam after being
"prepared" and was placed in the Garden of Eden by His Father. (b)
This preparation included a "veil of forgetfulness". (c) Adam "fell"
from a higher state to a lower. (i) This was to be able to procreate
for his spiritual offspring. (ii) This was caused by partaking of food
of this earth. (iii) Adam and Eve then procreated, bringing life to
this earth as it had been brought to everywhere else. (11) After His
mission was fulfilled, He returned to His former glorified state. (12)
This same father, Adam or Michael, later appeared and fathered Jesus
Christ in the flesh. etc. [paraphrased of p. 25 to 28]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One wonders why step 10, the Fall, was necessary for
procreation if in step 12, Jesus Christ is procreated by the glorified
Michael. This is a question in standard LDS theology, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the remainder of the book is a defense of each of these
points with reference to scripture, the Journal of Discourses, or
Joseph Smith quotes. I'll elide these, except when they are
particularly interesting. The author does not ignore any point listed
above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particular effort is spent explaining that the apparent
inconsistencies in the accounts of the Creation in the scriptures are
due to confusing the spiritual and temporal creations. (p. 40--41)
Other contradictions have to do with Adam speaking with "God" during
the Eden period. The author explains that this is Adam's God, not our
God. That we do not normally refer to our Heavenly Father's Father
does not make Him not exist. (p. 49) Similarly, we are asked to
remember that Joseph Smith was rather vigorous in use of Elohim as a
plural name for the council, rather than a person. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author argues that "The Only Begotten" must be a title that
applies to Jesus in our created earth, but to someone else in the
creation in most of the scriptural accounts. Essentially, there are
causality problems, which he enumerates. (p. 50--51) This is the
beginning of his discussion of how "Jehovah" is not a personal name,
but a signifier of godhood, like a title. His summary is that just as
there are two creations, there are two godheads. (p. 56)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author is rhetorically elegant in drawing a parallel between
Adam's fall and condescension for creation and the sacrifice of
Christ. He points out that Christ's time on earth was necessary (for
His progression), so the sacrifice is more muddied than
Adam's. (Although, Adam is progressing as well, by producing children
and gaining glory.) He also talks about how this view of the Father is
more commensurate with a loving Father who does something Himself,
rather than only sacrificing His Son. (p. 60--61)&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For all of humanity, no greater proof of
love could be offered, no nobler act could be performed. Adam
compassionately stepped down from a celestial throne to voluntarily
offer himself as a blood sacrifice that we might live and grasp the
opportunity to become a god. [p. 62]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an instance of the value the author ascribes to the
theology beyond "truth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Adam die? I thought resurrection meant "no death"? The author
essentially equates death with involuntary separation of body and
spirit, which resurrection affords.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Adam died ---
i.e., was changed from mortality to immortality --- as the scriptures
indicate. But how could he die a second time after having been
resurrected on a previous world? Because he had power over death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the Father hath power in Himself, even so hath the
Son power --- to do what? Why, what the Father did. The answer is
obvious --- in a manner to lay down His body and take it up
again. Jesus, what are you going to do? To lay down my life as my
Father did, and take it up again. (TPJS, p. 346)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Jesus laid down His life just as His Father had done. Jesus
informs us that He could do nothing but what He &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; His
Father do. "The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the
Father do" (John 5:19). When did Jesus see His Father lay down his
life? Certainly not before He (Jesus) was born as a spirit, which was
when Michael died and was resurrected on another world, for the Savior
did not then exist. He (Jesus) could only have seen His Father (Adam)
lay down his life "and take it up again" on our present world (TPJS,
p. 346) [p. 68]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the book shifts to defending the doctrine, first
with emphasis on Brigham Young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author makes a very strong case that Brigham Young and other
church leaders could not have been misquoted. The quotations are
innumerable, over a long period of time, in many different situations,
and they had ample opportunity to correct reports. (p. 95--104)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question is, "Was Brigham Young wrong?" The author says
that there are (1) Adam-God believers and (2) Unbelievers. Of the
unbelievers, there are those who are ignorant and uncommitted. There
are also committed unbelievers. He categorizes their reasons:
(p. 106--130)&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;ol&gt; 

&lt;li&gt;"Brigham Young did not teach the Adam-God but was in fact
misinterpreted, misrepresented or misrecorded." This is clearly not
the case.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Brigham did teach the Adam-God doctrine and was wrong, but
... these teachings were not church doctrine." He points out that this
is irrelevant because what matters is if it is true, not if it is
endorsed and approved. He argues that it was intended to be doctrine,
but that the Church relaxed that requirement. He points out that
plural marriage was not official until 1852, but was certainly true,
holy, and practiced before then&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"[The above...], but he was merely expressing a personal opinion."
He argues from quotations that Brigham did not present the doctrine
this way, but as revealed truth.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"[The above...], but ... he was not acting [as a prophet]." Again,
he argues from quotations that Brigham presented himself as if he
were.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brigham was doing God's will in teaching false doctrine that was
good to have at the time. He argues that this throws water in the face
of the "God of Truth."&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was true then but not true today. He argues that this is
absurd, since God's identity can't changed because people decide not
to believe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brigham taught falsely to separate the wheat and the tares. He
argues that this is implausible, since there was a time when everyone
in the leadership was a believer and people were excommunicated for
not believing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brigham taught falsely and it is a mistake of a man,
understandable in the eyes of God. The author argues against this
fallibility in such important matters and in consideration of the long
tenure of President Young and the length of the teaching of this
doctrine.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author makes clear that he would see a fallout of Brigham
Young's authority as a failure in the entire structure of the Church
today that would unrecoverable. God will not lead his people
astray. (p. 128)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a defense of Brigham, the defense focuses on an argument that
Joseph Smith taught the doctrine---on the basis of quotations of
others testimony about Joseph--and that it has roots in
antiquity---the FARMSian approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, there is no question as to
what Brigham taught relative to Adam being our spiritual and temporal
progenitor. For some, the words of a prophet are conclusive evidence
of truth. [p. 131]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary of the author's argument as to why the Adam-God
theology is not taught today is: This doctrine is a sacred pearl, and
must not be cast before swine, it is available to those who will seek
for it and understand it. The temple points to it, as do many other
veiled references. If it is promoted boldly, then it will be rejected
and ridiculed. The doctrine has been "reclaimed" from the world, which
once ridiculed it as standard fare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;He quotes Spencer W. Kimball in 1976:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We warn you against the dissemination of doctrines
which are not according to the scriptures and which are alleged to
have been taught by some of the General Authorities of past
generations. Such for instance the Adam-God theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We denounce that theory and hope that everyone will be cautioned
against this and other kinds of false doctrines. (Desert News,
Oct. 9, 1976) [p. 184]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;He responds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Kimball's remarks were address to an
"Adam-God theory" ... "which is not found in scripture."  The real
issue, the Adam-God &lt;em&gt;doctrine&lt;/em&gt; as taught by Joseph and Brigham
which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; founded in scripture, was not a consideration in
President Kimball's remarks for, according to this statement, we
should reject all false teachings not founded in scripture. Indeed,
this is the same teaching of Brigham and Joseph. Illusion, however,
was given to those who didn't understand that the church discredits
the Adam-God doctrine. He could only have meant to give the illusion
of discreditation, for there is no possible way the church could
repudiate the restored doctrines of Jesus Christ and maintain its
favor with God. [p. 185]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;He defends this interpretation by quoting many replies to questions
to the First Presidency that have in common the theme of "don't cast
this pearl before swine; it is true, but don't teach it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has a chapter (#15) arguing that Jesus Christ is not the
Jehovah of the Old Testament, but Adam is, and showing that this was
the common doctrine of the Church before the turn of the century and
the passing by of the Adam-God theology. He also discusses how such a
belief fills a void left empty by the removal of the Adam-God
theology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final chapter reaffirms the author's testimony of Jesus Christ
as our atoning Savior. I thought this was very wise given that a lot
of the book seems to argue against Jesus' supremacy and station. The
author's message is: just because Jesus doesn't fulfill every role in
the scriptures and just because He is below Adam or our Heavenly
Father, doesn't mean He isn't important, vital, and the center of the
Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
