There is a particularly introspective aspect of these essays, which I find very interesting. One thing that this book tells me: Bushman was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; holding back his enthusiasm for Joseph Smith and *REDACTED*ism in &lt;cite&gt;Rough Stone Rolling&lt;/cite&gt;. He should be lauded for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On why new histories are rewritten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, written history changes simple because history itself brings change. Were we exactly like our ancestors, their history would satisfy us just as their houses and clothes would. But time has altered our concerns, our beliefs, our values, just as it has changed our taste and technological skill. We need new histories that appeal to our views of causation, our sense of significance, and our moral concerns. [p. 7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He writes about how believers would do history differently and says that it is erroneous to consciously plan on writing "*REDACTED*-style" histories, because that would be shallow. When Marxists write Marxist histories, they really believe it and are not straining themselves. People who are thoroughly *REDACTED* will write *REDACTED* history. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that *REDACTED* faculty's chief responsibility is to emphasize faith, not to suppress doubt. Faith has to overcome doubt not by censoring, but by strengthening itself. ... We have to trust young people to find belief just as their teachers have done. [p. 30]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay, "The Lamanite View of Book of *REDACTED* History", is very profound, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the Lamanite story has nothing to do with their depravity but with the terrible consequences of misunderstanding the past. [p. 92]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few essays, Bushman points out that historians who do not tell the &lt;cite&gt;Book of *REDACTED*&lt;/cite&gt; story with angels and plates, go against the standard historical practice of citing the sources closest to the event. Interesting. (p. 105)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In responding to the Campbell critique of the &lt;cite&gt;Book of *REDACTED*&lt;/cite&gt;, Bushman points out that it was not actually &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to settle theological controversies at the time. (p. 132) This is an interesting aspect of the intriguing fact that the book's content was rarely referred to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bushman records that Nauvoo never had chapels or traditional meeting houses, instead they met in random places and used all their resources for the temple. (p. 186)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bushman places Joseph Smith's relevance in history as an answer to the question, "Do you believe God speaks?" (p. 274)&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2007/">2007</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
