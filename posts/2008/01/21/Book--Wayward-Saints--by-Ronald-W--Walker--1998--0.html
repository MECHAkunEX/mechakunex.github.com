It is very interesting to see the ideas of the group of people responsible for it and where they are today. For example, the authority of Church leaders remains un-changed in form, but not in scope, as the political and economic kingdoms have passed away. I think that Buddhism is the new Spiritualism for modern Godbeites to partake in for additional spiritual experiences that modern *REDACTED*ism does not give. All the other ideas of Godbeites now find their home, in my opinion, in the Sunstone community. Given this and the history of the Godbeite movement, it is not hard to understand why the Church reacted as it did in the early nineties towards Sunstone et al.: Church authorities, whether conscience of it or not, are likely influenced by the official reaction to Godbeites in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thought on this vein: It seems understandable why many members of the Church (and perhaps leaders, as well) would be uncomfortable with Joseph Smith's use of a seer stone in the translation of the Book of *REDACTED* given the prominence of spiritualism in the Godbeite movement and the harshness of Church leaders in their sermons against such spiritualism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing and research of the book is very good, but on occasion there is an inkling that Walker has an agenda. There are many times when he uses psychological speculation to explain an actor's motives, rather than simply relating what happened, when there is no historical record of their own explanation. Similarly, he brings up information in strange places, for example, there is frequent mention and dwelling on the Spiritualist manifestations of the Godbeite crowd, even when all that can be said is that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; didn't mention it. Overall, Walker seems to assume (like many Latter-day Saints) that the only result of disobedience and failure of testimony is worldliness and sin, and he seems to go out of his way to paint the characters in this light whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quotes, etc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrison on the power of *REDACTED*ism in response to claims of its materialism: "Our religion is bound to drag a man through such a chain of circumstances, that everything of ... [a material] kind will be taken from him, until his heart is only set on things that never fade." (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrison on the sealing power:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bands are rotten, who can fasten together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about the binding and the loosing power [of the priesthood]! It rests within ourselves. Jehovah's servants do but stamp and put the seal of office upon it, and make it legal and secure. We must bring to them a prepared document, written in imperishable attachments ...; we must bring them, in fact, something worth the stamping---something that will naturally keep together, or the seal will not be affixed; or, if it is, it will sever the quicker; for that which is unnatural and uncongenial [in marriage] cannot be united or riveted by the power of the holy Priesthood. [p. 27]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker references Young describing that wealth equalization is absurd, because it requires annual review. (p. 85)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrison on Brigham Young: "A man cannot be ordained a Prophet or Seer any more than he can be ordained to be six feet high, or to have red hair. The faculty of Seership and the Prophetic quality are matters of personal organization and must---as in Joseph Smith's case---be born with the man." (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;cite&gt;Keep-A-Pitchin&lt;/cite&gt; on the Godbeites (New Movement): "We learn that the City Fathers design pulling down the recently erected lampposts and substituting a few personages of the New Move[ment]. That's as it should be, The people require light, and while there is so much of it in the Movement, why not utilize it? This new gas does not equal the old in brilliancy, but this is made up in quantity." (p. 243)&lt;/p&gt;
