The ending is very touching and does not have the luke-warm, uncharacteristic ending of many otherwise tragic movies and books---such as &lt;cite&gt;The Breakup&lt;/cite&gt;. Dickens is an amazing writer, as I've been told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some choice moments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning by making mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of action for myself. [p. 72]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why, here's a J," said Joe, "and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. [p. 75]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, "The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want to be a gentleman on her account." Having made this lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?" Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't know," I moodily answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because, if it is to spite her," Biddy pursued, "I should think - but you know best - that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think - but you know best - she was not worth gaining over."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment. &lt;strong&gt;But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire her dreadfully."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot. [p. 156]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection. [p. 253--254]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fete days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her - and they were all miseries to me. I never had one hour's happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death. [p. 319]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures," replied Estella, with a glance towards him, "hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?" [p. 328]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it lasts forever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nonsense," she returned, "nonsense. This will pass in no time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Never, Estella!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since - on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made, are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation I associate you only with the good, and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!" [p. 378]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
