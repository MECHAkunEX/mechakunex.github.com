In this case, actually a few incidents. It covers the various disagreements before Orson Pratt and Joseph Smith (relatively minor actually) and then Brigham Young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief summary: Orson Pratt was surprised by polygamy in Nauvoo and that caused some problems between he and his wife (who later repudiated polygamy [p. 226]) and the Prophet. Orson had problems with forming a new First Presidency and dividing the Quorum. Later, Orson had difficulties with Brigham regarding what is now called Adam-God theology; and, Brigham had difficulties with Orson over some of Orson's speculative cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book does a great job of summarizing these issues and getting to the heart of the disagreements, as well as echoing their severity at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Smith to the Relief Society after the Pratt dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No man lives without fault. Do you think that even Jesus, if he were here would be without fault in your eyes? They said all manner of evil against him---they all watch'd for iniquity... [p. 29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orson Pratt tried to resolve the one-ness of God by saying that we worship, not the person of God, but His qualities or attributes. "A truth is not two truths because it dwells in two or more beings, but we worship it as one truth wherever we find it." (p. 92) He would refer to this "Fullness of Truth" as the God he worshipped. (p. 100) Brigham disagreed with it (p. 138) and said that when we become gods, we would then worship ourselves, which would be absurd. It is curious to consider the nature of our worship in exaltation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding this argument, Orson Hyde said, "My opinion is not worth as much to me as my fellowship in this Church." (p. 146) Hyde later testified that the Lord would not allow the prophet to lead the Church astray. (p. 191) This is much earlier (and unbiased) than Woodruff's similar statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me that the argument between Brigham and Orson started as early as the trail west. I was under the assumption that "Adam-God" statements came later, but Bergera clearly shows them rather early. (p. 95)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument was over Orson saying that because God was omniscient that there was an "end to knowledge" (as Brigham characterized it) and an end of advancement. Brigham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It is] a fals doctrin &amp;amp; not true[,] that there never will be a time in all Eternity when all the Gods of Eternity will scease advancing in power knowledge experience &amp;amp; Glory[,] for if this was the case[,] Eternity wood seease to be &amp;amp; the glory of God would come to an End. But all of [the] celestial beings will continue to advance in knowledge &amp;amp; power worlds without end." (p. 113)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It [is] fals doctrin[e.] For the God[s] &amp;amp; all intelligent Beings would never scease to learn except it was the Sons of perdition[;] they would continue to decrease untill they became dissolved back into their native Element &amp;amp; lost their Identity. [p. 126]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intriguing: it suggests that only the Sons of Perdition cannot progress in Eternity (i.e., eternal progression for all kingdoms). The comment that they dissolve and lose their identity recalls the theology that they can be reconstituted and "given another chance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orson dying epitaph: My body sleeps but a moment; but my testimony lives and shall endure forever. [p. 278]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very interesting to read this book and reflecting on how in many positions that Church has sided more towards Orson than Brigham, as discussed in the closing section. (p. 281--283)&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2002/">2002</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
