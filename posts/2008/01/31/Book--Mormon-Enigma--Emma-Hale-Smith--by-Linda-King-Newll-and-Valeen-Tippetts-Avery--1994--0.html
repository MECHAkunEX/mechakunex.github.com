I find her fascinating and marvelous in her good example. I knew that she was given a bad rap historically, but I didn't know the extent until reading the later chapters of this book. After reading this book, I still find her to be an admirable example for women in the Church, but I still find her baffling. Thus, I think the title of this book is apt; and I will try to elaborate below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, what a commingling of thought filled my mind for the money, again she is here, even in the seventh trouble---undaunted, firm, and unwavering---unchangeable, affectionate Emma! -- Joseph Smith [p. 0]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw a day in the world that I would not almost worship that woman, Emma Smith, if she would be a saint instead of being a devil. -- Brigham Young [p. 0]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Emma's faith in Joseph was remarkable, so was Joseph's faith in Emma. He told her that no one would be allowed to see the plates until they were translated, yet he did not hide them from her. If the plates were a hoax, she could have easily exposed Joseph as an impostor. "I believe he was everything he professed to be," she would say at the age of seventy-four. [p. 25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph on women making clothes and curtains for the Kirtland temple before it was done: "Well, sisters, you are always on hand. Mary was the first at the resurrection; and the sisters now are the first to work on the inside of the temple." (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors go to great lengths to build a case that Emma's "denials" of plural marriage were in line with the practice of Joseph in Nauvoo to deny "marriage", "spiritual wifery", "improper relations", but not the code-words such as "the true order of marriage", the "new and everlasting covenant", etc. I find this persuasive. (p. 292) (p. 301--302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting occurrences: Joseph commanded by Moroni to bring Emma to the hill to collect the plates (p. 19); account of receiving the Word of Wisdom (p. 47); origin of "Hurrah for Israel" (p. 85); "Ask thee to send us something better next time" (p. 85); Emma biting her son's arm for the other (p. 90); account of Joseph designing the Garments of the Priesthood (p. 139); Emma accepts plural marriage and becomes the first woman to receive the Endowment five days later (p. 143); "You do not know Emma as well as I do" (p. 151); Joseph removing his garments before Carthage to prevent ridicule (p. 189); Lewis' infidelity (p. 276).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some perplexing things: (1) Emma opposes Joseph's plural marriage, yet marries Lewis Bidamon a few years after his death (they have no children); (2) I am bothered by Emma's actions, but not Joseph's. (3) Emma opposes Joseph's plural marriage, yet consents to Lewis' infidelity, and encourages him to marry his mistress when she dies; (4) Joseph III opposes and denies plural marriage vehemently, yet marries three women (serially, of course) and has a polygmic seventeen children in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
