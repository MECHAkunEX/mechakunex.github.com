over us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Constitution has no inherent
authority or obligation. It has no authority or obligation at all,
unless as a contract between man and man. And it does not so much
as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It
purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living
eighty years ago. And it can be supposed to have been a contract
then only between persons who had already come to years of
discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonable and obligatory
contracts. Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a small
portion even of the people then existing were consulted on the
subject, or asked, or permitted to express either their consent or
dissent in any formal manner. Those persons, if any, who did give
their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been
dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the constitution,
so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no
natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their
children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of
things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even
attempt to bind them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. At nearly all elections, votes are
given for various candidates for the same office. Those who vote
for the unsuccessful candidates cannot properly be said to have
voted to sustain the Constitution. They may, with more reason, be
supposed to have voted, not to support the Constitution, but
specially to prevent the tyranny which they anticipate the
successful candidate intends to practice upon them under color of
the Constitution; and therefore may reasonably be supposed to have
voted against the Constitution itself. This supposition is the more
reasonable, inasmuch as such voting is the only mode allowed to
them of expressing their dissent to the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ostensible supporters of the
Constitution, like the ostensible supporters of most other
governments, are made up of three classes, viz.: 1. Knaves, a
numerous and active class, who see in the government an instrument
which they can use for their own aggrandizement or wealth. 2. Dupes
--- a large class, no doubt --- each of whom, because he is allowed
one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his own
person and his own property, and because he is permitted to have
the same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others, that
others have in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid
enough to imagine that he is a "free man," a "sovereign"; that this
is "a free government"; "a government of equal rights," "the best
government on earth," and such like absurdities. 3. A class who
have some appreciation of the evils of government, but either do
not see how to get rid of them, or do not choose to so far
sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously
and earnestly to the work of making a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The payment of taxes, being compulsory,
of course furnishes no evidence that any one voluntarily supports
the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. It is true that the theory of our Constitution is, that all
taxes are paid voluntarily; that our government is a mutual
insurance company, voluntarily entered into by the people with each
other; that that each man makes a free and purely voluntary
contract with all others who are parties to the Constitution, to
pay so much money for so much protection, the same as he does with
any other insurance company; and that he is just as free not to be
protected, and not to pay tax, as he is to pay a tax, and be
protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this theory of our government is wholly different from the
practical fact. The fact is that the government, like a highwayman,
says to a man: Your money, or your life." And many, if not most,
taxes are paid under the compulsion of that threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place,
spring upon him from the roadside, and, holding a pistol to his
head, proceed to rifle his pockets. But the robbery is none the
less a robbery on that account; and it is far more dastardly and
shameful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility,
danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has
any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for
your own benefit. He does not pretend to be anything but a
robber. He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to be
merely a "protector," and that he takes men's money against their
will, merely to enable him to "protect" those infatuated
travellers, who feel perfectly able to protect themselves, or do
not appreciate his peculiar system of protection. He is too
sensible a man to make such professions as these. Furthermore,
having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do. He
does not persist in following you on the road, against your will;
assuming to be your rightful "sovereign," on account of the
"protection" he affords you. He does not keep "protecting" you, by
commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do
this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money
as often as he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and
by branding you as a rebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your
country, and shooting you down without mercy, if you dispute his
authority, or resist his demands. He is too much of a gentleman to
be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villanies as
these. In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt
to make you either his dupe or his slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man is none the less a slave because
he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of
years. Neither are a people any the less slaves because permitted
periodically to choose new masters. What makes them slaves is the
fact that they now are, and are always hereafter to be, in the
hands of men whose power over them is, and always is to be,
absolute and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The secret ballot makes a secret
government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and
murderers. Open despotism is better than this. The single despot
stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My
will is law: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my
acts: The only arbiter I acknowledge is the sword: If anyone denies
my right, let him try conclusions with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a secret government is little less than a government of
assassins. Under it, a man knows not who his tyrants are, until
they have struck, and perhaps not then. He may guess, beforehand,
as to some of his immediate neighbors. But he really knows
nothing. The man to whom he would most naturally fly for
protection, may prove an enemy, when the time of trial comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of government we have; and it is the only one
we are likely to have, until men are ready to say: We will consent
to no Constitution, except such an one as we are neither ashamed
nor afraid to sign; and we will authorize no government to do
anything in our name which we are not willing to be personally
responsible for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1870/">1870</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
