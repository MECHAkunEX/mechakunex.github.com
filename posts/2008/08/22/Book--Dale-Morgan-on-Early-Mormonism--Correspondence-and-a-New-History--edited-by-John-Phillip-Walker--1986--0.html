It is very sad
that his accomplishments are rather pointless due to the invention
of the computer and the Internet. It is interesting to read about
the note-card conversations between this deaf man and his
friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the unfinished history, it is very curious that
such a frank non-believer would devout so much of his life to *REDACTED*
history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Palmyra:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A foot of snow had
fallen in June; snow fell even in July and August, at the height of
summer, and a killing frost on September 10 cut down such hardy crops
as had survived. The year 1816 has ever since been remembered as
"eighteen-hundred-and-froze-to-death," and on all the roads that fall,
west across the Green Mountain to the valley of the Hudson and beyond,
dust bellied up in sullen clouds about the wagons of those who, like
the Smiths, had abandoned hope in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Martin Harris visiting Joseph in Harmony, before the translation
began:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For all his brave words, Martin
Harris could not but have been shaken to find in Joseph such little
constancy to the great cause, while he himself was prepared to
mortgage his farm to finance publication of the book. Swift to
retrieve his mistake, Joseph proposed that Harris carry to New York a
sheet of characters transcribed from the golden plates, and secure
opinions on them from the foremost scholars of the day. This was a
means of dealing with his followers Joseph would find useful to the
end of his life. In a perilous situation, set people to doing
something: It kept them occupied, enlisted their loyalties, and served
to identify their interests with his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the document given to *REDACTED*les Anthon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anthon said later that the transcript
brought him by this "plain, and apparently simple-hearted farmer"
consisted of "all kinds of crooked characters disposed in columns, and
had evidently been prepared by some person who had before him at the
time a book containing various alphabets. Greek and Hebrew letters,
crosses and flourishes, Roman letters inverted or placed sideways,
were arranged in perpendicular columns, and the whole ended in a rude
delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with
various strange marks, and evidently copied after the Mexican Calender
by Humboldt." 16 What has been preserved among the Saints as the
"Anthon transcript" does not conform to this description, nor is the
evidence satisfactory that the extant transcript is that which was
taken to Anthon. But there is no reason to suppose that the sheet of
"Caractors" usually referred to as the "Anthon transcript" was not
prepared by Joseph Smith as a representation of the characters found
on the plates, and it may be critically discussed in this light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was very intrigued by this, because I've seen the
"Caractors" transcript many times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the missing pages:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It
has been assumed that the 116 pages Martin Harris lost comprised all
of the manuscript which had been written to that time. That this
assumption is mistaken, that some few pages, at least, had been
written beyond that point, is shown by a revelation of May 1829, which
gave instructions for replacing the lost portion of the manuscript:
"You shall translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi,
down even till you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you
come to that which you have translated, &lt;em&gt;which you have
retained&lt;/em&gt;." The language of this revelation is employed again in
Joseph's special foreward to the first edition of the Book of *REDACTED*:
"The Lord said unto me...thou shalt translate from the plates of
Nephi, &lt;em&gt;until ye come to that which ye have translated, which ye
have retained&lt;/em&gt;." 1 (The italics in each case are mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author's opinion of the Book of *REDACTED*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That no part of the book's conception was
conspicuously original only strengthened its appeal and was strikingly
characteristic of Joseph's subsequent practice in the role of prophet,
seer, and revelator, for the distinguishing feature of Joseph's church
was not to be the novelty of its doctrines but the authority with
which it seized upon the floating ideas of its generation. What gave
Joseph's book vitality, however, was not intellectual content but the
emotional impact which followed from its identification with the
Bible. Joseph had neither the wit nor the learning to write a book
parallel to the Bible which men would be able to receive as being of
equal standing, but he did possess a boundless ingenuity, a certain
plasticity of mind, and a verbal facility which are worthy of all
admiration, whatever the defects of the work they combined to
produce. The Bible gave him both his frame of reference and the warp
into which he wove the blood-and-thunder adventures, platitudinous
moralizing, family memories, revivalist sermons, political alarms,
speculative ethnology, backwoods folklore, and all the other curious
threads which make up the woof of his narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1986/">1986</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
