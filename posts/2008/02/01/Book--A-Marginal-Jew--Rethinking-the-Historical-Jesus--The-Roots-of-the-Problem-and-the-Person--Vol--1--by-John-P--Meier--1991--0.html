I highly
recommend it for anyone interested in the latest scholarly details
about Jesus' life. Meier is very good at separating his Catholicism
from what the historical record supports---and for this reason, the
work is very satisfactory for a *REDACTED*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing the difficulty of finding data, Meier writes, "As
hard as it is for the devout Christian to accept, the fact is that
Jesus was simply insignificant to national and world history as seen
through the eyes of Jewish and pagan historians of the 1st and early
2nd centuries A.D. If he was seen at all, it was a the periphery of
their vision" (p. 7--8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In defining the "historical" Jesus, he contrasts with the "real"
Jesus and says: "The reader who wants to know the real Jesus should
close this book right now, because the historical Jesus is neither the
real Jesus nor the easy way to him. The real Jesus is not available
and never will be. This is true not because Jesus did not exist---he
certainly did---but rather because the sources that have survived do
not and never intended to record all or even most of the words and
deeds of his public ministry---to say nothing of the rest of his
life." (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing how Paul rarely quotes Jesus, and only to bring to
mind basic doctrine, Meier writes: "For all his claims to apostolic
authority, Paul does not feel free to create teachings and put them
into the mouth of Jesus. We might ask: Who in the first generation
did?" (p. 46) He also mentions that the use Paul does put to Jesus'
words is remarkable in that it provides evidence for the coverage of
that doctrine (Rome) by others than Paul. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meier superbly summarizes the issues revolving around the mentions
of Jesus by Josephus. (Chapter 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly anti-female part of the Gospel of Thomas:
saying 114. (p. 127) On the subject of Gnostics, I was thinking: Why
would people believe that Jesus &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; teaching some secret
doctrine? As a *REDACTED*, I naturally think that he was teaching (and
giving) the Endowment. Those in contact with the disciples knew that
there was this secret teaching, but no one knew what it was. The
gnostics got converts by purporting to have received it and being
willing to reveal it. Obviously this is pure speculation, but it is a
natural way of explaining something rather difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing the various criteria for determining if a saying of
Jesus is legitimate, Meier introduces the criterion of embarrassment:
something that undermines Jesus is probably true, because it would be
fruitless to make it up. This is "Stone in the Hat"-style things. His
prime example is Jesus' baptism. Interestingly, in the discussion he
talks about our sensibilities are very different than those at the
time. In particular, the "cry of dereliction" would not be considered
as anything embarrassing. (p. 168--170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A Jesus whose words and deed would not alienate people,
especially powerful people, is not the historical Jesus."
(p. 177)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What ... is the usefulness of the historical Jesus to people of
faith? My reply is: none", Meier writes. He goes on to say the study
is important for "faith seeking understanding." (p. 198) A historical
Jesus prevents thinking of Christianity as purely myth based, losing
the humanity of Christ, "domesticating" Christ, and exalting him into
some insane political revolutionary. (p. 199)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The more we appreciate what Jesus meant in his own time
and place, the more `alien' he will seem to us" (p. 200)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of Jesus' language and education is also
fascinating. (Chapter 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thus, while Jesus was in one sense a common Palestinian workman,
he plied a trade that involved, for the ancient world, a fair level of
technical skill. It also involved no little sweat and muscle
power. The airy weakling often presented to us in pious paintings and
Hollywood movies would hardly have survived the rigors of being
Nazareth's tekton from his youth to his early thirties." (p. 281)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meier is pretty strongly in support that the "brothers and sisters"
of Jesus are true, natural brothers and sisters. He is entertaining in
his assault on the other theories. (Chapter 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Meier's treatment of Jesus' celibacy is pretty weak. He use
techniques that he criticizes in others. The most impressive argument
is that when Jesus' family is mentioned, there is no mention of a wife
or children. The main mention is at the synagogue and there is nothing
"shameful" about having a wife, like there is about declaring
authority when you are "just the local woodworker." Meier fails to
point this out, when earlier he makes a great hurrah about the
rhetorical content of the synagogue event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chapter of the book is a very rigorous study of the
chronology of Jesus' life. The money quote: "Some theologians naively
equate divine inspiration with inerrancy in the smallest historical
and geographical details." (p. 390) Some points: Barrabas (if real)
would be released for the purpose of celebrating the Passover, not
after the Passover (p. 400); and, the Jewish month was based on
observations, rather than facts, complicating the use of modern
science to determine what they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; the date was
(p. 401)&lt;/p&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1991/">1991</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
