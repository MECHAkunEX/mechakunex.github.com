respects to Israel and the Jewish people. The author describes two
traditions: the first is associated with Oliver Cowdery and Sidney
Rigdon and is inherited from the traditional Christian anti-Jewish
sentiment; that they are "Christ-killers" and have lost their
reward. The second is due to Joseph Smith and assures Israel that
the covenants of God remain valid. Joseph Smith did not encourage
proselytizing to Jews and integrated a great deal of Jewish
institutions and ideas into an otherwise Christian church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summarizing these ideas, Epperson describes Joseph's emphasis as
on the Lord rather than the Church:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith's use of the good shepherd of the parable remained more
humble, more realistic, and perhaps more akin to its source. It was
not the church but the Lord who would reign. [p. 67]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epperson quotes Joseph to Orson Hyde (p. 145) regarding his visit
to Jerusalem. Joseph informs him to only preach basic principles. I
think most people use this quote out of context in "milk vs. meat"
arguments, etc; but Epperson interprets it in context under the rubric
of Joseph's anti-proselytizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epperson argues that Brigham Young primarily continued the Smith
doctrine (while Orson Pratt and others continued the traditional) and
places a great deal of emphasis on his suggestion that in the
Millennium there will be many sects and opinions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the ever-realistic Young believed that after
bowing the knee and tripping the tongue in confession, people would
yet "worship the sun, moon, a white dog, or anything else they
please." [p. 199]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epperson interprets these many
remarks as indicative of Brigham's "eschatological pluralism." I think
Brigham is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying that variant worship, sects, etc. will
be okay or approved by God, merely that God will not deny these people
their agency and that even true, first-hand knowledge of God will not
convince them to accept His gospel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the epilogue, Epperson discusses when Brigham and Joseph speak
against the Jews. He summarizes that the charges they bring against
them are never about rejecting Jesus or being "Christ-killers", but
that they broke the covenant in other ways, particularly related to
imitation or accommodation of non-covenant cultures. [p. 217]&lt;/p&gt;
