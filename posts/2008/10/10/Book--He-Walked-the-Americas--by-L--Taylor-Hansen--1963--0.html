The paper weight is very heavy,
the font is beautiful, there are amazing woodcuts on every single
page... wow. Not sure if the one on Amazon is the same way, I've
got a 2nd printing edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book chronicles the story of an "unknown prophet" in the
Americas by going over stories passed down by Native American
stories, songs, chants, etc. This prophet developed into
Quetzalcoatl and other deities, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story starts in Polynesia as Wakea (as he is called) comes
from the West and teaches the people peace before traveling with
them to South America. (p. 18) In Peru, the "Pale One" said he had
to go and teach people in the jungle to stop their warfare and
sacrifices. (p. 23) In Mexico, the story talks about what kinds of
books he read from the sages... very interesting given that the
Spanish destroyed all the books. (p. 31) The Algonkin asked him his
name from childhood and he said it was "Chee-Zoos". (p. 53)
Obviously, the pale prophet was a white man... the longest
description is on page 68 from the Michigan tribe's story. The
Navaho report he told them the name of 'His One God' was "Great
Yeh-ho-vah." (p. 103) In one of the Mexican stories, there is a
side comment that the Toltecs had gigantic corn, of which our corn
is merely what they grew to heat their baths. (p. 113) The Toltecs
report that when he changed their temples he put a mosaic in each
room symbolizing different stages of life. (p. 118) Apparently the
Spanish destroyed a statue of a 'Christ-like man ... with
outstretched arms' at the top of the Great Pyramid in Mexico when
they arrived. (p. 142) The Toltecs were instructed to hide their
books in caves until the 'bearded strangers' leave. (p. 167)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the book believes that the prophet was an Essene
priest of the group that Jesus was supposed to have been a part
of. (p. 202) Given the stories I think it is amazing the author
doesn't think it's Jesus, but whatev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1963/">1963</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
