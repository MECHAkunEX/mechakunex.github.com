[Final Fantasy XIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII), the latest installment of one of my favourite
franchises. [GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/ask-me-anything-final-fantasy-xiii/17-2004/) previewed the battle system. Dale North at
Destructoid talked about [what he loved](http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-loved-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162457.phtml) and [[http://www.destructoid.com/ten-things-i-didn-t-love-about-final-fantasy-xiii-162684.phtml][what he didn't
love]]. And this morning I listened to [Active Time Babble](http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3176689) talk about
it. That podcast is the impetus for this post.

I am excited about Final Fantasy XIII. I will buy it on release
day. I virtually never do this, particular not any more.

A few things in particular make me /very/ excited:
- *Challenging Battles:* Rumour is that the battles are actually
hard and you need to really strategize. One of the biggest
faults of many RPGs, IMHO, is that the only way they are
difficult is by requiring absurd grinding, rather than real
challenge. I've also heard when you die you can retry the battle
almost instantly. I love this if it means that the battles will
be even harder.
- *Controlled Progression:* ATB sounded off on how they were upset
that you couldn't unlock certain skills in the leveling system
before certain story events. I actually like this idea of this
because it means that I can't accidentally grind to the point of
making the game boring for myself. I have two problems when I
play RPGs: first, I am a completionist so I have to make sure I
found all the chests, etc and sometimes that means I spend what
seems like twice as long in the dungeon as was intended; second,
I love the combat so I never run or avoid battles. These
conspire together to often make me far too powerful after a
while and the battles lose their flavor. A recent example was
when I replayed Final Fantasy 6 and mowed through the final
battle without a single death because I invested (with hardly
any grinding at all) in Dual Magic. By controlling my
progression, it seems like I'll be able to explore and have fun
in combat without ruining the game for myself.
- *Controlled Cast:* ATB talked about how sometimes you are forced
to have certain characters in your party and that the story
dictates when they are around. This reminds me of Final Fantasy
IV (my second favourite) and the beginning of each part of Final
Fantasy VI (my favourite.) One thing that I like about this in
those games is that because you don't have a choice who is in
your party, they can actually be scripted to interact &lt;em&gt;in
character&lt;/em&gt; in the story events. In contrast, many of the
later Final Fantasy installments (and other RPGs) where you have
a lot of freedom ended with flat character interaction because
they must be pluggable. One of the things that ATB mentioned
about this is that it forces you to learn to use characters
strengths rather than having a single strategy. I don't think
FF4 or FF6 do this particularly well, but I wish they did. I
know myself. I know that in most games I don't use any magic
except in boss fights until the very end when I spam the
ultimate attack spell. I know that I never use debuffs or buffs
except maybe Haste. Part of my is disappointed in myself for it,
but I know I don't actually need them, so why bother? I get the
impression that FF13 will make me use them and I'm excited about
that.
- *Linear Progression:* ATB mentioned that you can't unlock all
the classes and abilities for all the characters, but you must
choose a few for each. I /love/ this. The thing I hate
most about Final Fantasy games past 4 is that you can make every
character basically exactly the same. (And the game mechanics
will often encourage you to do just that.)
- *Post-game:* The stupidest part in any game is the sidequest
time between when the end of the game is available to you and
when you actually walk through it. It is so absurd to spend half
of your time playing the game with The Great Evil about to fall
on the innocent. By the time you get around to the ending it is
hard to remember exactly what was going on. If you are a
completionist (like me), then the ending is a cake-walk, because
you've already defeated the Ultimate Secret Bosses and got all
the best equipment, etc. From the sound of things, FF13 will
force you to go through the ending, but then give you a
post-game where you can do side-quests, etc. I love the idea of
this because it seems to be the best of both worlds.

For giggles, I'll give my Final Fantasy ranking (main series only):
- Final Fantasy 6 - The most powerful story, the first really
expansive progression system and cast, etc.
- Final Fantasy 4 - The tightest and consistent package. Great.
- Final Fantasy 10 - The best modern release. The only problem that
I remember is blitzball.
- Final Fantasy 7 - Classic and still interesting.
- Final Fantasy 5 - The job system is classic and the world is interesting.
- Final Fantasy 12 - Really awkward moments and uninteresting
battles/progression.
- Final Fantasy 9 - I remember liking the world, but can't think of
anything else.
- Final Fantasy 8 - Almost no memory of it.
- Final Fantasy 1 - Grinding and the core mechanic.

(I've never played 2, 3, 10-2, or 11. I don't think 11 really
counts anyways. I'd like to do 8 and 9 again.)</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Final Fantasy 13/">Final Fantasy 13</a></li><li><a href="/cat/PS3/">PS3</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2009/">2009</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
