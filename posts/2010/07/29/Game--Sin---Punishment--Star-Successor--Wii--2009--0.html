(it came out on a Sunday) after pre-ordering from Gamestop.

/Sin and Punishment: Star Successor/ is a masterpiece worthy of
comparison to the original. I am out of control crazy about this
game.

The best reviews of this game are...

Here's the first draft of my review for Sin &amp; Punishment: Star
Successor in its entirety:

"YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

While I think that pretty well encapsulates the feeling of
playing Star Successor, I realize there might be value to
explaining what the game is and why I enjoyed it so much. But even
though there are more words to follow, they are all written in the
same spirit as the above all-caps exclamation. Even thinking back
about playing Treasure's latest game is kind of exciting. This is
not a game to relax with after a long day at work. This is a game
to play if you want to get so amped up you start typing in CAPITAL
LETTERS.

Bottom line: Sin and Punishment: Successor to the Sky is “a
veritable monster pancake stack of delicious, sticky
frictions”.

So, Treasure fans, do not be afraid: the sequel to Sin and
Punishment pulls no punches. It is the scariest kind of
straight-ahead run-and-gun shooter for its first half, and the
most teeth-grinding type of perfectionist boss parade for its
second half. We got over our hang-ups regarding the first Sin and
Punishment‘s terrible story and voice acting, and learned to love
the idiocy in the sequel — which weirdly now takes place in a
universe where everyone speaks Japanese, where the people cower
under the shadow of a weird, sick, evil empire whose entire
economy exists to purchase bullets. What in the flaming [beep]
happens in this story, we don’t know, though we love it so much
we’ve played it nine times. We didn’t even skip the cut-scenes
for, like, three of those times. They’re so much terser, this time
around. There’s less of the burning desire to “explain”. We have
our two characters — a boy and a girl he’s trying to protect — on
the run from people who want the girl. It turns out the boy was
sent to kill the girl — cleverly, before the story begins — though
something about her changed his mind. How nice; how small. All of
the conversations in the game attack the “give us the girl” line
from a different angle. The boy’s retorts similarly reinvent the
“Never!” The bad guys have miniature personalities. We have a
Japanese girl who has a sword, and a Chinese guy who commands a
flaming dragon, and a fat man who can turn into a manta ray or a
whole conference of killer whales, for example. At one point, you
ride a lizard down a highway while shooting at a giant sprinting
tiger. Later, you sprint or fly down a catwalk, sword-deflecting
stampeding buffalo at distant airborne gunships. By the end of the
game, you’re in space, fighting a monolithic Ikaruga ship. Either
way, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, whatever in the
hell is “happening” in your character’s immediate surroundings,
whatever the enemies / monsters / robots are made of, the conflict
is always clear: here’s a guy trying to not die, and succeeding
maybe-gorgeously. We love this game. We even love the music — the
boss fight themes are so well-produced that we instantly thought,
“so this is what Treasure was trying to do with the Mega Drive
sound chip!”

The pure insanity of this game. The perfection. The detail. The
polish. Yikes.

The only problem with the game, for me, is that I'm a
perfectionist and want to 1CC it, but it is incredibly long (about
3 hours) and even though you can "Save &amp; Quit" without dying, if
you do that your score resets to zero, meaning it won't score like
you actually did a 1CC. Thus, it is a major commitment to make a
run.

my wife and I did a co-op 1CC on Easy with Isa. I'd like to 1CC
it by myself though (many times actually!) Although I've seen a
lot of people criticize the co-op play because it is asymmetric
(the second player only controls a crosshair, so they don't need
to dodge, and cannot charge shot), the people (my wife and my dad)
I've played with enjoy it and wouldn't like it if they had to do
more.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor/">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Wii/">Wii</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2009/">2009</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
