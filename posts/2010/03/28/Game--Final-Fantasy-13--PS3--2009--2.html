FF13. I've been delaying reading any until after I beat, so I
think now is the appropriate time. I will do my best to not be a
rabid fan boy about it. My goal is to capture my reactions to new
ideas I read elsewhere, rather than to argue anyone who disagrees
with my preferences.

[Tim Rogers](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630). This review is hilarious, as all his are. (He curses a
lot by the way.) Here's a great quote: "The idea of the game is
that the characters all look like people who someone would want to
cosplay; they all act like characters who would be someone’s
favorite character." His discussion of the battle system is spot
on. I suppose the big difference is that I love it and he
doesn't. Same with launching enemies into the air. Here's
something that is quite true:

{% blockquote %} The battles will sometimes envelop you in
sometimes ten entire minutes of grueling uphill climbing, forcing
you to know that you’re doing something wrong. You pray for a
zero-star ranking, for there to be some obvious “right way” to do
this. Then the game gives you a five-star ranking, and your heart
sinks: oh god, you are doing it the right way.
{% endblockquote %}

Just read his comment about the monsters not looking like
anything. That's true and its always been that way. I'm totally in
his "that's the way things are" camp.

[Jim Sterling](http://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xiii-167136.phtml). "If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy XIII fan, prone
to emotional outburts and so defensive of Square Enix's latest
effort that you'll get upset by harsh criticism, then you're
advised to not read this review. If you don't want to see somebody
tear this game limb from limb, or are upset by videogame review in
general, then you should definitely not read it." I can see why
someone would be upset at his review, but I'm not in the
least. [I'm amazed at how people react to him](http://www.destructoid.com/the-joys-of-being-a-videogame-reviewer-167383.phtml).

I read a bunch of other reviews but didn't really feel like
commenting on any of them.
