commensurate with how much I like it. I played it almost every day
in July and the beginning of August, but then I stopped for a
while. As I predicted in my first post on it, the inability to
save your score across sessions prevented me from really getting
into a 1CC run, because I thought I could only binge on the 3 hour
ordeal of a run, rather than playing it incrementally like most
other games I play.

Just recently I decided to pick it up again, but with a
determination to play it incrementally and adjust my goals to make
that more realistic. Rather than pursing a whole game 1CC, I would
target clearing each level without dying as well as completing the
game in each mode, with however many continues were needed. Since
then I've completed it on Easy with Isa, Kachi, and Isa&amp;Kachi and
on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. I've 1CC'd every stage on Easy in each
mode and all but 3, 6, and 7 on Normal with Isa&amp;Kachi. (Naturally
those are the longest levels.) I intend on practicing those levels
until I can clear them, then moving on to the Hard difficulty.

Of course, once I decided to not go for a 1CC, I got one on
Easy with Isa&amp;Kachi. So rad.

Since I've been playing again, I've thought about all that I
appreciate about the game. One new thing I've thought about is the
way even though there is no real story or explanation of the
world, the stages themselves are fascinating snippets of what the
world is like. For example, in Stage 2, you are traveling through
an underwater tunnel and there are speed limit signs. It makes me
wonder what those tunnels were used for and what the vehicles that
drove on them were like. Another detail I enjoy is that in the
highway stage through the desert, Kachi takes off her jacket,
because it would be too hot otherwise.

It is a really remarkable game.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor/">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Wii/">Wii</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2009/">2009</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
