and I just finished it this morning. Before I started reading it, I
had the same cultural assumption as most of the people around me:
that it was a tawdry sex manual. However, I was reading the
Wikipedia page and it said:

"Some Indian philosophies follow the "four main goals of
life", known as the purusharthas:
* Dharma: Virtuous living.
* Artha: Material prosperity.
* Kama: Aesthetic and erotic pleasure.
* Moksha: *REDACTED*eration.

Dharma, Artha and Kama are aims of everyday life, while Moksha is
release from the cycle of death and rebirth. The Kama Sutra (Burton
translation) says:

"Dharma is better than Artha, and Artha is better than Kama. But
Artha should always be first practised by the king for the
livelihood of men is to be obtained from it only. Again, Kama being
the occupation of public women, they should prefer it to the other
two, and these are exceptions to the general rule." (Kama Sutra
1.2.14)"

Of the first three, virtue is the highest goal, a secure life the
second and pleasure the least important. When motives conflict, the
higher ideal is to be followed. Thus, in making money virtue must
not be compromised, but earning a living should take precedence
over pleasure, but there are exceptions."

This suggests that our cultural assumption is inaccurate. After
reading it, I agree. So much of the book is really just about
happiness in marriage, appreciation of the arts, etc.

Although there is talk of sexual positions, I find them incredibly
vague to the point of being indecipherable: "The woman grabs the
man with her leg as a monkey climbs a tree", etc. The vast majority
of the book is about correct conduct in marriage, courting, and
romantic life generally. There is a huge amount of content on the
strategies and tactics employed by prostitutes. That section is
surprisingly interesting because while it presents itself as advice
to prostitutes, I read it more as a warning to potential customers
by exposing the prostitute's logic. The final chapters on magical
and occult practices are interesting for the sheer bizarreness of
the suggestions the book makes to improve your sex life.

Overall, I found the book to be very interesting and primarily a
time capsule of the life of nobility in the far Hindu past.

Finally, a hilarious warning: "Sometimes, during the night, the
woman lying in one's arms emits a smell of sweat and does not hold
her evil-smelling wind." (p. 58) It then prescribes that certain
flowers, ointments, etc are on hand to deal with such
odors.
