DS. I'd never played a game in this series before and it's been a
long time since I've played a tactical game like this---although
/Devil Survivor/ was definitely tactically-inspired.

I really enjoyed the game. I especially liked how hard it
felt. I think I only lost two or three missions (but beat them on
the second try), but for nearly all the missions after the
tutorial levels, I felt pushed to my limit and nearly losing. I
like that sensation, because it keeps the game very exciting.

During the majority of the time I played the game, I would make my
moves for a round, and then I would go do something else (like
practicing Japanese) and then look back when it was my turn
again. It was amazing to me how long it would often take before I
could take a turn again. I consider this a problem with the game,
although it worked out for good in my case because I was glad to
be getting something else done as well without giving it my total
focus.

Perhaps my favourite thing about the game was how by the end, I
was regularly using almost all the features of the combat. This
suggests to me that the mechanics are well-designed and actually
useful.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Advance Wars: Dual Strike/">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</a></li><li><a href="/cat/DS/">DS</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
