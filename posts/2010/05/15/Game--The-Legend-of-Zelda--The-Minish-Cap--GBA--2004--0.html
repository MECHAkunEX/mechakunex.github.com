Minish Cap. I knew I was almost done, so I stayed up a little too
late finish it tonight.

The graphics in this game are beautiful and vibrant. Many games
these days are dark and muddy, so it is refreshing to have such a
bright game. The game has the same style as /Link to the Past/,
but with a bit more cudly-ness.

The sound is good. I caught my wife humming a few of the
tunes.

The story is a respectable Zelda story. I like that the title
is a double entendre.

The gameplay is very good. It has the same core mechanics as
the first Zelda and /Link to the Past/ (my two
favourite), but almost all the items are brand new. The Kinstone
system (wherein you collect trinkets and give them to particular
NPCs) is a nice abstraction of a quest mechanic, although I
would've liked to have been able to get to the bonuses without
using a Kinstone, somehow. The boss fights are very fun and
difficult enough---I had to repeat two of them and the final
boss's first form got me the first time. The dungeon designs are
good. The puzzles are interesting without being infuriating. I
only had a few times where I wanted to throw the control (all in
the Wind Palace, btw.) The world is big enough to make it
interesting and the teleport system is convenient.

I finished the game with 14 heart containers, two bottles,
without the boomerang, with the original shield, without any bomb
bag/quiver upgrades (actually I'm not sure if there are any) and
with all the sword techniques. It was a little hard to complete
with such a small amount of life and only two bottles, but it was
obviously do-able and fun.

I definitely still prefer /Link to the Past/, but
this is worth playing again and thus worth playing for the first
time too.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap/">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a></li><li><a href="/cat/GBA/">GBA</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2004/">2004</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
