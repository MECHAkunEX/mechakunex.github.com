good. I found a lot of the acting a little "eh", but the world was
really cool. It's like a Sci-Fi version of the *REDACTED* doctrine that
Satan (and his followers) have no body, but want one, and can
possess humans and that their goal is for everyone to be "good" but
without the agency to decide to be good. A lot of what goes on in
the movie is clearly deeply inspired by this idea.

Some of the worst parts of the movie are classic Stephanie though:
for instance, the crazy love square with two people in one body,
which is at its craziest when Wanderer kisses two boys within
minutes.

There are some logical problems with the plot that I thought of,
or at least big questions:

- How do the Souls originally start the invasion? We see them enter
bodies by making an incision and then crawling in. It seems like
to start off, they would have to arrive not in "Soul" form but in
other bodies on traditional ships. Yet, we see them only travel
through space in their little Soul capsules.

- If it takes so long to travel between planets, as Wanderer says,
then how is it that there are Souls arriving periodically in the
first place. They would have had to have left long long before
the invasion of Earth started, confident that they would
eventually take it over, and given that the Souls do not appear
to be conscious during their capsule time, how would they steer
to the planet unless they knew already that it was inhabitable
and knew where the landing pad would be?

I like it when a book or movie leaves lots of interesting questions
about its universe. I'm interested in reading the book now.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
