but still was not moved.

The graphics were a lot better right away, but the slow movement
was still there. The theming of the castle was pretty bad... big
empty rooms, nothing to suggest it is a "throne room" and the
opening sequence was pretty bold in its simplicity.

The menu interface was pretty novel with the response message
being displayed in place. It was kind of neat, but ultimately
pretty painful. The equipping interface was particularly painful.

It took a very long time to figure out how I was supposed to
save. I guessed that it would happened when I went to the inn and
it felt a little weird to start fighting before I saved, but I did
so I wouldn't waste the money.

The battle music was so bad and the interface was very
confusing. Once I realized what the things meant it was pretty
smooth, at least until I wanted to pick my actions
individually. Then it was real bad, because when you want to do
something non-automatic the sequence is: Manual &gt; *REDACTED*acter &gt;
Confirm? &gt; Selection &gt; Target &gt; Auto. Ouch.

I wandered around, found two towns and a cave, but then died
without any clue what I was supposed to do next.

I can't imagine playing through it because it felt so tedious in
so many ways.
