I was
always a SNES player, even though I had a Genesis, I found it to
be pretty lacking on good games. I think we got it because of the
advertising, but quickly found that the SNES would be better. In
any case, I've never played any of the Phantasy Star games, but
I've naturally heard a lot of good things about them because
people seem to like them.

I am sure that I would feel a little differently about this game
if I played it when it was released, but I found it completely
intolerable: the shop interface was horrific (doesn't tell you
what is good or let you equip it), the combat was painful (ugly,
the sound effects were awful, and it was just slow), etc.

Compared to other early RPGs around this time, like DQ4 or even
FF4, it's ridiculously bad. Ugh.

In any case, I bought a hat and went outside looking for the bio
lab. I got in three fights and used the available attacks and
died. I guess I should have done some grinding to get strong
enough to explore... but if that's the case then I'm definitely
not interested in playing through this.

The short dialogue scene I saw was kind of neat. It was cool that
everything was "first person" in the description.
