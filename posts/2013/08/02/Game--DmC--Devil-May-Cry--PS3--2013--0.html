missions. This game is *awesome*. The combat system flows really
well and the Demon/Angel weapon system is a very cool way to do
it. I'm very excited about using the pull towards/pull to system
during combat. I love it when an ability is useful in traversal
and combat---the best things in Metroidvanias is when the
abilities aren't just "keys", but have many uses.

The style of the game is really neat. I like that everything isn't
static and seems to be alive and reacting to you. The words that
appear all over the scenery when you get attacked is super cool
too. The opening of the game was particularly ridiculous.  It's a
bit disappointing that Dante's motivation is just "My mom was
killed", which is a classic "Women in the Fridge" plot-line.

I don't like how much vulgarity there is in the game though. It
makes me feel like I can't play it as much, because I normally
play games around my little kids. I guess I'll have to keep it for
when they're asleep.

I was so impressed with my first two hours with the game, I feel
like I want to do everything possible in the game and play all the
difficulty levels. We'll see how I feel after I beat it once
though :) I was a little nervous when I started though, because I
wasn't super impressed with the previous game and had never played
a Ninja Theory game, but I was still interested from the Giantbomb
Quick Look and discussion I'd heard.
