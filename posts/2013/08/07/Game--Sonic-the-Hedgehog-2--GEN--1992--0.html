Zone 2, which is the fifth level. I cannot say I like this game,
but it is not horrific to control and work with, and it is very
important historically, so I am going to finish it, because I
think it deserves it.

I think it is kind of ridiculous that I was able to get through so
many stages so quickly. In most of the stages, you feel like you
just hold Right on the D-pad until you are hit out of nowhere by
an enemy or obstacle you'd never be able to see. It feels like the
height of "unfair difficulty" where the only way to succeed is by
trial-and-error.

At least once you get hit, you aren't really damaged and can
pretty trivially get your Rings back and move on. But then, you
aren't going fast anymore and you can almost never actually make
the jumps you need to while standing, so you have to meander
backwards until you can get a long enough run. It just feels so
inelegant and ugly.

On the other hand, when you actually do need to go slow, like when
you are carefully going through some platforming over lava or in
water, it is very hard to make small movements because Sonic
generally moves very quickly. It's very frustrating.

I have a very hard time believing that this game is so beloved and
was ever seen as a contender against Mario. It makes me think that
Sega kids were just totally blind and stunted by having to live in
their impoverished state.
