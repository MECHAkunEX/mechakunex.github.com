Mario, and the Halloween one.

This is a very bizarre Mario game. It has enemies that are
uniquely occurring and behave very differently from other Mario
games. The collision detection is very strange... for instance,
some of the backgrounds have 3D effects and this causes it to look
like you are walking on a totally sheer or missing surface because
the visual is much smaller than the hit-box for it. This is
particularly painful with the huge bosses.

The continue system is strange. I had to continue a few times and
was very annoyed to see my coins go away, but I could tell what
was going on: you get to start up again with all the levels beat,
but you have to go back for the coins. Basically, that means that
to beat the game, you can beat every level individually, but you
have to come back and do six levels (with boss fights) to finish.

It's strange because if the game were purely linear, like the
first Mario, I don't think I would mind very much. But, because
the game is so large and non-linear, I feel like progress is being
stolen from me.

In any case, this game has the classic problem for me of being an
ancient, awkward Gameboy game where so much is atrocious and the
stuff that is good, in this case the game-play, feels like it has
to make sacrifices because of the small screen real estate. Thus,
another game that I can recognize the goodness in, but can't bring
myself to dedicate to playing. I like that I was able to beat
about half of it though.
