dungeon. 

Like its prequel, Neutopia 2 seemed perfect to me as a kid: a more
beautiful version of Zelda on an exotic Japanese console! What
could be better?

After playing it for a while, I found it a very sub-par copy of
Zelda. There are lots of little things that made it that way:

* One of the important things to me about Zelda is that power-ups
are not just "keys" but are generally useful throughout the
dungeons for lots of little purposes. In contrast, the first
power-up you get in this game is new Armor and you get the
impression that new Armor and Weapons will be a recurring
power-up. I think that power-ups like this are the laziest
because they replace a more interesting difficulty curve and
challenge with a ratcheting up of numbers alone.

* An essential piece of the Zelda meta-game is preserving your
health until you fight the boss deep in the dungeon after an
unsuccessful run. The "puzzles" in Zelda whereby you must
destroy all the enemies in a room before you can push forward
necessitates engaging with most enemies, and thus risking
damage. I found that in the first dungeon of this game I could
generally casually walk past enemies without much fear of
danger.

* A key piece of a good game is that it teaches you how to win and
rewards you for learning a "useful" skill. A classic example is
a boss fight where the boss moves relatively predictably and you
must learn their moves and exploit them. It is essential that
the boss actually give you clues to their moves, however. The
Sand Worm boss in the first dungeon of Neutopia 2, which is a
knock-off a similar Zelda boss, doesn't give such cues. It
appears randomly and selects a random spot to land in, often
going so high in the air and with such erratic curves that it is
impossible to track and anticipate. This feels un-fair and not
fun.

* Finally, a much smaller issue, I feel like the "upgrade" to
Zelda wherein you can walk on almost any pixels but it is very
easy to get mis-aligned with the enemy and very difficult to
hit.

Nevertheless, I wouldn't say the game is horrible, but it clearly
is not in the "canon" that I am trying to discover, so after
giving it its due (by beating the first level), I abandoned it.
