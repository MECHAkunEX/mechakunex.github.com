seemed like campy supernatural action. It definitely had
that... it was like a long Buffy episode.

I found it too gross for my taste though. It has lots of
unnecessary swearing and gross moments. I think worst instance of
stupid swearing was the curse on the dying breath of the "good"
witch. It's kind of sad that the audience the movie is designed for
would really respond to stuff like that. Maybe that means I'm
stupid? But I feel like you can enjoy the campy B-movie-ness and
don't need vulgarity.

The most disturbing was the attempted rape scene, because it
dis-empowers Gretel, who is normally really tough and
awesome. After that point in movie, Gretel kept being
damseled... it was annoying. On one hand, it's good that she put up
such a fight, but I was amazed that they would even suggest
something like that. I assumed he'd just be a punk and beat her
up. It was also bizarre to contrast it with what was happening with
Hansel.

It made me think about how a witch hunting is kind of the purest
form of violence against women for the sake of it. In real history
(and in the movie, a little with the redhead), accusations of witch
craft were used to attack women who broke social rules that weren't
really crimes. In the movie, at least they always put weird
disfiguring makeup on the witches, but it was a little distasteful.

There were some cute moments in the movie too. For instance, I like
the suggestion that Hansel has diabetes from being for too eat too
much candy as a kid. A guy helps Gretel and gives her porridge that
"isn't too cold or too hot". Hansel is about to approach a house
and he throws a rock at it, presumably to make sure it is real.

The main detail I didn't like were all the guns and even a
tazer. Even though they were dressed up in a steampunky way, it was
pretty dumb.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
