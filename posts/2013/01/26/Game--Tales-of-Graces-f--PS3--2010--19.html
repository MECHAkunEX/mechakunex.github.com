of little breaks. I basically just did the last dungeon, but I
popped out once to do a few more requests and side quests.

I found it really interesting during the final moments of the game
to learn more about Lambda and how he was created and lived.

The side quest with the sick girl and the dolls was very cute and
had a nice twist in its ending. I also liked how one of the dolls
was the Prince from Katamari.

Two of my favourite skits so far were: when Asbel asks Pascal how
she got from the Amarcian Enclave to where the group was. Her
explanation was ridiculous. The other was when Pascal says that
Cheria is "chubbing out" and then her reaction to that comment.

I picked a fun set of costumes for my characters by the end of the
game: Sophie's pirate outfit, Cheria's new dress, Pascal's
swimsuit, Asbel's black outfit, and the two 'modern' outfits for
Malik and Hubert. I think they're all the best ones.

The last boss was very hard. I tried first on Chaos and got him to
half his health before running out of Elixirs and being
decimated. I next tried Evil and almost won but it was pretty
rough, so I decided when I tried again I'd do Hard. I did it that
time and got the Hard trophy (but not the Moderate
one... annoying.) A key I discovered was using the Hourglass
after his Mystic Artes had killed so many characters.

The ending was pretty intense and had a surprising resolution.

--

All together, it took my 68 hours and 18 minutes to get to the
"end" of the game. Of course, there's the Lineage &amp; Legacies
expansion, so I'm doing that too and will consider that to be the
actual end of the game.

It's pretty cool so far. My favourite skits have been the ones
about marriage. It's so cute that all of Asbel's proposals remind
him of Cheria and Cheria's crazy dream about their wedding day.

I don't yet understand the Accel system and I'm surprised that any
of the other characters would be able to use it given the story
explanation for its existence.
