I made
it to the other planet, but haven't talked to anyone yet. I
thought the movie as the characters were launching to the other
planet was pretty awesome... particularly Fourier's army. I like
how much mystery there is around the other planet, the ring around
the planet the characters are from, etc. Although, I dislike how
little the characters seem to be reacting to the idea that there
is another planet, more people, etc.

It's been very tough to not have Sophie in the party. I've
decided to drop down the difficulty level to Evil, since no one
else can heal as effectively as she can. This is a little tough
for me, because (something I forgot to mention I liked yesterday)
the higher difficulties give you benefits. (As opposed to a game
like Persona, where the higher difficulty levels just punish you
and for you to grind more.)

Exploring the Snowshroud Ruins was a little ridiculous because all
the switches had the worst initial placement. It was almost absurd
how predictable it was that they'd be in the wrong place.

In Telos Astue, I noticed a typo in a skit subtitling: it said
"my" rather than "may" when Hubert was speaking.

I played for another almost two hours and explored through the
first dungeon on Fodra. I got Sophie's memories back, but they
weren't too exciting because I had already guessed most
everything. The biggest revelation was that Cornell really made
Lambda and there's something sinister about his creation and
Fodra.

After church, I played for an hour and got to Bathus Citadel. The
monsters on the way were tough because they could turn you to
stone and then kill you very quickly. Once I got used to
targeting them fast, it was much easier though.
