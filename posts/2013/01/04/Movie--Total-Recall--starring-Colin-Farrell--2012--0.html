I liked the original and I thought
this was a great modernization. It did a very good job of having
many layers of memories and doubt at what his true personality was.

Some little things:
- The Fall was very cool
- At one point near the end of the movie, Quaid refers to the name
of Jessica Biel's character and even though it's the end of the
movie, this is the first time we've heard her name.
- Jessica Biel is convincing as an action person, although she
doesn't have enough practice as Kate Beckinsale.
- Beckinsale looks great, as usual. My wife noticed how everything
about her character is to be super sexy. She can't stand still or
talk on the phone without pouting or standing
seductively. Whereas Biel puts her hair in a pony-tail when they
are chased, Beckinsale leaves her hair down so it looks better. I
don't think these things are terrible, but it is interesting.

The worst thing about Beckinsale's character is the ridiculously
bad lines she's given. They are bad for an 80s star: "I give
good wife." (This makes no sense, is out of context in the
scene, and is just there to make you think of her doing
something else.) "Do you think I'd let you leave without one
last kiss?" and many lines like it that are lame 50s Spider
Man/Batman quips.
- Seeing the three-breasted woman was a surprise given the rating.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
