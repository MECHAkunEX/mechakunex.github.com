I spent the first 30-ish
minutes trying to do Stage 35 and then gave up for a bit and
tried Stage 36. When that was still hard, I went back to Stage 35
and beat it. (Along with getting two achievements.)

Stage 35 --- I eventually won by using the Napalm and doing a
Dash-to-Freeze pattern over and over against Longai-O. The giant
guy was easy once I got behind him and I did the final room in
one try.

Stage 36 --- This seems impossible. I was able to race back on one
of the times I tried, but didn't kill everything, which is when I
learned I had to.

This game is getting to the point where it is so hard that I feel
like it hard to play for more than an hour or so at a time
because I'm just doing the same level over and over again. I
still love it... it's just stressful.

----

Later in the day, I did another hour.

Stage 36 --- I eventually did this and the key was getting a lot
of practice and learning to conserve my counters well. After a few
tries, I did it.

Stage 37 --- This was a totally insane level full of
Dash-and-Counter forever. I'm amazed that this was in the
tutorial.

Stage 38 --- This level had a totally obscene amount of bullets
and it was totally insane when it first started, because I had no
idea what was going to happen. Eventually it was pretty easy once
I made a point of taking out the batters on the right first.

Stage 39 --- This was a challenging and fun level. The key was to
dash along the force fields and then counter every few segments
to kill the ones of the top. I wasn't totally perfect... I missed
a few things a few times, so I had to backtrack a little bit. It
made it so I had only 15 seconds to spare when I won.

Stage 40 --- This is a really tough level because each phase is
so different. I got to the two Longai-O once, but have a very
hard time freezing them in general, so I failed. I can reasonably
reliably get past the first stage, but the ants really get me.
