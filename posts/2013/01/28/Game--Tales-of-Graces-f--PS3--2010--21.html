For the first thing, I
beat Poisson, using basically the same technique as last time,
but she didn't get to use her Mystic Artes on me, so I won.

During the session there were a lot of cute skits. There was a
great one of Hubert complaining about how scandalous Richard's
final battle costume was; one where Cheria thought she was too fat
and broke the elevator because she had a sweet potato; one where
Lambda tells Pascal to figure something out herself and then ruins
her discovery by revealing it at the last moment. It's great
stuff. :) An odd thing I noticed today in a lot of the scenes was
that Lords, Kings, Leaders, etc all have lots of paperwork to do
and it defines their life. I think game was made in Japan. :)

I did the final dungeon and final battle. The very last area was
very beautiful and the last battle was pretty insane. I loved the
whole counter thing, although I'm not sure how you'd know to do
it.

The ending is nice. I think Sophie's new getup looks
awesome... too bad it doesn't unlock a title so you can have her
like that all the time. I also thought the resolution of the
various romances was sweet.

I loaded up New Game+ to see what my grade was: 1774. I think I
can do a little bit more dualizing, plus some of the EX Dungeon
to get it higher. I intend to do that. Unfortunately, I missed
some skits and side-quests early on, so I can't possibly get
those 100%. Grr.
