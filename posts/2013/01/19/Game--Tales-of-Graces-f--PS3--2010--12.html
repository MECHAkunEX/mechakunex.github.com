Fendel Tower. After my experience on the mountain, I had enough
strength to totally cream most enemies today---including the Lab
boss on Chaos! I'm starting to run out of titles to acquire and
I'm starting to master old ones. I really enjoy the naming
convention on the Amarcians: Fermat, Pascal, Fourier, Gauss. :)

Later in the day, I played for another three hours and go to
before going to World's Eye. Although I'm a bit confused, because
I forgot there was a port in Zhavert... although I guess that's
how I got there? I had a very tough time with the enemies on
Chaos in the ice cave. I also decided to specifically try to get
my characters to use more attacks to gain Adept and Master titles
for them.

After my kids went to bed, I played for another hour and half. I
got to where the Shuttle is, but haven't taken the detour to
Lhant yet. I was very proud of my fight against Richard, because
I was able to beat him on Evil. (I got creamed on Chaos.) I
progressed the story a bit and went on the shipwreck side-quest
in Oul Raye, but died because of stupid Hubert. It's really
annoying to not have Sophie in my party, because she's an
essential part of my strategy and I've been using her the whole
time. This sequence of the game is a bit annoying in the amount
of running around you need to do. It feels like I spend more time
walking to a place than being there are fighting/learning about
the story.

After such a long day playing, I reflected a bit on the game. I
really like the story as an avenue for the characters to
interact. I think my favourite character is Pascal. They really
sell the way she acts and I like the way they don't have to have
pseudo-science explanations, because she just uses terms like
"thingamajigger" and such. It's cute.

I really enjoy the combat system. If I were playing on a
different difficulty level, I could imagine feeling it was boring
and rote, but because I have it at the maximum... it is pretty
stressful and requires a nice rhythm to it. I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable with it at the moment, because I'm trying to go
outside my comfort zone to get different titles for Asbel, but
it's still good. It's pretty awesome.
