I got to the Amarcian
Enclave and verified my hypothesis that Pascal is really an
Amarcian and that there are few left. When we got there, it was
interesting that one of the people said that we were people from
"the world below"---meaning they are in the sky. I had previously
assumed that they were underground. I wonder if the weird ring you
sometimes see in the sky is one of their creations or something?

There were some funny moments today in the skits. I enjoyed one
where Sophie said her favourite food was Crablettes (Crab
Omelettes) and Malik couldn't get a word in edgewise about the
food he liked. There was another where Hubert said that Cheria
was dressed indecently and he couldn't believe how much of her
thigh was revealed in combat. It was very funny to have two react
to that situation. :)

Gameplay-wise, I unlocked the Chaos difficulty. It is incredibly
hard. Almost every random battle can take me out. I think I
should camp on Mt. Zhavert for a bit and get up some
levels. There was a time when I had to beat one enemy at a time
and then run back to the Save Point because I was so nervous
about dying and losing progress. (I died maybe... six times in
that area.) When I fought the Boar boss at the end, I did pretty
well on Chaos, but ultimately dropped it to Evil to do it.

I did the whole first set of the Shot Cube puzzle game. It's
pretty fun.
