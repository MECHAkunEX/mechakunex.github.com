over, I can watch it. I thought the first episode was fun. I
liked the actors and the action was interesting. I think the two
scientists characters will have to grow on me a little, because I
think they act a little too extreme-to-type. The world it seems
to be creating is neat.

I found a lot of the minor details of the plot to be
obvious---for example, you can't have a guy tell a girl he loves
her (and have her be happy about it) on the first episode, unless
you're going to kill him or cause him to be a bad guy: and they
did both!

I think my only complaint about it is the way "fringe science" is
used as some weird boogey-man discussed in hushed tones, as if
anyone in the real world actually cares about it. It was also
weird that "artificial intelligence" is listed as one of the
fringe science ideas in the beginning. Finally, it's so lazy in
the title sequence that the same terms are repeated and it's not
even trying to depict "moving around a space" where the letters
are.

It's also a little lame that in the very first episode we see
Agent Dunham half-naked in bed and then it's a crucial plot point
that she has to disrobe to her underwear for us to gawk at. It's
especially ridiculous because part of the character background is
that she's not respected by people (who constantly call her
"sweetheart") for being a woman and that she is a particularly
strong woman and defender of woman (in her defense of the raped
women in her past). This is so ridiculous, because in one part of
the show we're supposed to be appalled by the bad behavior of the
men vis-a-vis her gender, but in another part the producers put
us right into their seat.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Fringe/">Fringe</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
