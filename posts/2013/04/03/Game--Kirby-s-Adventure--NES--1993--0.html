I got to the boss of the third
level and used one continue in the process. I found the game to
be really interesting... the variety of power-ups is pretty
absurd and the cuteness of the game is off the hook. I found the
mechanics to be passable, but not lovable.

The biggest pain in the mechanics was that it was to easy to
accidentally take a puff and launch into the air rather than just
do a normal jump and then when you accidentally got a power-up, it
was hard to get rid of it. It felt like it really needed a SNES
controller to have a distinct button for some of these things, or
if you could fly by doing a double jump or something. Finally, it
felt like there was a lot of lag in the controls, which normally
didn't matter, but was pretty horrible on the boss fights.

I just ran through the majority of the stages and only had to
think during the boss fights. The boss fights were solved by
either getting the perfect power-up right before or memorizing
the sequence of actions.

This is one of those games that I can see the beauty of at the
time, but similar games have such better systems, that it isn't
worth getting into. It has definitely convinced me to try future
Kirby games though.
