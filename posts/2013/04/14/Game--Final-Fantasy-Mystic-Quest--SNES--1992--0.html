hours. I got up through the Wintry Cave.

I remember playing this game when I was a kid and thinking it was
really strange, for a Final Fantasy game, but fine. As I got
older, I thought back on it as being silly and I recognized what a
bad reputation it had with a lot of people. There's this idea that
it was released in the US instead of FF5 and that's it is very
simple and bland.

I see where those people are coming from, because it is definitely
a lot simpler than what came directly before or directly after,
but I'm finding it very enjoyable.

Although it was very clearly designed as "My First RPG", the
things that they did to streamline it are fine and even good. In
fact, it anticipates changes in later Final Fantasy games. For
example:

- The overworld is not a map that you can walk around on (and get
lost) [or find secrets], instead it is a graph of interconnected
nodes. This is just like FF10. The lack of random battles to get
in is compensated with the "battleground" concept, which gives
you an indication of how much you should be grinding and gives a
nice little reward.

- When you die in battle, you can immediately try again from
where your stats were before the battle started. This is like
FF13. Unfortunately, whereas FF13 used this to make every
battle very challenging (combined with the no meta-game), in
FF:MQ the battles aren't particularly tough. (Although the
status effects are common and brutal.)

- Weapons and armor are automatically equipped and you always use
what is best. Except not exactly, because you can change weapons
really simply with the shoulder buttons. I like this because in
FF4, for instance, there's basically only three situations where
you would ever want to not use the best stuff. (1) When you go
to the Dark Elf cave, (2) when you fight the elements and want
to use the right protections, and (3) when you can't afford the
best for everyone and want to control who gets it. This
streamlining is very nice.

- You can save /anywhere/!

- All enemies are visible.

Another thing about the game I'm enjoying is the light action
elements. I associate them a lot with Lufia II, although this game
predates it. It adds a nice bit of variety and fun.

I find the story to very bland, but passable. It's very similar to
the straight-forward-ness of FF1 or Zelda, but with a few fun
dialogue choices and elements.
