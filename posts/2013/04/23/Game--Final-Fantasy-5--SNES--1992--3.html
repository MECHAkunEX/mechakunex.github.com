about half of my overall job planning goals. I still had about
half left and a total of about 1000 ABP left to get. I calculated
my ABP efficiency:
- Always get 4 or 8 ABP per fight
- Always win every fight because Galuf has highest speed and can
always cast Lvl 5 Doom
- Can do 8 fights for every use of a Cabin to get back MP
- A Cabin costs 600 GP
- Each fight gives 1014 GP or 2535 GP
- Each fight gives 50 XP or 125 XP

This means that every cycle of fights, I get, assuming equal
numbers of two statue and five statue fights:
- 48 ABP
- 13596 GP
- 700 XP

Since this process has no risk, it is essentially an arbitrage
opportunity in the game to get infinite resources.

This means that it would take about 21 cycles to get all my ABP
requirements satisfied. I would also net 285k GP and 14700 XP. This
would only bring me up two levels (I'm 25 now), which is not a
significant source of XP. It's also about double my gold.  I
estimate that this would take about four hours to do, based on
getting about 500 ABP in two hours.

When there are situations like this in a game, I wish it were
possible to give the game a proof or a program that it was possible
for me to get the resources, so I didn't have to actually spend my
time to it. It seems wrong to spend my valuable time on such
things.

Putting all this together, I decided to dump the SRAM from my
PowerPak and then wrote a program to adjust my total ABP to
expedite this process. It was a little complicated to find where
they were stored and then adjust the checksums. (The key was that
the SNES is little endian.) Implementing the program and running it
took about an hour and a half... which is still a time win.

After doing this, I got all my ABP, but didn't get any of the XP or
the GP. Although this is definitely not "allowed" in the game, I
consider it a fair trade that doesn't compromise the integrity of
my play-through too much.

I then switch to Freelancers, got my Abilities all in line, and
then got the equipment from the store that I wanted. (Nice thing:
The chain whip is the most powerful weapon I have available right
now and it is also usable from the back row!)

This whole process took 8 minutes of game time, which I will count,
and about an hour and a half of programming time.

Total time: 15:00</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Video Games/">Video Games</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Final Fantasy 5/">Final Fantasy 5</a></li><li><a href="/cat/SNES/">SNES</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1992/">1992</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
