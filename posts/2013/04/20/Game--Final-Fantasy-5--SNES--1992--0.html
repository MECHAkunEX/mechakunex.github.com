and the PowerPak. This game was the first translation I ever heard
of or tried to play. I have a distinct memory of playing it when I
was very young on an early (bad) emulator with a bad PC
controller. When I played again, I remembered up until the ship
graveyard, but nothing really after that, even though I know I
played further.

The game is really interesting when compared to FF4 and FF6. It
really is just between them in lots of different ways and there's
a lot of shared content. For example, the graphics and art assets
between FF4 and FF6 are totally different, but I can see
sprites/etc in FF5 that are in both. (Examples: The mountains in
FF5 are used in FF6. The werewolf and dragon sprites are also
shared. Some of the monsters, in battle, are the same as FF4.)
Overall, I'd say that the overworld/map looks more like FF6 but
the UI/in-battle art looks more like FF4.

There are some convenience things that are more like one or the
other too. For example, you can "optimize" your equipment, but you
can't see if a weapon in a store is going to be better or
worse. Also, the L/R buttons don't switch between characters in
the menu sub-screens... which is really inconvenient.

Another interesting thing is to think about the characters... in
FF4 you have 5 characters at a time and a very large cast with
detailed interactions that cause them to move in and out of the
party. In FF6, its the same, but with only 4 at a time. FF5 is
totally different. You immediately get the 4 characters and they
never change. Furthermore, I find them to be relatively
blank-slate characters compared to those in FF4/6, and not only
because the job system makes them so flexible.

Finally, there are interesting references. The first one is that
in FF5e, you can let "Lone Wolf", a thief, out of jail. He, of
course, shows up in FF6.

On the actual game, I really like it. The story is fun and the
combat system is great. The job system is cool, especially the
beautiful sprites for each job. (I also like it how when a
character is downed in battle, they lose their outfit, like it was
a magical super-hero costume.) The system is quite overwhelming
though, it feels like it is really easy to make a bad choice with
what to do.

I played for a little less than seven hours and got up the Ancient
*REDACTED*rary. The only time I needed to grind was to beat Shiva.
