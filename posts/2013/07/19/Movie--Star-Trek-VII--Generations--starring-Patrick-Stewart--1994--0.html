This was a very confusing movie in the beginning, because I know
nothing about the new crew of the Enterprise and I felt that there
were a lot more references to their past, as opposed to the earlier
movies which seemed more modular vis-a-vis the TV series.

In particular, I'm confused about why there are no Vulcans,
although clearly Data is supposed to be like Spock.

The movie felt very similar to V in the middle, because we have a
guy, crazed, trying to get to a place of religious significance.

I don't get how the Borg are mentioned in this as doing something
in the distant past, when Captain Kirk should have been active. Is
there an original episode with the Borg too? I thought that was a
Picard thing.

Why are there tons of kids and civilians on the ship? During the
"separation scene", you see lots of them.

After watching seven movies, it seems so unbelievable that the
ships are so fragile and they are constantly breaking in many ways
and there are always "turbulence"-like problems where they are
being rocked back and forth. It seems so weird given the otherwise
technological superiority.

In this movie, it was crazy when the ship crashed... how could they
possibility get out of the situation and rebuilt the ship on a
primitive world? Although I guess it didn't look like that much
damage was done... until the whole planet was destroyed at
least. This has to be an "alternate" reality? I guess I failed to
remember that they could contact other people to help them.

It was intense to see Kirk die. I guess he was wrong though... he
didn't die alone.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/1994/">1994</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
