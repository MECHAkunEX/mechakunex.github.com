I've
heard a lot about this from my love of Bayonetta.

In the first three missions, I found it to be a pretty bad
game. It definitely feels like it was originally a Resident Evil
game, with the fixed, stuffy camera angles and the awkward
"adventure game" tropes throughout the castle.

I don't find the combat to be very fluid and I feel like it's
impossible to dodge at all, which means there's almost no
"finesse" to combat. It reminds me of a traditional 2D brawler
where the key is not to dodge, but to evenly spread out your
attacks against a lot of enemies to keep from getting
surrounded. It's definitely a coherent design, but I can't say I
really enjoy it.

The boss battle in the third mission was ridiculous. It felt like
you couldn't hit the thing at all. Eventually, I looked at a FAQ
and it said to dodge, but you can't really move quickly and then
whenever you try to move around the camera angle changes on you so
you turn around. It is infuriating. In the end, I just tried to
spam jump on its back over and over. I'm kind of amazed that I was
able to beat it the time that I did, because it didn't feel any
different on my part from before. I died maybe... 10 times and did
a few different reloads before I won. I felt like just quitting
and saying the game wasn't for me. But since I won, I guess I will
keep going. I'm not excited about it though.

I find the need to hold R1 to use the gun to be very annoying. I
can appreciate its unique "stick shift"-like quality, but it
doesn't feel beautiful or good to me.
