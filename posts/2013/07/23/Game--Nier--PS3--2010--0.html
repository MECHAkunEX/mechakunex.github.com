I got
up to the part where you go to the military base. The game is so
weird. It feels like it came from another planet. The introduction
is so abrupt and a lot of the dialogue is incredibly bizarre. The
mechanics are really odd too. Obviously there's the weird fishing
game, which I totally failed at.

But, the most interesting thing to me is when a battle scene pulls
out to an almost 2D perspective and it feels like a bullet hell
shooter where you have to weave your way through geometric
patterns. The boss inside the military base was really cool in
that way.

The style of the game is exceedingly odd too. The main character
is so ugly. The girl Kaine is such a cliche, it feels like
pandering, but then the characters acknowledge that she's
pandering. It's weird. I was really annoyed that I just turned on
the game and within seconds heard almost every cuss word
around. I've been playing with the voice volume off, but haven't
actually heard anything bad.

I get the feeling that there's a huge amount of content I'm
missing by not being meticulous enough with the environments and
quests. I feel like every shop has stuff that appears useless and
is definitely too expensive to be worthwhile.

I am really annoyed at how far all the places I need to go between
are. It would be different if it were a normal RPG where you were
gaining power through the fights, but the progression in this game
seems incredibly slow. Not only are you gain levels very slowly,
but I feel like gaining a new level never matters.

It feels like the game defies you at every step and is just a
stumbling block. It's bizarre.

My final comment for the day... it is totally absurd that there
are two versions of this game in Japan and that the character
design is a Western cliche. I think the Japanese one looks a lot
better.
