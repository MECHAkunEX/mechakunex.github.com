I focused pretty
heavily on the core work of the game and made it mostly through
the Denver stage (I think). 

I'm mastering the game a lot more... I've discovered that when you
are cutting off left arms, it is best to aim yourself, but when
you are doing a Ninja Kill, etc, it is best to just use the
Square/Triangle buttons to get an immediate one.

There's lots of stuff I'm clearly missing, because I will get VR
Mission 9 and then 12. I want to play it again anyways, so that's
fine, but it's a bit annoying to think that I've looked everywhere
but have actually missed some stuff.

This game is still great.

In the evening I played for about three hours. I played through
the rest of outside the tower and then the inside, so I fought the
Sundowner guy, who has seemed like the big bad most of the
time. In the fight outside the tower with Monsoon, I finally got
the Parry system down. The key was to realize that it was much
faster than I thought and that you could parry while being hurt
and stunned. Now I feel like I can take on anything.

The fight with Sundowner was intense, but I think I did it the
slow way, because I didn't get off all his armored plates by the
end. The sequence going up the tower was pretty crazy.

I'm a bit surprised that the child-soldier-brain-extraction thing
seems to be /the/ plot, whereas I had originally assumed it would
just be the prelude to something else.

I'm starting to complete some of the upgrade trees, I wonder if
I've missed hidden stuff in the levels?

The opening of the next chapter was pretty nuts... jumping out of
a helicopter onto a jet flying by... very cool.
