Spelunky. It has been on my mind since I first saw a trailer for
it a few years before it came out. Brad on the Giantbombcast had a
lot of good things to say about it, so I was excited to try it out
eventually.

I played for a little more than two hours and my first impressions
of the game were good. The graphics are beautiful. The voice
acting is not horrific, but not amazing either so I'm tending to
just read the subtitles and skip to the next piece of text. The
world is very interesting and doesn't feel to "same-y".

I'm playing on Hardcore mode and the combat feels pretty tight
and fun. It's very comparable to Muramasa, except I feel like
this game doesn't have as much to offer and doesn't have any
complex/interesting mechanic like the sword strength
maintenance. I haven't found the Fidget attacks to be very
useful, so the game is really just attacking with the sword and
dodging for me. Since I'm on Hardcore, I basically cannot get hit
a single time or I will die. (I have 80 HP and most attacks do
about 120 HP damage right now.) This has the bonus of making it
so there is no point to using healing items because everything is
a one-hit kill anyways.

So far I've only seen four types of monsters and they are
basically all fodder if you pay a little bit of attention to
where they are and dodge properly.

The speed of the game is good when you are progressing into new
areas, but when you are going back to old areas it is very
painful because the movement is just too slow when you know where
you are going.
