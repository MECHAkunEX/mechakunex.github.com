After less than an
hour, I had unlocked the Ice Caves short-cut. Within 15 minutes, I
had gotten to the Temple twice. I found the Ice Caves to be pretty
easy, but also really random. Since it is so vertical and open,
you can pretty easily jump right to the end. This means for me
that it isn't really worth it to open up the short-cut, although
it is painful to go through. After another thirty minutes or so, I
got to Olmec but didn't realize where his hit box is or something
and died right away. (I only had 1 HP anyways.) After another
thirty minutes or so I got back and did him in. I like that he's
basically Bowser from Super Mario Brothers 3.

Overall, I had 209 attempts. I know that there's another way to
beat the game (by going through all the secret areas) but I don't
love the game enough to do it. (That's why I marked it as not
completed.) Maybe I haven't played long enough to truly discover
it, but I feel like the game really doesn't have that much of
complex strategy. When I eventually won or got to Olmec, I wasn't
doing much different than the other times. There were lots of
really bizarre random chances. It's definitely fun, but not enough
fun to invest a ton more time into honing my skills. (On the other
hand, I've watched a few videos that show people dying and
starting again and they have amazing technique that is basically
perfect every time. So there's definitely something there, but I
don't want to achieve that level.)

I had a lot of fun with it and could imagine coming back to it if
I could have a tighter loop of getting into it. It would also be
awesome if the co-op were more effective for my situation.

Compared to Fez, which I just played, I think Spelunky is a
/better/ game but not a game that I love enough to beat it with
the absoluteness I did to Fez, which seems contradictory, but I
think makes sense if you think about it.
