I
made a lot of progress in the story of the game. I had lots of
frustrating rooms where the hardcore mode is really being a
pain. By comparing the game clock and my accounting, I can see
that I have spent 2 hours on runs that ended in me dying.

I think the worst room so far had nothing to do with hardcore mode
though: there's a room underground where there are no lights and
tons of platforms with spikes on the bottoms. You have to navigate
a bomb through it to light your way to gather some treasure. Since
the control you have over the bomb is so bad, it is likely to blow
up by hitting the platforms. I got the treasure three times before
I made it back out to the save point. So painful.

I'm continuing to like the game and still finding the combat to
very basic. A telling example was the boss of the underground
area. My strategy: jump at her, press X a few times, dash behind
her, repeat. I found no reason to do anything more complicated,
which I see as a flaw in the game.

I did the first two trials in the game and they were
interesting. Something I'm finding is that I can't tell if I am
getting anything valuable from doing quests. Also, when you are
buying equipment at the store, it doesn't show you what effect it
will have on your stats, so you have decide through some other way
(like by memorizing the stats of the current equipment) whether it
is a good purchase. Annoying.
