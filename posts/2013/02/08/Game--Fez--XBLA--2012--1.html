discoveries. I discovered the Tetromino code and got the Telescope
worked out. I was also able to use one of the pillars and do the
door room. Finding the Tetris code was awesome because there was
so much I could do with it. Just before I finished that session, I
found the Rosetta Stone of the alphabet... although so far I
haven't found any useful text.

Later in the day I played again and found the number code and then
got to the ancient city. (I had been exploring the world and never
going to back to the waterfall area.) Something funny happened, I
had already got 32 cubes before getting to the city and Dot said
something about going back to a door there. I explored it and
inadvertently beat the game. I was nervous when I saw New Game+,
because I didn't want to get everything again, but was glad that I
just got the sunglasses.

I played for another two hours and got a lot more, including the
many Tuning Forks. Right now I have just got through the Lava
area... which was terrifying. I don't have another key to use in
the Sewer, so I'm nervous that I'll to find my way back here.

I've continued to find the platforming to be fun and the puzzley
aspects of the game to be nice. I think the alphabet is a bit
over-kill because it is just so painful to translate anything. I'd
much prefer giving proof that I know what it means and then having
the game auto-translate or something.
