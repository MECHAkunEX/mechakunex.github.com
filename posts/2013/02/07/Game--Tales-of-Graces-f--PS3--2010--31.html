I ended with Asbel at level
80, which is crazy to me, because I was roughly that level after
getting to Zhonecage (after almost 100 hours) the first time. I
had 518 encounters in the New Game+, the total battle time was 48
minutes, which means the average battle length was 5.5 seconds!
It's also pretty amazing to me that only 9% of my play time was
fighting this time, especially because I skipped every cut-scene,
had 2x movement speed, and was just running from boss to boss.

I've decided that I'm done with the game. The only things left
that I could do is (a) get all the Carta cards, which would be
super tedious; (b) get the Turtlez Togz from the Dark Turtlez,
which would be super tedious; (c) get the Eleth Mixer to 9999,
which even checking out what apparently is the fastest way to do
it, would be crazy; and, (d) get the title trophies for the men,
which would probably be painful because it mean having lots of
battles and managing what skills they used.

This was a very fun game. The battle system is great and the story
is a lot of fun. The world is cool too. I think my only complaints
about it are very minor: the user interface on some things could
have been better. For example, being able to have sets of AI
settings for different situations, sets of mixer settings as well,
and being able to pick a result you wanted from the dualizing
system (that you had already discovered) rather than having to
remember the recipe in your head. The AI was also pretty
unreliable as a healer. I found that it almost never tried to
resurrect dead characters and if you told it to, then it was hit,
it would not remember what your last instruction was. This was
very annoying.
