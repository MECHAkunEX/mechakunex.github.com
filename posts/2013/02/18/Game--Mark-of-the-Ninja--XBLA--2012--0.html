It
is amazing. I love stealth games (actually, I've only really
played Metal Gear, so I guess I just love Metal Gear) and this
game is an /amazing/ stealth game. It is /so/ good at giving you
control over everything you need to do, who can see you, etc. It's
pretty awesome.

I played through four or five levels, getting 100% every time
(except the last one... I didn't find one scroll and I couldn't do
the hanging seal because I didn't have that technique
yet... bummer.) I did one level twice because I got 200 points
less than required for the third star. It's pretty amazing to
spend an hour on every level and love it. I'm very excited to
play more of it and experiment more.

The first outfit I earned was the Hunter and I just got the
Stealth one. I think I will try it out a bit. I feel like I'm
going to want to get a Platinum one this game.

In the afternoon, I played for another hour and a half and
repeated one level then did another one again. This game is /so/
much fun!

--

In the evening I played another two hours and did a few more
levels, including one without interacting with any enemies using
the Stealth Suit, which was awesome.  The last level I did, the
Inner Keep, was real tough, especially near the end and making
sure I got all the Seals. One annoying thing was that the
"natural" order to get the scrolls isn't 1, 2, 3, but 2, 1, 3, so
when I got the second, I assumed I had missed the first and did a
lot of wasteful back-tracking.  I got a lot of achievements some
how, but I'm not really sure what I did to get them. This game is
still pretty awesome.
