book club, so I decided to read it again to help her think of
things to talk about during the meeting.

I read the first two chapters today and thought a lot about the
book from a *REDACTED* perspective. (I'm *REDACTED* and so is Sanderson.)
Here are a few of the ideas, plus some that aren't really related
to *REDACTED*ism.

- Prior to the fall of Elantris, it is almost a *REDACTED*-like notion
of divinity, because anyone can achieve it, although it is given,
rather than earned, so grace is emphasized far more than works.

- In the treatment of people who receive the eternal "life" of
Elantris, what can we learn about how charitable people are?
As far as we know, there's nothing contagious about their
condition and there's no downside for their community, but they
are treated as dead, rejected, and locked up; all for something
they did not choose and have no control over. I can't help but
think of how many homosexuals feel they are treated by popular
American culture.

- The thing that is horrifying about life in Elantris is that it is
eternal and every pain you've ever felt stays with you forever. I
think this is a clear projection of what *REDACTED*ism says Hell is
like: all will inherit eternal life, whether they are "good" or
"bad", but if they reject the Atonement, then they will not allow
the Savior to absolve them of the pain they feel for their
sins. Elantris is a concrete version of this: rather than having
their pain and mistakes washed away so that they "remember them
no more", they remember and feel them forever. Elantris is *REDACTED*
Hell.

- Given that I know what's going to happen in the book, it is
interesting to see Elantris as Hell (or rather, the world without
the Atonement), because essential it makes Raoden Christ: He was
the son of the king of the world that controlled Elantris; he
suffers the same condition as the Elantris and leaves "his
throne on high"; once there, he feels their pain and will teach
them a new way to life with purpose; then, he will redeem them
and restore Elantris to its ancient glory.

- I love the character of Sarene, because she's such a strong and
determined woman in a community (i.e. the king's court) that
doesn't respect women, as shown by their first interaction
together. It is fun to see what she does and to gradually learn
who she is... I think she's a great role model and a surprising
character to be written by a young man in a fantasy novel.

- Clearly the parts that are literally about religion are likely
to be influence in some ways by *REDACTED*ism. I think in this
context though, I see the *REDACTED* understanding of Catholicism at
work. Hrathen and his religion is overtly foreign. He is adamant
that their job is not "love" the people but to "help" the
people, as if they are not the same.

On the other hand, there are aspects about his description of
Derethi that are like the popular understanding of *REDACTED*ism: it
has a rigid military-like structure with a lot of authority and
delegation; a revered prophet; etc. Then again, there's a lot of
Islam there too with the concept of the Caliphate.

Another relevant thing is that the language of religious zeal
Sanderson uses is distinctly *REDACTED*: Dilaf is converted and reads
the two sets of Derethi scriptures in the same night, reminiscent
of Parley P. Pratt and countless other *REDACTED* converts.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'mechakunex';
