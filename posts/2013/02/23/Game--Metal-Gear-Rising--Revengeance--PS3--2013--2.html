on the mission. I'm having some slightly annoying moments trying
to get the special arms from the commanders where I have to
restart from the last checkpoint so I can try again to get them. I
also found an exploit where I could keep getting a BP Holochip
over and over again, so I did that for a while to amass a huge
amount of BP to buy what I want going forward.

Since the game is bloody and against humans, I don't really want
to play it around my kids, so I'm not able to play it as much,
which is a little sad.

It's funny that I've already played it for longer more than it was
rumored to take in the days leading up to its release.

Later in the day I played for another hour and finished the first
big mission and then started the second. The intro to the second
was hilarious... Raiden in a giant sombrero. You can tell it has
that Metal Gear wackiness. Later in the level, there's this
strange kid from Guyana with a weird accent who thinks you're a
ninja and says "Go Ninja! Go Ninja! Go!" and "Cowabunga", like
TMNT.

Right when I met him though, was an insanely difficult fight with
three Raptor enemies. I played it maybe five times, each time
making almost no progress at all. On maybe the fourth time, I
noticed that I could get a ninja attack on them, so I tried
spamming that while parrying and dodging... and I beat them in
just a few seconds. Crazy. I thought I was going to have to
restart and getting some healing items or something.

This game definitely feels like a Platinum game, but it's really
unique compared to Vanquish or Bayonetta in what you're
doing... but it "feels" the same. It's great.

Before bed I played for about an hour and a half, I made it
through a few rooms. There was a really rough part with some of
the "Silverback" enemies where I had to Stealth-kill them because
they were too powerful to take on all at once, but it was very
hard to sneak up on the third one because he was up
high. Eventually I was able to do it because of a fluke: he fell
off but I didn't, so I hid in a box until the alarm went down
then I did a from-above-Stealth-kill.

The moment in the story of seeing all the detached brains is
CARAZY. Kojima has used child soldiers as a plot point before, but
this is even more bizarre. It's definitely effective for the story
beat it is going for.
