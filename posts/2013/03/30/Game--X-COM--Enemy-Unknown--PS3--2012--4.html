I did the Overseer
ship but the very next mission was really hard to do and I've
restarted it three or four times. There are two Sectopods right
away and it's very hard to get organized enough to take them
out. I bought an Alloy SHIV, but it doesn't seem to be very
reliable, since it can't take cover.

In the evening I played for about three hours and I beat the
game. I did one short mission (against a downed battleship, which
gave me a LOT of materials) and then I skipped missions until the
Gollop Chamber was made and I could go to the ending.

The final mission was pretty challenging, especially against the
Sectopods and the Mutons. The dialogue was pretty interesting,
although the whole game was incredibly anti-climatic. The final
room was trivial: I walked it with one character, she shot the
boss, then my sniper was in range and got a head-shot and killed
him. None of the enemies had any chance to react, so I didn't see
their powers in anyway. Some of the earlier fights were pretty
easy too, because the Rift attack is so powerful. (But they were
challenging to set up.) The resolution of the story was pretty
terrible too (not that I care too much about it... but they seemed
to)---the voice work was /so/ bad and they tried to express
emotion with these flat character models. The worst part though
was that they didn't resolve the interesting dialogue about the
purpose of the aliens at all.

Overall, I found the game to be really fun. Most of my complaints
are about the interface. I feel like you converge incredibly
quickly to knowing what the right strategy is and then the rest
of game is dealing with the fog of war and dealing with failed
shots because of random chance. Looking at it like that, it
doesn't feel very fun. And I think that's why I don't feel like I
want to play again right away. But I do like the mechanics so I
intend to play it again at some point, just not now.
