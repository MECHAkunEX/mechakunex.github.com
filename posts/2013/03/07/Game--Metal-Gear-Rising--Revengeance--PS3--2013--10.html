I mainly did VR
Missions. I did everything up to 17. After that I tried each and
said "It's not worth it" and stop. I almost gave up at 13 because
the sliders were so unforgiving, but once I used the Sai and
aerial attacks exclusively it was reasonable. 14 was really hard
too, because it seemed like you to go in the perfect order. 15
and 16 were really dumb. 15 was a waypoint where you run forward
and get knocked back by RPGs and then 16 was "stand-in-place and
shoot a turret". The VR Missions in general feel pretty
un-inspired and tedious to do... and even more tedious to try and
do 1st place on. Maybe it would be a bit easier to swallow if the
reload times weren't so bad.

With that, I'm done with the game. It was very enjoyable and the
combat system was pretty original and fun. I thought the story
was a fun little Metal Gear side-story: it doesn't really move
the whole universe forward, but it feels like it takes place in
the same place, which is cool. I don't think the game's combat
was as deep as Bayonetta or Vanquish, but it was unique and fun
in its own way. I'd definitely play it again in the future, but I
don't feel like I need to 100% it anymore.
