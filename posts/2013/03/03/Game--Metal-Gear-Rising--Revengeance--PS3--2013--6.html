last boss over and over. It was totally brutal. Eventually, I had
a good run and got him to 72.7%, then the next time (30 minutes+
later) my best was 91.9, and then after another 30 minutes or so,
I beat him. Ouch.

I thought the final boss was ridiculously hard and only slightly
unfair, particularly once I realized that you didn't actually have
to slice up the blocks he threw at you and could just avoid them.

Overall, I thought the story was neat and felt very "Metal Gear",
which I like. I thought the gameplay was amazing I intend to
continue playing it and trying to master it. It's really fun and I
think it will be even more fun once I free myself up a bit with
upgrades, etc. I think the biggest gameplay flaw was the camera
not staying on the target you've chosen and it being painful to
select a particular target.

I'm going to start replaying stuff and getting 100% on everything,
which I'll notate as "Game 2". I spent about 40 minutes creating
a TODO list of all the stuff I haven't got in the game and in
which level it was so I can more efficiently go back to the
correct level and do them to get the stuff. Some of them look
really intense to get.

Later in the day, I played for about two hours and played again
on Hard to start getting the stuff I missed. I got everything
(except Trophies) from the first three levels. I'm so much better
at the game now, it's a bit ridiculous.
