I did a lot of missions
trying to get the resources to get to the next level of the
game---building a ship and taking down the Overseer ship. I
started to have really bad injuries after most battles, forcing me
to expand my stable of troops.

I'm finding the combat to be very same-y: I know what I need to
do, almost algorithmically, and when it fails, it's almost always
because of the random number generator. Since you can't change the
outcomes by save scumming, you have to just reload and try
something slightly different (sometimes just doing the actions in
a different order) and you'll get the result you want. I feel like
as the game is progressing, the enemies are increasing in strength
at the same rate I am, so the difficulty has plateaued and there's
no new strategy to learn.

In the meta-game of managing the base, I feel so tightly
constrained by a lack of materials, there's almost nothing to
actually do. I spent some time making it so I could have tons of
satellites in the air. (In fact, in 10 days of game time, I will
have a satellite in every country.) One side-effect of that is
that I now have a ridiculous amount of money. Unfortunately it
doesn't really matter because I don't have enough Alloy, etc to
actually build anything. It makes me wish there were a way to buy
Alloy or purposefully go on a mission that would net you some.

I definitely still like the game and see a lot of good in it, but
as I continue to play, I am getting less and less enamored with
it and see more of its flaws.

The most glaring flaw is the horrible UI for modifying your troops
load outs. There's no easy way to make sure you are sending your
guys out with your best stuff. You need to manually go to every
other character that you aren't going to use and make sure to
de-equip them with everything. The game really needed to just show
you everything that was available in the menu and have it get
de-equipped when you selected it if it was in use, with perhaps
the constraint that you couldn't de-equip from people in the
active squad. That would do wonders for the experience of playing
the game.
