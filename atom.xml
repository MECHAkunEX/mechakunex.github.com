    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan&#8217;s Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight&#8230; including all four bottles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he&#8217;ll play himself some day and I&#8217;ll watch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary&#8217;s adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it&#8217;s now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn&#8217;t
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fascinating episode. I find Mrs. Crawley to be really
annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I&#8217;m proud of
Edith too, she&#8217;s been very nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I watched this in preparation for the sequel. It was
very interesting, especially by putting ourselves in the mindset of
someone from the 1980s. It&#8217;s fascinating how just 10 or so years
after the movie came out, consumer computers would have been able
to render the graphics in real-time.</p>

because I want to empty my queue. Tonight I played for a little
more two hours while watching YouTube videos. I did one of the
marble jump puzzles on my first try, it was awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The drama is on very quickly. I don&#8217;t like the idea of them using
the house for more to do with the war. I like the way its about
almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I&#8217;m appalled by Edith cheating
with a farmer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote in my calendar to check on the DLC about six months after
I beat the game, when presumably it would all have been
released. It has. I looked for information about it and almost
none of it seems interesting, except Lightning&#8217;s episode. But, I
found that it only takes about 25 minutes (including cut-scenes)
and that&#8217;s not worth 5 bucks, so I just watched it. The new ending
is neat. I&#8217;m excited for 13-3. I love this battle system so much
and I find the world to be really cool too. I hope it can be
efficient for them to produce, make them lots of money, and make
FF15 amazing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn&#8217;t move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don&#8217;t think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O&#8217;Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary&#8217;s backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it&#8217;s more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I&#8217;m still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I&#8217;m very curious
how the next season will go, because they&#8217;ve been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really intense episode. I really enjoyed the cuteness
between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years&#8230; at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.</p>

I beat it&#8212;after almost an hour&#8212;I was 1.02 seconds too late to
get an A+. I gave it another 15 minutes and got about 7 seconds
under the required time. Go!</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for another hour and a half later in the day beat a few
more levels. 5-19X was destroying me though. I have 5-19X, 5-20X,
Four Letter Word in Cotton Alley, and all the Dark World of
Dr. Fetus&#8217; castle and Cotton Alley left before I do everything in
the game. Exhausting. This game makes my hands hurt.</p>

going through Stone Man&#8217;s stage. I got to him and was doing pretty
well, but the Mega Buster wasn&#8217;t powerful enough against him. The
spinning things are the worst&#8230; they crowd you and you can&#8217;t

draw them away and then jump n shoot them.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/Movie&#8211;The-Lorax&#8211;by-Dr&#8211;Seuss&#8211;2012&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn&#8217;t see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.</p>

<p>The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he&#8217;s a bad businessman because he doesn&#8217;t have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O&#8217;Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.</p>

<p>I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There&#8217;s this
text:</p>

<p>David Edelstein: &#8220;the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk&#8221; &#8211; and
[in the movie] Ted says, &#8220;Wow, what does that even mean?&#8221; and
Audrey says, &#8220;I know, right?&#8221; So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss&#8217; sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don&#8217;t know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren&#8217;t making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!</p>
