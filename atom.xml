As if the last episode wasn't crazy enough. Yikes!

I liked the wandering scenes where everyone just got cozy with
each other and talked more. It was cute. The conversation with
Dany and Tyrion was really tense... it is interesting how she
really doesn't trust him but we totally do.

The capture of the wight was very interesting, because we now
know that a particular Walker controls a particular set of
wights. The fight was cool and the stand-off on the island was
really intense.

It was totally epic how Dany came in and saved them. As soon as
the Night King got out his spear, I immediately said, "Oh no,
zombie dragon!" It was so cool how Dany and Jon looked at each
other in the moment he sent her off. I couldn't believe that Jon
was really gone, so it made sense for Benjen to be the
deus-ex-machina.

It was really touching the way Dany wanted to wait for Jon, how
she took care of him, and saw his stab wounds. Emilia Clarke did
an amazing job communicating her love in those scenes.

I am very scared about the zombie dragon!

All the scenes with Arya and Sansa were extremely tense. I feel
like both of them are on the verge of doing something really
stupid, and Sansa has no idea just how powerful Arya is.

---

My prediction for the remaining episodes: (7) Figure out how to
meet with Cersei and catch-up on the other plot lines; (8) Have
the meeting with Cersei, she betrays them; (9) Dany crushes
Cersei; (10) The Night King attacks with the Zombie Dragon,
potentially shattering the Wall.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Muramasa Rebirth (Vita, 2013) (5)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/08/15/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--4.html"/><updated>2017-08-15T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/08/15/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--4.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/08/15/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--4.html">Game: Muramasa Rebirth (Vita, 2013) (5)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/08/">08</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/08/15/">15</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for a bit today and finished Momohime's story.

There were some really tense moments in this episode!

I like Bronn's explanation to Jaime that he saved him so he could
get rewarded, that strikes me as very much Bronn's style.

I don't think that Dany's offer to the soldiers is very wise,
given that they are unlikely to be loyal if their choice is
fealty or death. It was intense the way she burned them alive...
I wonder what we are meant to believe that the Lannister soldiers
will now do for her.

It is cool that Drogon lets Jon pet him. I feel like it must be
because he's really a Targaryen. I felt like Dany and Jon liked
each when they were departing. It was quite cute. I thought it
was odd that we never saw Theon or got an update on the Greyjoys.

I liked Jaime's practicality and I thought he was very wise. I
think that Cersei is not really pregnant and that she's trying to
manipulate Jaime. I'm surprised that the Mountain wasn't in the
episode.

I thought that it was slightly surprising that Bronn wouldn't
just switch sides and be with Tyrion, given that he doesn't think
that they can stand against dragons.

It was cool the way that Bran warged into a ton of ravens, but it
didn't really seem necessary. My brother-in-law suggested that
Bran will warg into the dragons to take them over later. I'm glad
that he has done something "useful" for the cause, even it was
just warning about the march.

Littlefinger's scheming is very sinister and I think it will
turn out to be very bad for Arya to have come back rather than
gone on to King's Landing. I think that Littlefinger wants Arya
to believe that he was doing Sansa's work, but my immediate
assumption was that he was not really doing that.

It was neat to have Gendry back and his hammer was awesome. (I
recall that his father also used a hammer.) I find it slightly
hard to believe that he's been training in fighting though. I
wonder how Dany would feel about him, given what King Robert did
to her family. I wonder if he will become the new Lord
Baratheon. It's funny that their fathers "fought together" given
that Robert killed Rhaegar.

The scene in the North with everyone in the cell was really
great. It's so the style of this show for everyone to have tons
of weird connections and most of the time they never really talk
about them. (Like Jorah being healed by Sam, if he told Jon that
it would have been good, same with if Dany told him that she
killed Sam's kin.)

I think the Wight hunt is a really bad idea. I don't feel like it
is going to be that useful, because they can easily just crush
Cersei anyways. Plus I think there is a major risk that the Wight
will be able to infect others or something and get loose.

The situation in Oldtown was very depressing. I wonder if Sam
will actually learn anything with the scrolls and books he
stole. It was really interesting to learn that Jon is actually
the true born heir, although it seems like no one can ever know,
except for maybe Bran. I like that Sam quotes his father. It's
funny that Sam ignores Gilly on such an important thing too.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Muramasa Rebirth (Vita, 2013) (4)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/08/12/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--3.html"/><updated>2017-08-12T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/08/12/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--3.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/08/12/Game--Muramasa-Rebirth--Vita--2013--3.html">Game: Muramasa Rebirth (Vita, 2013) (4)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/08/">08</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/08/12/">12</a></span></span><pre class="content">I made it to the next boss area.

That was SO amazing. Wow. My heart was RACING at the end. It
was crazy.

The scene with Littlefinger and Bran was pretty intense, because
Bran is acting so weird. You want him to rally up and save his
family, but he doesn't seem to be doing anything with his
power. I was particularly saddened by how he treated Meera. I
almost expected him to say that he didn't "need" her but "wanted"
her there. But, no.

It was poetic how Arya had a hard time getting back in, just like
when she tried to get into King's Landing so long ago. Talking
about "her list" was very cool. I get the feeling that Bran wants
Arya to go back to kill Cersei... I certainly do. There's very
little for her to do up here. I think it was unwise for her to
reveal that she was a ninja, especially in the presence of
Littlefinger.

It is interesting that Cersei is considering hiring the Golden
Company, because they worked for Stannis, right?

The conversations between Jon and Dany were awesome. I get the
feeling they are starting to like each other, which would be so
perfect because they are both Targaryens and are both among the
only good people in the show. It was very cute when Davos said
he'd switch sides and join Dany.

Urggh... Theon. Argh...

The fight at the end was so amazing. I loved the terror in the
Lannister troops' eyes. I loved the way that the Dothraki were
just so much better---the guy's comment, "Your people can't
fight." Yikes. The dragon blasts were incredible. The fear and
nervousness was amazing. I think they did a great job when Bronne
was stumbling around, you really felt like one of the soldiers
with no idea what was happening or where to turn. The way that
the burned soldiers are instantly ash right in front of their
eyes... wow. I was very nervous when Dany was about to be
hit. From the perspective of Dany, this is the best result
though, because she now knows that there is some offensive that
is possible and so she can prepare better for it.

The very final moments... wow. It was especially beautiful to
have Tyrion wish Jaime safety.

--

In reading the wiki, I realize that Gendry's actor is listed as
starring... so he's coming back this season! Wow!

It was interesting that Bronne didn't go after his gold and run,
but stayed and fought. It is particularly interesting, because he
is kind of loyal to people on all the sides: Tyrion, Jaime, and
Poddrick.
