I played for about three. I spent the whole time unlocking places
in the Shuttle and doing side quests. A lot of the side quests
don't seem to be as meaningful as I was hoping, but the story
tidbits are interesting. I enjoyed the puzzles in the Sandshroud
Ruins; I enjoyed the play; I enjoy Pascal's ridiculous groping
animation whenever possible; Katz Korner is crazy; etc. Some of
the story bits are harder to appreciate because they have no
voice, which is only odd because the rest of the game does. I
think I'm getting towards the end of the side quests, and thus
I'll go to the end of the game soon.

Astue after getting the attachment for the shuttle. I'm excited to
be able to use the Shuttle to go anywhere I want. When we were in
the military base, the block puzzles were a little bit annoying in
their opaqueness. The scene at the end with Pascal making things
was great ("Yaay for me!") and especially when she made rings and
Cheria said, "Are you and Malik engaged?" Very cute.

Later in the day, I played another three-ish hours. I got the
Shuttle fully under my control and went to do the swimsuit quest,
the turtlez headquarters, and the shuttle crash site. The crash
site was very interesting. The fight in the Cocoon against
Richard was very tough, but I did it on Evil difficulty. I used
so many Life Bottles that I only had one left for Emeraude, so I
had to drop the difficult down a bit (to Hard) to beat her. It
was so tough.

I made
it to the other planet, but haven't talked to anyone yet. I
thought the movie as the characters were launching to the other
planet was pretty awesome... particularly Fourier's army. I like
how much mystery there is around the other planet, the ring around
the planet the characters are from, etc. Although, I dislike how
little the characters seem to be reacting to the idea that there
is another planet, more people, etc.

It's been very tough to not have Sophie in the party. I've
decided to drop down the difficulty level to Evil, since no one
else can heal as effectively as she can. This is a little tough
for me, because (something I forgot to mention I liked yesterday)
the higher difficulties give you benefits. (As opposed to a game
like Persona, where the higher difficulty levels just punish you
and for you to grind more.)

Exploring the Snowshroud Ruins was a little ridiculous because all
the switches had the worst initial placement. It was almost absurd
how predictable it was that they'd be in the wrong place.

In Telos Astue, I noticed a typo in a skit subtitling: it said
"my" rather than "may" when Hubert was speaking.

--

I played for another almost two hours and explored through the
first dungeon on Fodra. I got Sophie's memories back, but they
weren't too exciting because I had already guessed most
everything. The biggest revelation was that Cornell really made
Lambda and there's something sinister about his creation and
Fodra.

--

After church, I played for an hour and got to Bathus Citadel. The
monsters on the way were tough because they could turn you to
stone and then kill you very quickly. Once I got used to
targeting them fast, it was much easier though.

Fendel Tower. After my experience on the mountain, I had enough
strength to totally cream most enemies today---including the Lab
boss on Chaos! I'm starting to run out of titles to acquire and
I'm starting to master old ones. I really enjoy the naming
convention on the Amarcians: Fermat, Pascal, Fourier, Gauss. :)

Later in the day, I played for another three hours and go to
before going to World's Eye. Although I'm a bit confused, because
I forgot there was a port in Zhavert... although I guess that's
how I got there? I had a very tough time with the enemies on
Chaos in the ice cave. I also decided to specifically try to get
my characters to use more attacks to gain Adept and Master titles
for them.

After my kids went to bed, I played for another hour and half. I
got to where the Shuttle is, but haven't taken the detour to
Lhant yet. I was very proud of my fight against Richard, because
I was able to beat him on Evil. (I got creamed on Chaos.) I
progressed the story a bit and went on the shipwreck side-quest
in Oul Raye, but died because of stupid Hubert. It's really
annoying to not have Sophie in my party, because she's an
essential part of my strategy and I've been using her the whole
time. This sequence of the game is a bit annoying in the amount
of running around you need to do. It feels like I spend more time
walking to a place than being there are fighting/learning about
the story.

After such a long day playing, I reflected a bit on the game. I
really like the story as an avenue for the characters to
interact. I think my favourite character is Pascal. They really
sell the way she acts and I like the way they don't have to have
pseudo-science explanations, because she just uses terms like
"thingamajigger" and such. It's cute.

I really enjoy the combat system. If I were playing on a
different difficulty level, I could imagine feeling it was boring
and rote, but because I have it at the maximum... it is pretty
stressful and requires a nice rhythm to it. I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable with it at the moment, because I'm trying to go
outside my comfort zone to get different titles for Asbel, but
it's still good. It's pretty awesome.

It's is practically without
dialogue for huge stretches and its setting is virtually without
compare. It feels incredibly realistic, although I don't really
have any way to verify that. I'm kind of amazed that it was made.

I think the most crazy part was when the lady is nearly drowning in
the pit and happens to give birth because the fall "shocked" her
into it. It was a little bit too crazy, but it worked in the story.

The movie was far more gory than it needed to be, but I think I
understand why Gibson designed it that way.

It's cool that at the core it is a "chase" movie.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2006/">2006</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Grey, starring Liam Neeson (2012)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/01/16/Movie--The-Grey--starring-Liam-Neeson--2012--0.html" /><updated>2013-01-16T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/01/16/Movie--The-Grey--starring-Liam-Neeson--2012--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/01/16/Movie--The-Grey--starring-Liam-Neeson--2012--0.html">Movie: The Grey, starring Liam Neeson (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/01/">01</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/01/16/">16</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a very stirring movie.

that they didn't have a cliche scene that would save Ottway and
give him faith in God. I think it is better that he did it himself.

The movie had way too much swearing, but I think the characters

I got to the Amarcian
Enclave and verified my hypothesis that Pascal is really an
Amarcian and that there are few left. When we got there, it was
interesting that one of the people said that we were people from
"the world below"---meaning they are in the sky. I had previously
assumed that they were underground. I wonder if the weird ring you
sometimes see in the sky is one of their creations or something?

There were some funny moments today in the skits. I enjoyed one
where Sophie said her favourite food was Crablettes (Crab
Omelettes) and Malik couldn't get a word in edgewise about the
food he liked. There was another where Hubert said that Cheria
was dressed indecently and he couldn't believe how much of her
thigh was revealed in combat. It was very funny to have two react
to that situation. :)

Gameplay-wise, I unlocked the Chaos difficulty. It is incredibly
hard. Almost every random battle can take me out. I think I
should camp on Mt. Zhavert for a bit and get up some
levels. There was a time when I had to beat one enemy at a time
and then run back to the Save Point because I was so nervous
about dying and losing progress. (I died maybe... six times in
that area.) When I fought the Boar boss at the end, I did pretty
well on Chaos, but ultimately dropped it to Evil to do it.

I did the whole first set of the Shot Cube puzzle game. It's
pretty fun.

I
got to the first town in Fendel. It's interesting how Fendel is
basically a cross between Russia and Germany.

I'm really enjoying all of Pascal's crazy dialogue; she's
actually funny. There was also a great skit with Sophie where she
thought she recognized peaches: once everyone was excited, she
said they reminded her of little butts. ;)

I've decided to go back through earlier parts of the game and
write down all my pending requests so I can keep an eye on them.

Along the way, I decided to complete the Arena---although I did
it only Easy. The last boss was really tough.

Later in the day,
I spent about an hour on Stage 47 and didn't beat it.

Stage 46 --- This level was super tough to get the various pieces
of the timing down. The Napalm shooting tanks roughly half-way
through were the worst, then the Longai-O at the end was pretty
tough.

Stage 47 --- This level took a few tries to get to the end, but
now I can get to the end without even thinking. It's so
frustrating and unfair though, because I spend about three
minutes getting a chance at the final boss... who kills me in 5
seconds. It's ridiculous. I don't have any opportunity to even
practice and learn in a meaningful way. It almost makes me want
to not do it, it's so insulting. Ugh!

It's very painful to do over and over again with no progress. At
least it doesn't take very long?
