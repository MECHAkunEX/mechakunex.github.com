    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a long drive today, so I played for almost four hours. I&#8217;ve
had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game&#8230; they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she&#8217;d be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said &#8220;until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die&#8221; instead of
&#8220;until death do you part&#8221;&#8230; thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I made a lot of progress and saved the kingdom. It was
fun. I started exploring the new continent. I had a really hard
time with fighting the giant cat. I could tell there was some
trick but couldn&#8217;t tell what it would be. It was annoying to have
no clue. I played for like two hours.</p>

through the next few adventures and now I&#8217;ve escaped from the
slave camp and I&#8217;m trying to get Coburg back in order. I really
enjoy the story in this Dragon Quest. It does a really good job of
making you feel like your dad is really strong and cares about
you. It&#8217;s neat. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of cute foreshadowing
going on too.</p>

with your dad, etc. It&#8217;s very adorable and heart-warming. I
especially like all the little jokes about how he can&#8217;t read. The
game-play is exactly what you&#8217;d expect and fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some reason I had lower expectations for this movie than recent
super hero movies I&#8217;ve seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning&#8230; like when he jumped on the grenade&#8230; and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn&#8217;t really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I&#8217;m excited to see The Avengers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend&#8217;s commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too&#8230; like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning&#8230; it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stupidity continues: (pg 188) [The context is that the pioneers
don&#8217;t often win in technology.] &#8220;Palm Computing did not pioneer the
personal digital assistant; Apple did&#8221; (and clearly Palm has won in
that industry.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how &#8220;smart&#8221; the &#8220;great&#8221;
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can&#8217;t
really go into that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My initial assumption about this book is that it will be full of
trite junk anecdotes mixed with pseudo-scientific statistics. (N =
11!)</p>

<p>After reading the first 15 pages and learning of the research
methodology, I expect that they&#8217;ve been duped by the Black Swan
problem: they paid attention to the random successes and ignored
the large number of failures that implemented similar policies.</p>

<p>Pointed comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 5) &#8220;We believe that almost any organization can substantially
improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great,
if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we&#8217;ve
uncovered.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>This sentence sounds like it says something meaningful, but
really it says nothing because if you fail after taking the
advice maybe you weren&#8217;t &#8220;conscientious&#8221; enough and even then
they say &#8220;almost any&#8221; and make no promise about becoming
great. Not that I think they could, but they don&#8217;t make very
large claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 7) One of the &#8220;companies&#8221; we should imitate is Fannie Mae!
Give me a break! The secret to success appears to be securing
government favour! You too can amass a net income of -16.9
billion USD ten years after becoming an example of a &#8220;Great&#8221;
company. I should throw the book out right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similarly, we have the wonderful, and bankrupt Circuit City.</p>

<ul>
<li>(pg 13) Lincoln is used as an example of a &#8220;humble&#8221; leader,
despite the atrocities he committed and dictatorial power he
seized. Nice.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the plane ride, I played this for a bit after my son fell
asleep. I was hoping he&#8217;d play it but he is having a hard time
learning to run in a direction and doesn&#8217;t have the patience yet.</p>

<p>When I played, I got to the Birdo in 7-1 but didn&#8217;t beat it. I
took the warps in 1-2 and 4-1 and then played through. I got 23%
of the game done. I think this version is quite a bit easier
because of the abundance of extra lives and hearts. But I like the
percentage indicator to show how much you&#8217;ve conquered.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a fine little romance. The most interesting thing about it
is how this, and other movies (like the Chaplin biopic) rewrite the
history of the Communist/Hollywood controversy of the 50s to play
out the way that modern Hollywood people wish that it would. It
makes me think that maybe some people wouldn&#8217;t realize that
Hollywood didn&#8217;t really &#8220;win&#8221;. There&#8217;s a lot of Hollywood
dopey-eye-ism in the movie, actually. It reminds me a lot of
Hugo.</p>

<p>I think the movie might have been improved by making it more
ambiguous about whether Jim Carrey really lost his memory.</p>

<p>The reviews are interesting. I think Roger Ebert saw what it was
going for and believed in it. The speech at the end was a bit too
dopey for my taste.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My little sister wanted to watch this movie tonight, so we watched
it together. I thought it was very cool and pretty trippy. I don&#8217;t
think Johnny Depp was very good in it though&#8230; he was too much
like <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow, but looked really weird and had a funny
voice. The slight attraction between him and Alice was creepy
too. I think I liked Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway the
best, they were just so odd. It was cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the blend of Western and Sci-Fi style. I was glad
that the aliens had a sensible purpose for being on Earth. I liked
that there was a deeper world in the background, but that it was
not too tantalizing (for a movie like this.) I thought the aliens
looked cool and Daniel Craig was super tough. The juxtaposition,
though, was the best part. All-around a good time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had heard a little about this movie when it came out, but nothing
really special. My parents wanted to watch a movie together and I
saw this on Amazon and suggested it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the movie. It&#8217;s very much unlike anything else in
its grand scheme. Maybe a little bit like Stargate. It takes a
little while to get started, but once it does, the pay-off is
great. I think what I like most about it is the way it spins a
world so well.</p>

<p>It makes me very interested in reading the series of books.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I rarely see movies in the theatre, but I was very interested in
seeing this, so we took the opportunity of free babysitting and
went out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Spider-Man super-fan, but I am familiar with the comic
book mythos enough to really appreciate this movie.</p>

<p>I like the structure of the plot and I really like the interaction
of Gwen and Peter. In the Toby McGuire movies, they weren&#8217;t
adorable enough together, but this movie does a good job of giving
them lots of awkward moments. I think Emma Stone really makes
it. She&#8217;s got a beautiful face too, which is nice for all the
close-ups they give the couple.</p>

<p>I quite like the development of Pete&#8217;s understanding of being
Spider-Man and I found the moment on the bridge to be really
emotional, as well as the crane scene.</p>

<p>I thought they did some good work establishing room to work in a
new franchise. There are cameos of The Daily Bugle, Peter&#8217;s
technique of taking pictures for it, Flash, as well as the central
focus of Oscorp.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the childishness of Peter: talking on his cell
phone, pranking on the villains, etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched about half of this movie with my parents. I missed the
beginning. It was pretty stupid with lots of very phoned-in
dialog and plot. In some ways it is like &#8220;This Means War&#8221;, in terms
of what the basis of the jokes are. I don&#8217;t think Meg Ryan can play
an insanely &#8220;hot&#8221; lady, although she&#8217;s definitely good
looking. Selma Blair is great, but her &#8220;sexy&#8221; scene is really
forced. The finale at the museum is pretty clever, but overall I
can understand why it was direct-to-DVD.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For about a month I&#8217;ve been working on 5-14X (Necrosis). It was
very, very hard. You had to go down a shaft, across a wide area
with tiny platforms, then up a shaft, back down, back across, back
up, and then across the same area but now with disappearing
platforms. All while being pursued by floating monsters and all
the shafts had maggot piles getting you.</p>

<p>Today I was playing with my son and after about 15 minutes of
doing okay, I say, &#8220;Well, I think this should be the last try
before we go to church.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Okay! Let&#8217;s DO it!&#8221; Then, of
course, I do it. I just needed a cheerleader.</p>

<p>I got 38.00 seconds when the par time was 60.00 seconds.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Katniss destroying the Holo was pretty stupid.</p>

<p>Woah, Prim dying with the same trap that Gale was talking about.</p>

<p>Katniss awakening in a hospital and not really being involved in
capturing Snow is disappointing.</p>

<p>Snow&#8217;s conversation with Katniss: very believable.</p>

<p>Appalling that Katniss would initiate more Hunger Games. Although,
since they never talked about it happening, I wonder if it did
given that Coin was killed?</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the books and thought they ended well. I thought
the second book and the first part of the third were the high
points for the series.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I played for a little less than three hours and finished
the game. I went through the Catacombs and then to the final
boss. I beat the Pinwheel boss and Nito on my first try. After I
got back to the Firelink Shrine, it took me a long time to figure
out that I just needed to jump down the pit to get back to the
Lordvessel. I did it the first time very nervously. I fought the
boss once and got creamed, then did a few of the upgrades I could
on my gear and then went back and beat him on my second try. After
I watched the ending, I had a big&#8230; that was it? Just explode
into the flame?</p>

<p>&#8211; Review &#8211;</p>

<p>This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It&#8217;s exactly like Demon&#8217;s Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon&#8217;s Souls.</p>

<p>I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could&#8217;ve been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren&#8217;t a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.</p>

<p>The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I&#8217;m undead, there&#8217;s a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don&#8217;t really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls story was very
coherent.</p>

<p>The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it&#8217;s all interconnected. It&#8217;s very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly &#8220;level&#8221;-y.</p>

<p>I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon&#8217;s. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don&#8217;t
think it really evolved that much.</p>

<p>The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn&#8217;t even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last&#8230; maybe I
just found a better farming spot.</p>

<p>The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon&#8217;s, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don&#8217;t really find the
game that difficult&#8230; just a good challenge&#8230; like Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon&#8217;s. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks&#8212;about the same
amount of total days, I think.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the game. But, I won&#8217;t be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I&#8217;d really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.</p>
