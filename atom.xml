to do these boss fights over and over to get perfects, including
the levels because you can't jump to the boss. Ouch.

last boss over and over. It was totally brutal. Eventually, I had
a good run and got him to 72.7%, then the next time (30 minutes+
later) my best was 91.9, and then after another 30 minutes or so,
I beat him. Ouch.

I thought the final boss was ridiculously hard and only slightly
unfair, particularly once I realized that you didn't actually have
to slice up the blocks he threw at you and could just avoid them.

Overall, I thought the story was neat and felt very "Metal Gear",
which I like. I thought the gameplay was amazing I intend to
continue playing it and trying to master it. It's really fun and I
think it will be even more fun once I free myself up a bit with
upgrades, etc. I think the biggest gameplay flaw was the camera
not staying on the target you've chosen and it being painful to
select a particular target.

I'm going to start replaying stuff and getting 100% on everything,
which I'll notate as "Game 2". I spent about 40 minutes creating
a TODO list of all the stuff I haven't got in the game and in
which level it was so I can more efficiently go back to the
correct level and do them to get the stuff. Some of them look
really intense to get.

Later in the day, I played for about two hours and played again
on Hard to start getting the stuff I missed. I got everything
(except Trophies) from the first three levels. I'm so much better
at the game now, it's a bit ridiculous.

Compare: "Hrathen would ever bear the scars of what he had done,
but it was better that one man suffer than an entire nation
continue in heresy." (Elantris, p203) vs "Behold the Lord slayeth
the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that
one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish
in unbelief." (1 Nephi 4:13)

Given that I know what will happen in the end, it is exciting to
see the foreshadowing (and foreboding) about the deadly monks of
the East. It's very cool.

Another way to look at what Raoden is doing in Elantris: Since he
giving everyone something to do and their lack of anything to do
was making them miserable, in a sense he is saying that if you (a)
live forever, (b) don't change/grow, and (c) don't have anything to
do, then you will be miserable. This is interesting from a *REDACTED*
perspective, because that describes perfectly what non-*REDACTED*
Heaven is like, whereas in the *REDACTED* concept of Heaven, everyone
has purpose and growth, and thus, according to /Elantris/,
happiness.

I really enjoyed how Raoden "converted" Taan with love and
reminding him of the beauty of the world.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Argo, starring Ben Affleck (2012)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html">Movie: Argo, starring Ben Affleck (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/28/">28</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a powerful movie.

short: Escape from Denver had four fights, I think, and the next

suddenly realized it was part of the earlier Denver stage but
backwards so it looked different. I remember Kamiya saying they
did that with Bayonetta too.

The fight with Sam was pretty cool and the parrying technique
wasn't trivial to implement. In general, my parrying is so good
now that I can take on numerous enemies of a type where one would
have brought me down before.

It was cool to see Sunny.

I like the discussion of the holy language of Jaddeth and where
converts should have to learn it. I think there's something similar
in *REDACTED*ism and English because all translations have to made from
English because the source of the Book of *REDACTED* is not available.

I like the discussion of using the Seons in Jaddeth's empire. It
is reminiscent to me of Islamic fundamentalists using technology
for their military purposes, yet claiming that technology designed
for improving people's lives is immoral.

I like that when Raoden meets with Karata the revelation is that
children are the greatest happiness in life and all toil is worth
it if you can take care of them.

My wife had the brilliant idea to see each of the characters as a
different model of leadership. Raoden has optimism and can give
people hope, by putting them to productive ends. Hrathen and
Sarene are both calculating and political, but I think they
represent those skills being put towards bad and good ends, so
they are interesting exemplars.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Expendables 2, starring Everyone Awesome (2012)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-27T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html">Movie: The Expendables 2, starring Everyone Awesome (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/27/">27</a></span></span><pre class="content">This movie is better in many ways than the first one.

pessimistic and negative towards having kids (despite Chris Rock's

performances, which seems wrong.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2010/">2010</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PS3, 2013) (4)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/24/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--3.html" /><updated>2013-02-24T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/24/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--3.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/24/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--3.html">Game: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PS3, 2013) (4)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/24/">24</a></span></span><pre class="content">This morning I played for about three hours. I focused pretty
heavily on the core work of the game and made it mostly through
the Denver stage (I think). 

I'm mastering the game a lot more... I've discovered that when you
are cutting off left arms, it is best to aim yourself, but when
you are doing a Ninja Kill, etc, it is best to just use the
Square/Triangle buttons to get an immediate one.

There's lots of stuff I'm clearly missing, because I will get VR
Mission 9 and then 12. I want to play it again anyways, so that's
fine, but it's a bit annoying to think that I've looked everywhere
but have actually missed some stuff.

This game is still great.

In the evening I played for about three hours. I played through
the rest of outside the tower and then the inside, so I fought the
Sundowner guy, who has seemed like the big bad most of the
time. In the fight outside the tower with Monsoon, I finally got
the Parry system down. The key was to realize that it was much
faster than I thought and that you could parry while being hurt
and stunned. Now I feel like I can take on anything.

The fight with Sundowner was intense, but I think I did it the
slow way, because I didn't get off all his armored plates by the
end. The sequence going up the tower was pretty crazy.

I'm a bit surprised that the child-soldier-brain-extraction thing
seems to be /the/ plot, whereas I had originally assumed it would
just be the prelude to something else.

I'm starting to complete some of the upgrade trees, I wonder if
I've missed hidden stuff in the levels?

The opening of the next chapter was pretty nuts... jumping out of
a helicopter onto a jet flying by... very cool.

thoughts.

- The contrast between Dilaf's zealotry and Hrathen's practicality
is very interesting. For example, Dilaf says something like
"Nothing can stand in Jaddeth's way" as an argument against why
they should do some plan for the Kae. Hrathen's response is,
"Then why isn't the whole world converted?" One idea I can see in
this is that often the "sophisticated theology" of the
upper-class of religionists make them have almost totally
different beliefs than the lower-class, to the point that the
upper-class may not even seem like they believe at all. I get
this impression about *REDACTED*ism a lot when people talk about how
to treat new converts, especially those in far away places.

- Hrathen gives a very *REDACTED* explanation of the Svarkiss: "Nothing
is more bitter than a soul who had had its chance and thrown it
away." This is the way that Satan and his followers are discussed
a lot in *REDACTED*ism and how many ex-members are seen.

- A poignant moment in one of Raoden's chapters is the discussion
of how Elantris was not built for normal people to live
in---there are no wells or furnances or lights---and that after
the fall of AonDor it is totally desolate. How is this related to
Modern worry about a too heavy reliance on technology and the
desire to train ourselves to live without in times of disaster?

- I like that Sarene's plan to change the government is so
libertarian and capitalistic. You can almost see the debate on
what to do as a debate about how to intervene in communist
countries and/or get them to change for the better. Freedom
works.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PS3, 2013) (3)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/23/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--2.html" /><updated>2013-02-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/23/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--2.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/23/Game--Metal-Gear-Rising--Revengeance--PS3--2013--2.html">Game: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PS3, 2013) (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this morning for about three hours and made some progress
on the mission. I'm having some slightly annoying moments trying
to get the special arms from the commanders where I have to
restart from the last checkpoint so I can try again to get them. I
also found an exploit where I could keep getting a BP Holochip
over and over again, so I did that for a while to amass a huge
amount of BP to buy what I want going forward.

Since the game is bloody and against humans, I don't really want
to play it around my kids, so I'm not able to play it as much,
which is a little sad.

It's funny that I've already played it for longer more than it was
rumored to take in the days leading up to its release.

--

Later in the day I played for another hour and finished the first
big mission and then started the second. The intro to the second
was hilarious... Raiden in a giant sombrero. You can tell it has
that Metal Gear wackiness. Later in the level, there's this
strange kid from Guyana with a weird accent who thinks you're a
ninja and says "Go Ninja! Go Ninja! Go!" and "Cowabunga", like
TMNT.

Right when I met him though, was an insanely difficult fight with
three Raptor enemies. I played it maybe five times, each time
making almost no progress at all. On maybe the fourth time, I
noticed that I could get a ninja attack on them, so I tried
spamming that while parrying and dodging... and I beat them in
just a few seconds. Crazy. I thought I was going to have to
restart and getting some healing items or something.

This game definitely feels like a Platinum game, but it's really
unique compared to Vanquish or Bayonetta in what you're
doing... but it "feels" the same. It's great.

Before bed I played for about an hour and a half, I made it
through a few rooms. There was a really rough part with some of
the "Silverback" enemies where I had to Stealth-kill them because
they were too powerful to take on all at once, but it was very
hard to sneak up on the third one because he was up
high. Eventually I was able to do it because of a fluke: he fell
off but I didn't, so I hid in a box until the alarm went down
then I did a from-above-Stealth-kill.

The moment in the story of seeing all the detached brains is
CARAZY. Kojima has used child soldiers as a plot point before, but
this is even more bizarre. It's definitely effective for the story
beat it is going for.

book club, so I decided to read it again to help her think of
things to talk about during the meeting.

I read the first two chapters today and thought a lot about the
book from a *REDACTED* perspective. (I'm *REDACTED* and so is Sanderson.)
Here are a few of the ideas, plus some that aren't really related
to *REDACTED*ism.

- Prior to the fall of Elantris, it is almost a *REDACTED*-like notion
of divinity, because anyone can achieve it, although it is given,
rather than earned, so grace is emphasized far more than works.

- In the treatment of people who receive the eternal "life" of
Elantris, what can we learn about how charitable people are?
As far as we know, there's nothing contagious about their
condition and there's no downside for their community, but they
are treated as dead, rejected, and locked up; all for something
they did not choose and have no control over. I can't help but
think of how many homosexuals feel they are treated by popular
American culture.

- The thing that is horrifying about life in Elantris is that it is
eternal and every pain you've ever felt stays with you forever. I
think this is a clear projection of what *REDACTED*ism says Hell is
like: all will inherit eternal life, whether they are "good" or
"bad", but if they reject the Atonement, then they will not allow
the Savior to absolve them of the pain they feel for their
sins. Elantris is a concrete version of this: rather than having
their pain and mistakes washed away so that they "remember them
no more", they remember and feel them forever. Elantris is *REDACTED*
Hell.

- Given that I know what's going to happen in the book, it is
interesting to see Elantris as Hell (or rather, the world without
the Atonement), because essential it makes Raoden Christ: He was
the son of the king of the world that controlled Elantris; he
suffers the same condition as the Elantris and leaves "his
throne on high"; once there, he feels their pain and will teach
them a new way to life with purpose; then, he will redeem them
and restore Elantris to its ancient glory.

- I love the character of Sarene, because she's such a strong and
determined woman in a community (i.e. the king's court) that
doesn't respect women, as shown by their first interaction
together. It is fun to see what she does and to gradually learn
who she is... I think she's a great role model and a surprising
character to be written by a young man in a fantasy novel.

- Clearly the parts that are literally about religion are likely
to be influence in some ways by *REDACTED*ism. I think in this
context though, I see the *REDACTED* understanding of Catholicism at
work. Hrathen and his religion is overtly foreign. He is adamant
that their job is not "love" the people but to "help" the
people, as if they are not the same.

On the other hand, there are aspects about his description of
Derethi that are like the popular understanding of *REDACTED*ism: it
has a rigid military-like structure with a lot of authority and
delegation; a revered prophet; etc. Then again, there's a lot of
Islam there too with the concept of the Caliphate.

Another relevant thing is that the language of religious zeal
Sanderson uses is distinctly *REDACTED*: Dilaf is converted and reads
the two sets of Derethi scriptures in the same night, reminiscent
of Parley P. Pratt and countless other *REDACTED* converts.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Escape from Planet Earth, by Rainmaker Entertainment (2013)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/23/Movie--Escape-from-Planet-Earth--by-Rainmaker-Entertainment--2013--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/23/Movie--Escape-from-Planet-Earth--by-Rainmaker-Entertainment--2013--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/23/Movie--Escape-from-Planet-Earth--by-Rainmaker-Entertainment--2013--0.html">Movie: Escape from Planet Earth, by Rainmaker Entertainment (2013)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I took my kids to see this because it was the earliest movie in the

Earth's greatest inventions being made by aliens and how terrible
Earth is thought of by aliens. My kids cracked up at a few parts
though, so it was worth it to me.

progress on the first mission, fighting a boss and going through
a fun chase sequence. The boss really forced me to learn the
parrying system, although I wasted a lot of health regeneration
items during the fight. I want to try again.

I haven't yet looked into whether I can replay story chapters to
get better scores or things that I missed. For instance, I noticed
what looked like an enemy intel station on top of roof but
couldn't figure out how to get to it. I assumed that I couldn't
but then when I got the next one is was for VR Mission 003, rather
than 002. In retrospect, I bet I could have used the Ninja Run to
get up.

I'm trying to take my time with the game and listen to every
codec conversation and get all the stuff. I think I'll play
through once and then go back and make a list of the stuff I
missed and get them.

I'm really enjoying the gameplay and just starting to master
it. I'm enjoying the world a lot too. I feel like there are little
things fans... like how Raiden's boss say "Keep you waiting, eh?"
and how one of the cyborg is named Sam, like in Vanquish.
