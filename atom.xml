I mainly did VR
Missions. I did everything up to 17. After that I tried each and
said "It's not worth it" and stop. I almost gave up at 13 because
the sliders were so unforgiving, but once I used the Sai and
aerial attacks exclusively it was reasonable. 14 was really hard
too, because it seemed like you to go in the perfect order. 15
and 16 were really dumb. 15 was a waypoint where you run forward
and get knocked back by RPGs and then 16 was "stand-in-place and
shoot a turret". The VR Missions in general feel pretty
un-inspired and tedious to do... and even more tedious to try and
do 1st place on. Maybe it would be a bit easier to swallow if the
reload times weren't so bad.

With that, I'm done with the game. It was very enjoyable and the
combat system was pretty original and fun. I thought the story
was a fun little Metal Gear side-story: it doesn't really move
the whole universe forward, but it feels like it takes place in
the same place, which is cool. I don't think the game's combat
was as deep as Bayonetta or Vanquish, but it was unique and fun
in its own way. I'd definitely play it again in the future, but I
don't feel like I need to 100% it anymore.

a good run and got him to 72.7%, then the next time (30 minutes+
later) my best was 91.9, and then after another 30 minutes or so,
I beat him. Ouch.

I thought the final boss was ridiculously hard and only slightly
unfair, particularly once I realized that you didn't actually have
to slice up the blocks he threw at you and could just avoid them.

Overall, I thought the story was neat and felt very "Metal Gear",
which I like. I thought the gameplay was amazing I intend to
continue playing it and trying to master it. It's really fun and I
think it will be even more fun once I free myself up a bit with
upgrades, etc. I think the biggest gameplay flaw was the camera
not staying on the target you've chosen and it being painful to
select a particular target.

I'm going to start replaying stuff and getting 100% on everything,
which I'll notate as "Game 2". I spent about 40 minutes creating
a TODO list of all the stuff I haven't got in the game and in
which level it was so I can more efficiently go back to the
correct level and do them to get the stuff. Some of them look
really intense to get.

Later in the day, I played for about two hours and played again
on Hard to start getting the stuff I missed. I got everything
(except Trophies) from the first three levels. I'm so much better
at the game now, it's a bit ridiculous.

Compare: "Hrathen would ever bear the scars of what he had done,
but it was better that one man suffer than an entire nation
continue in heresy." (Elantris, p203) vs "Behold the Lord slayeth
the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that
one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish
in unbelief." (1 Nephi 4:13)

Given that I know what will happen in the end, it is exciting to
see the foreshadowing (and foreboding) about the deadly monks of
the East. It's very cool.

Another way to look at what Raoden is doing in Elantris: Since he
giving everyone something to do and their lack of anything to do
was making them miserable, in a sense he is saying that if you (a)
live forever, (b) don't change/grow, and (c) don't have anything to
do, then you will be miserable. This is interesting from a *REDACTED*
perspective, because that describes perfectly what non-*REDACTED*
Heaven is like, whereas in the *REDACTED* concept of Heaven, everyone
has purpose and growth, and thus, according to /Elantris/,
happiness.

I really enjoyed how Raoden "converted" Taan with love and
reminding him of the beauty of the world.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Argo, starring Ben Affleck (2012)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/28/Movie--Argo--starring-Ben-Affleck--2012--0.html">Movie: Argo, starring Ben Affleck (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/28/">28</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a powerful movie.

and the first fight of the next one. The two stages were very
short: Escape from Denver had four fights, I think, and the next
was just a boss fight. When I was doing Escape from Denver, I
suddenly realized it was part of the earlier Denver stage but
backwards so it looked different. I remember Kamiya saying they
did that with Bayonetta too.

The fight with Sam was pretty cool and the parrying technique
wasn't trivial to implement. In general, my parrying is so good
now that I can take on numerous enemies of a type where one would
have brought me down before.

It was cool to see Sunny.

I closed out more of the upgrade shop.

I like the discussion of the holy language of Jaddeth and where
converts should have to learn it. I think there's something similar
in *REDACTED*ism and English because all translations have to made from
English because the source of the Book of *REDACTED* is not available.

I like the discussion of using the Seons in Jaddeth's empire. It
is reminiscent to me of Islamic fundamentalists using technology
for their military purposes, yet claiming that technology designed
for improving people's lives is immoral.

I like that when Raoden meets with Karata the revelation is that
children are the greatest happiness in life and all toil is worth
it if you can take care of them.

My wife had the brilliant idea to see each of the characters as a
different model of leadership. Raoden has optimism and can give
people hope, by putting them to productive ends. Hrathen and
Sarene are both calculating and political, but I think they
represent those skills being put towards bad and good ends, so
they are interesting exemplars.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Expendables 2, starring Everyone Awesome (2012)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-27T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Expendables-2--starring-Everyone-Awesome--2012--0.html">Movie: The Expendables 2, starring Everyone Awesome (2012)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/27/">27</a></span></span><pre class="content">This movie is better in many ways than the first one. I think the
plot is a little bit worse, but a lot of the writing and jokes are
better. The opening was really insane and definitely set the stage
for the ridiculousness with the absurd vehicle choreography. 

The cast was pretty nuts and they really used them in effective
ways and made lots of great references. I like the constant
reference to Dolph Lundgren's actual education and how insane the
Chuck Norris stuff was.

I thought that it was a lot "grosser" than the first one, which
was pretty unfortunate.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Hunter, starring Wilem Dafoe (2011)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Hunter--starring-Wilem-Dafoe--2011--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-27T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Hunter--starring-Wilem-Dafoe--2011--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/27/Movie--The-Hunter--starring-Wilem-Dafoe--2011--0.html">Movie: The Hunter, starring Wilem Dafoe (2011)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/27/">27</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a strange movie.

I was expecting lots
of Hollywood-izing of pregnancy and child birth, which there was,
but it was fairly reasonable in the end. I found the male
perspective in the movie to be very bad though, because it's so
pessimistic and negative towards having kids (despite Chris Rock's
unbelievable monologue.) I never really felt not wanting
responsibility or the fear, so I was disappointed that there was
no one like that in the movie.

I enjoyed the Rosie/Marco plot a lot and wished that he would be
more romantic.

I disliked all the unwed pregnancies.

I thought the Ramsey character was funny (and dumb.)</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Sound of Noise, directed by Ola Simonsson (2010)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/25/Movie--Sound-of-Noise--directed-by-Ola-Simonsson--2010--0.html" /><updated>2013-02-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/02/25/Movie--Sound-of-Noise--directed-by-Ola-Simonsson--2010--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/02/25/Movie--Sound-of-Noise--directed-by-Ola-Simonsson--2010--0.html">Movie: Sound of Noise, directed by Ola Simonsson (2010)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/02/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a fun movie with a bizarre story.

heavily on the core work of the game and made it mostly through
the Denver stage (I think). 

I'm mastering the game a lot more... I've discovered that when you
are cutting off left arms, it is best to aim yourself, but when
you are doing a Ninja Kill, etc, it is best to just use the
Square/Triangle buttons to get an immediate one.

There's lots of stuff I'm clearly missing, because I will get VR
Mission 9 and then 12. I want to play it again anyways, so that's
fine, but it's a bit annoying to think that I've looked everywhere
but have actually missed some stuff.

This game is still great.

In the evening I played for about three hours. I played through
the rest of outside the tower and then the inside, so I fought the
Sundowner guy, who has seemed like the big bad most of the
time. In the fight outside the tower with Monsoon, I finally got
the Parry system down. The key was to realize that it was much
faster than I thought and that you could parry while being hurt
and stunned. Now I feel like I can take on anything.

The fight with Sundowner was intense, but I think I did it the
slow way, because I didn't get off all his armored plates by the
end. The sequence going up the tower was pretty crazy.

I'm a bit surprised that the child-soldier-brain-extraction thing
seems to be /the/ plot, whereas I had originally assumed it would
just be the prelude to something else.

I'm starting to complete some of the upgrade trees, I wonder if
I've missed hidden stuff in the levels?

The opening of the next chapter was pretty nuts... jumping out of
a helicopter onto a jet flying by... very cool.

thoughts.

- The contrast between Dilaf's zealotry and Hrathen's practicality
is very interesting. For example, Dilaf says something like
"Nothing can stand in Jaddeth's way" as an argument against why
they should do some plan for the Kae. Hrathen's response is,
"Then why isn't the whole world converted?" One idea I can see in
this is that often the "sophisticated theology" of the
upper-class of religionists make them have almost totally
different beliefs than the lower-class, to the point that the
upper-class may not even seem like they believe at all. I get
this impression about *REDACTED*ism a lot when people talk about how
to treat new converts, especially those in far away places.

- Hrathen gives a very *REDACTED* explanation of the Svarkiss: "Nothing
is more bitter than a soul who had had its chance and thrown it
away." This is the way that Satan and his followers are discussed
a lot in *REDACTED*ism and how many ex-members are seen.

- A poignant moment in one of Raoden's chapters is the discussion
of how Elantris was not built for normal people to live
in---there are no wells or furnances or lights---and that after
the fall of AonDor it is totally desolate. How is this related to
Modern worry about a too heavy reliance on technology and the
desire to train ourselves to live without in times of disaster?

- I like that Sarene's plan to change the government is so
libertarian and capitalistic. You can almost see the debate on
what to do as a debate about how to intervene in communist
countries and/or get them to change for the better. Freedom
works.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2005/">2005</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry></feed>
