I found the second to last mini-boss to
be really easy once you had an idea of what the strategy was. The
last boss was REALLY hard, because every time I threw the ball
back it missed and then I got hit again. It was very
challenging. The game reminded me a lot of Metroid at the end,
because every time I died, I stood in front of a frog creature
and grinded to get my energy back. It was very tedious and un-fun
to do, of course.

Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable. I think it is a
bit too maze-like to enjoy again. But I like the feel of the
world a lot and enjoyed the experience.

I think my favourite part of it is that
(a) the war is defensive, (b) the idea that the military simpler
exists to protect civilians is very prominent, (c) the soldiers
are "everymen" who aren't the focal point of the war... except a
little bit at the end, and (d) the nobility of the troops. 

It's a very exciting movie too and the alien threat seems "real"
and not super comic-y. It was really great. I really liked the
depiction of aliens and the way the achieved superiority---the
cyborg enhancements and the way they were driving around
artillery/cannon like units.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991) (5)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html" /><updated>2013-03-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html">Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991) (5)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this morning for about two hours and got to 13-5.

Despite quitting, I've enjoyed this game a lot and recommend it.

playing again another time or maybe with the DS remake, where
hopefully the speed is faster.

tight---although the need to press Down to squash enemies is a bit
annoying and sometimes it is painful to make tight jumps because
of the huge sprites. The world feels really big and connected in a
cool way (like Metroid, but unlike, say, Castlevania 2 where the
world is huge but uselessly connected.) I'm enjoying the game.

I'm finding this game has a higher percentage of the kinds of Lolo
puzzles I don't like. I don't like when a puzzle requires a lot of
execution skill, because the controls in these games are so
awkward. I also don't like it when you have to use "holes" and
riding on eggs in water, because you can't really predict where
they will go, so it seems unfair because you can't plan your
solution totally before doing it. Nevertheless, I'm still having
fun.

the story or what to expect. I had assumed it would be a "kids

thought that the plot was interesting and fairly advanced for the
overall feel of the movie. It seems superfluously
computer-animated. There's nothing about the world or the story
that really needs it, and instead because it is animated there are
some ridiculous set pieces that don't feel right for the world. I
found the style to be a bit strange... the heads on all the
characters except for Tintin are too big. It was definitely
striking visually.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html" /><updated>2013-03-19T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html">Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/19/">19</a></span></span><pre class="content">I started this and played up to Level 3 Room 9. The main
difference between this and the previous games is (a) the ability
to play as Lala, which seems to just be a sprite change, and (b)
the separate areas that divide up the puzzles into a kind of
narrative. I find it a bit stupid and tedious to have to do
things other than solve puzzles. It seems strange to me that the
creators would think that people really care about the "world" of
Lolo enough to want to feel like they are "exploring" it, rather
than just doing puzzles. In any case, the puzzles I've done so
far have been fun and have included a few tough ones. I'm looking
forward to completing it.

to be much less satisfying than River City Ransom. The game world
seems huge in comparison and confusingly organized: the majority
of the time I played I just wandered around in a big circle and
ended back in the starting town. I had no idea where I was
supposed to go or how to trigger the boss encounters that control
the progression of these games. The lack of context and the
increased world size really did damage to my appreciation of
it. The game did seem more complex in other ways too though: you
seem to be able to pick up, spin, and throw enemies, which was
new. Also, your "brother" is always present, if A.I. controlled,
which is neat. Nevertheless, I couldn't play it and put it down.

damage on average this time, but that there was less kick-back,
which is nice. I didn't keep going.

felt like an annoying NES game without anything redeeming
now. For the time, it felt solid control and graphics-wise, but
it feels unplayable today.

I beat the first level and played the
second until I died. I found it to be super cute and to really
capture the feeling of "Ghostbusters" with the mechanics of one
character using the stun beam and the other getting the trap in
place. Unfortunately, it was very one-note and it felt like doing
better and getting further was just a matter of memorizing
placement until you could get through unharmed. I feel like it
taught me everything it was going to after a very short amount of
time. It was definitely inspired though.

I
basically just had to go through the final dungeon and beat the
final boss marathon. I didn't find the bosses that challenging.
The formula was to use the last two spells over and over and then
use items to get back some MP. It was a bit of a disappointing
ending. In addition, there's not really a final cut-scene... they
spent most of their "ending" juice on the faux-ending is seems.

Overall, I'd say that this game was beautiful and mechanically
sound, but too boring for my taste. There was a lot of variability
in the game... like the treat system and the huge number of
familiars... that I never really needed to use, which felt like a
let down. I wish there would have been more reason to switch
familiars, for example, rather than just find a few that I had
affinities for and use them the whole time. I also wish that
faster modes of ground transportation would have unlocked, because
moving around in the game started to feel really tedious.

I can imagine recommending the game to a kid, but I don't think I
would to an adult and definitely not a marginal RPG fan. If you
are just going to play one or two RPGs, there are much better
options.
