heard of it, so I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. I didn&#8217;t know it was
a comedy. It was funny, but a lot of it was pretty low brow. I&#8217;m
not even sure I&#8217;d give it a three, despite the funny moments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I play for like two hours this morning to entertain my kids so my
wife could sleep in. It was very interesting to be down on the
Mechonis foot and get to know what happened to Fiora. Her outfits
look very cool&#8230; very similar to KOS-MOS. Dickson is ridiculous
in his ability to be everyone instantly, despite being a level 25
NPC.</p>

<p>Later in the day, we played for another hour and had an epic fight
then went on a dumb fetch quest to get bomb parts. We played again
for just thirty minutes and did a little exploring, before
watching the first war scene and calling it quits for the night.</p>

level then got all the things on the third, except the medal and
the speed trophy. I found it un-intuitive to figure out how to do
the time course. I also find this game to control incredibly
sloppily. The character just swishes around all the time, it is
incredibly obnoxious and hard to deal with.</p>

request. He hasn&#8217;t in a long time, but wanted to today. I played
through it with three continues (one on Tyrannosatan). It was

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like three hours tonight. There&#8217;s been lots of crazy
reveals in the game, some that have been obvious for a long time
and others that were just cool. Getting on to Mechonis was
awesome. It was crazy to see the new map screen. Rad.</p>

<p>Some of the main-line fetch quests in this game are absurd. You
walk through an area and then get to the end are given a fetch
quest where you walk all the way back across the area. It&#8217;s
totally insane.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight. I got to the gate of Prison
Island. The whole High Entia concept is pretty cool&#8230; especially
that there is this giant civilization that&#8217;s totally disconnected
from others beneath it on the monster. The message at the Tomb was
very interesting too&#8230; I wonder what the ancestor&#8217;s plans were
regarding the genetic destiny of their people?</p>

<p>I really enjoyed seeing the waterfall in the forest. It was very
magnificent. My son was very impressed too.</p>

<p>Exploring the Entia capital was very confusing because the arrow
points in the direction of the destination, not the teleporter
that you have to use to get to it. It was very confusing. When I
was exploring these big empty places with very same-y textures and
models, it made me think how much this game is like mid to late
PS2 games in terms of what it tries to do technically. Rather than
having detailed environments, it often has very large environments
with big draw distances as a way to show, for example.</p>

because he likes stories about dogs and exciting adventures by
boys. Today I suggested that he might like to see it. We played
for a bit. I forgot about how in the beginning you see the end of
the game and the various forms of the dog. Cool. We played
through to the bug boss of the pre-historic area, but I died. I
wasn&#8217;t quick enough using items. I forgot that I wouldn&#8217;t have a
checkpoint of some kind and we didn&#8217;t save, but once. So, we
moved on to a different game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son picked this game out because of its box art and it is in
my &#8220;new game queue&#8221;. I&#8217;d been planning on playing it co-op with
my wife, but I couldn&#8217;t dissuade him from wanting to check it
out. I&#8217;ve never played a Rayman game before, so I didn&#8217;t know
what to expect other than that it is a platformer.</p>

<p>I found the world to be really cute and the art to be awesome.</p>

<p>I think the controls are really floaty and delayed (especially
the punches). The running doesn&#8217;t feel quite right either. But
I&#8217;d say it is still on par with DKCR, and not totally terrible.</p>

<p>We played two levels. The first I played twice so I could get all
the stuff and the second I was one shiny thing away from the
second bonus. The collectathon in this game seems more fun that
the collectathons in DKCR and I&#8217;m not sure if I like them more or
less than NSMBW.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to play multiplayer&#8230; maybe I just
needed to have two active controllers. Nor could I understand
what the difference between the characters were. I hope to play
it with my wife eventually, but I probably won&#8217;t play again for a
while unless the kids request it.</p>

are awesome and Elle Fanning is really cute with the kid. The
story was pretty neat&#8230; a kind of myth of the pure native, but in
a different way. The concept of the ship was really cool. The
meta-arc of the kids making the film was really neat too. Overall,
it was very cool and nostalgic. I liked all the ironic references

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I did a lot of exploring and
got into the mines. I&#8217;ve decided that the game play in this really
sucks:</p>

<p>Basically the only task that you do in combat as a player is
click on the 8 buttons for the different skills. There&#8217;s no real
reason to do any skill at any particular time, because status
effects will either stack or not and by the time one runs out,
you can just cast it again. So basically, everyone combat starts
by clicking everything and then waiting until you can click them
all again in sequence. Occasionally you have to remember to use
Enchant when you&#8217;re fighting Mechon and to move around a little
after killing each enemy so you&#8217;re in range, but you really don&#8217;t
need to give any of it much more thought than that. I can tell
that no more strategy is required because I can basically walk
through the game up to this point, doing this strategy, and
winning basically every fight. I&#8217;ve only lost if I got into a
fight that was way over level or I was too close to two groups of
enemies and they joined together. It&#8217;s very uninteresting.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, there also isn&#8217;t that much to do because each
character basically only has 10 or so abilities and they are all
so meh and I can&#8217;t imagine really caring one way or another about
why you&#8217;d pick one versus the other.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t really understand why a lot of people gave this game such
high reviews. It pales in comparison to other RPGs like FF13 or
Lost Odyssey, where there are actually interesting choices to
make in combat. I&#8217;ve read so much that the game is so good
because it takes (presumably &#8220;good&#8221;) Western ideas and mixes them
with Japanese design. Man, this Western design, if it means the
combat system, is total junk. I&#8217;ve read that it&#8217;s very similar to
WoW&#8230; now I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t like WoW.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to think of why I feel like it&#8217;s different than FF12,
which was very MMO-ish. I think the reason why it is different is
the Gambits. Basically in FF12, Gambits automated what the player
is &#8220;doing&#8221; in Xenoblade. Since that was necessarily going on, the
game was free to through bigger challenges on top of those and
have lots of split second usage of the special moves, which
constituted a really large set. In Xenoblade, you never feel like
you died because of lack of strategy, you feel like you died
because of stupid AI or not enough grinding. Whereas in FF12, I
could die, gain some knowledge from the experience, restart and
immediately win the battle, because I knew something I didn&#8217;t
know before. With Xenoblade (so far), the only reason you didn&#8217;t
grind enough or you fell asleep with an active fight.</p>

<p>Xenoblade has caused me to think about RPG combat systems at the
meta-level a bit. In Xeno, you have 8 skills, each with separate
cool-downs, so basically every 30 seconds you are using skill A
and since you can spawn so many at once, basically, there are
little bursts of doing a lot of skills followed by waiting around
for the skills to be reusable. In contrast, in a traditional
JRPG, there are about 30 or 40 skills (i.e. magic spells,
summons, attack techniques, etc) plus items. Each skill has a
cost of some kind so you can&#8217;t always choose it (summons are once
per battle, items are limited, spells use MP, etc.) But you can
only do one action every 5 seconds when your turn comes up. Since
every character is on their own timer and the enemies are acting
to. There is always one thing happening and you can always pay
attention to it (if it is a player, you&#8217;re picking it, and if it
is an enemy, you&#8217;re thinking about how to respond.) In contrast,
with Xeno, there&#8217;s a lot going at once so you can&#8217;t pay attention
and the decisions that you make are basically non-existent. Once
you choose the initial skill order, there&#8217;s no reason to do
anything except use the skills again once they cool down. All
strategy takes place in the first few seconds and then you&#8217;re
just doing a rote execution. In addition, the number of skills in
the traditional JRPG makes it so the solution space is much large
so it can more difficult to plan. (For example, you have the
elemental affinities, healing spells, buffs, etc.)</p>

<p>Xenoblade is just a really boring game combat-wise and the
meta-game is very tedious and/or confusing. I&#8217;m really let down
by this because the game was so hyped.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m incredibly compelled by the world and the story. It&#8217;s
so strange and interesting. I want to play the game just to
experience that, provided it won&#8217;t cost 50 hours. I wonder if I
can easily speed my way through the game without any grinding or
BS and if I&#8217;ll be able to bear it long enough.</p>

<p>This conclusion makes most nervous about Last Story which I have
been equally (actually /more/ hyped about.) We&#8217;ll see.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p%3D2597">This action button review</a> of the game captures my feelings about a
lot of the system-overload this game throws at you so early and
the sheer weight of the quests. The comment about the difference
between abilities and skills is very apt&#8212;I have no clue what&#8217;s
going on in that system. Something related is that for a lot of
the game so far I&#8217;ve been killing every enemy in my path, but then
I noticed that a lot of the enemies are just giving me 1 or 2
EXP&#8230; what&#8217;s the point of that? But there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a
good way to tell what is going to be a good amount of EXP before
hand. It&#8217;s a bit confusing.</p>

<p>Today, I played for a little over three hours. I advanced the
story quite a bit. I was really annoyed by the lack of a feeling
of progress behind all the numbers. I repeatedly tried to get
past a little path that was blocked by enemies and I seemed to be
dying with no explanation.</p>

<p>I went back to the gem guy to create a whole bunch of gems, but I
don&#8217;t really know if they are really all that good or if I
shouldn&#8217;t have spent them all, because I have a lot of gems now
and not enough places to put them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really conflicted about the battle system. In some ways, it&#8217;s
no different than a traditional FF or DQ game, because you
generally attack and then use special attacks when you have
enough energy to. But on the other hand, it feels like a lot of
meaningful decision is taken from you. For example, there&#8217;s an
air of strategy in your positioning, but with huge crowds of
enemies it is so hard to see where you are, where their face is,
etc that being in the front/back/side is almost irrelevant
because you can&#8217;t reliably tell. The whole
Monado-tells-the-future system being integrated into the combat
is really remarkable and unique. I&#8217;m not yet to the point though
where the vision really does me any good because I don&#8217;t
understand how it is supposed to be canceled.</p>

<p>Basically, at this point, I find the whole game to be really
confusing in the mechanic department. There&#8217;s a lot that I can do
and I&#8217;m treating it like a traditional JRPG, but I feel like I&#8217;m
missing something when I do, but I&#8217;m not really being punished
for ignoring it, but I&#8217;m constantly being flirted with by all
these other weird numbers and concepts. It&#8217;s just a really
strange game.</p>
