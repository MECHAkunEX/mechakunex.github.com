happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a whole bunch of puzzles today. I did all the ones in the
main game, plus the train, fish tank, and puppet mini-games. I am
still going to watch the &#8220;Episodes&#8221; and then do the bonus
puzzle challenges. (So I have like 15 puzzles left.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a much better movie than the last one. I think my
favourite part of it was how it is basically the story of Catholic
theology: God enters the Void and creates Angels to assist Him in
creating perfection, but later finds (or creates) Humans, who are
imperfect, but have agency and can therefore grow and experience
love, but this upsets His chief Angel who fights against Him out of
jealousy. This particular story takes an approach very similar to
His Dark Materials, where God loses and someone has to come and
save him. The film is very cool throughout.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan&#8217;s Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight&#8230; including all four bottles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the game, although of course I still have extra puzzles
to do. It was a very cute ending. I&#8217;d say it wasn&#8217;t the best
story, but it was very cute and probably the second best. I also
like how it explains how Luke and Layton meet. You do wonder where
Emmy and Decole went though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O&#8217;Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew&#8230; more craziness comes along.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he&#8217;ll play himself some day and I&#8217;ll watch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary&#8217;s adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it&#8217;s now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn&#8217;t
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fascinating episode. I find Mrs. Crawley to be really
annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can
be together. I felt very badly for Daisy as well. I&#8217;m proud of
Edith too, she&#8217;s been very nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I watched this in preparation for the sequel. It was
very interesting, especially by putting ourselves in the mindset of
someone from the 1980s. It&#8217;s fascinating how just 10 or so years
after the movie came out, consumer computers would have been able
to render the graphics in real-time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the last week I&#8217;ve been playing more than one puzzle a day
because I want to empty my queue. Tonight I played for a little
more two hours while watching YouTube videos. I did one of the
marble jump puzzles on my first try, it was awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The drama is on very quickly. I don&#8217;t like the idea of them using
the house for more to do with the war. I like the way its about
almost nothing but the tragedy of war and the stupidity of people
who see it as valorous and good. I&#8217;m appalled by Edith cheating
with a farmer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote in my calendar to check on the DLC about six months after
I beat the game, when presumably it would all have been
released. It has. I looked for information about it and almost
none of it seems interesting, except Lightning&#8217;s episode. But, I
found that it only takes about 25 minutes (including cut-scenes)
and that&#8217;s not worth 5 bucks, so I just watched it. The new ending
is neat. I&#8217;m excited for 13-3. I love this battle system so much
and I find the world to be really cool too. I hope it can be
efficient for them to produce, make them lots of money, and make
FF15 amazing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about forty minutes tonight. I tried using the
Gamecube controller because I thought it would be easier to make
small movements when dodging and I could aim the cross-hair at the
center once and for all (given that the boss doesn&#8217;t move much)
and then dodge. I was able to do about as well as usual, but not
better. I don&#8217;t think it was worth it, so I went back to the
normal method. This is a very hard battle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m kind of amazed at how things played out in this episode. I
thought they did a great job bringing a lot of characters to
closure. I was appalled by the horribleness of O&#8217;Brien. I was
very disappointed in Mary&#8217;s backbiting against Edith. I felt very
sad for her. I did feel sad for Mary as well, but since it was
her own fault, it&#8217;s more an emotional tragedy than a real
injustice. I&#8217;m still amazed that Mary really did do something
with the Turk. I was sure there would be some great revelation in
this episode that would redeem her. Unfortunate. I&#8217;m very curious
how the next season will go, because they&#8217;ve been able to write a
lot of characters out and drastically change the circumstances
for the next set of episodes.</p>

between Mary and Matthew. Bates makes a small comment about
having been there for two years&#8230; at that point I had no clue
what the timescale of the episodes were. I would have guessed
mere months had gone by. They should do a better job showing the
passing of time.</p>
