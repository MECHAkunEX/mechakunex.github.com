    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for about an hour today. I used an emulator and
couldn&#8217;t resist save states. In the beginning, I worked my way
through on my own, using saves at each screen. I had no sense of
what the items would do, so I didn&#8217;t really buy any. After a
while, I looked at a walkthrough (which basically just recommended
which items to buy) and learned that I missed a few essential
hidden items. I restarted and made it to stage 4 following the
guide. I went away to eat, paused, and when I came back, the game
had reset itself.</p>

<p>This game looks and sounds really good, especially for its
age. It&#8217;s cute and has some interesting mechanics. I think of it
as a lot like Zelda 2, but with a less interesting combat system,
sloppier mechanics, and a more advanced inventory system. I found
the jumps to feel really wrong and the combat delays to be pretty
painful. The inventory system, once you realize what things are,
is neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that this is a pretty amazing game for its age,
but that a lot about it works against it. The biggest problem is
the lack of continues. The game is too deep on a customization
level to make sense as an arcade game. I presume that later
version of the game change this, because they were designed for
consoles. Secondly, the sprites are a bit too big and they make
it hard to see what&#8217;s going on. Third, the jumps and fighting
don&#8217;t feel quite right.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t play this, but I&#8217;m excited to investigate other games in
this series.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like Alien Crush, this game is a very exciting and interesting
pinball table. I feel like this game is a lot crazier because
after the initial ideas in Alien Crush, they were able to go all
out. There&#8217;s lots moving around on the course, there&#8217;s three
layers, and many complicated dependencies between
pieces. In that sense, it&#8217;s much better. Plus, they added a
pass-the-controller 2-player option, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ball physics feel much worse and the ball seems
totally outside of your control. I think part of it is that the
board is broken into three screens and each one is squatter (and
thus more detailed) than any screen was in Alien Crush. At the end
of the day, the game feels worse, despite looking much cooler.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I could imagine playing this game a lot&#8230; if not
for the interface friction.</p>

<p>When I played, my dad and I did the pass-the-controller for a
bit. My best score was 3.7 mil. I got this by getting the castle
on the bottom and then just being super cautious whenever I was
on the bottom screen. It worked like a charm!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the &#8220;living&#8221; board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it&#8217;s not too hard to get used
to.</p>

<p>I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there&#8217;s not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don&#8217;t really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &amp;
weren&#8217;t learning experiences.</p>

<p>I enjoy the game a lot, although I&#8217;m not sure how much I
like <em>this</em> game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I&#8217;ve played
this many many times with other people&#8230; like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I&#8217;ve never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you&#8217;re traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it&#8217;s really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I&#8217;ll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strong enough to last on its own&#8230; but then
again, it&#8217;s has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been about a month since I&#8217;ve played this game and I&#8217;m not
really interested in trying it again. It&#8217;s a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren&#8217;t compelling enough to last much longer than I&#8217;ve
played. It&#8217;s too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren&#8217;t gravity puzzles, as far as
I&#8217;ve seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn&#8217;t find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn&#8217;t effectively do the &#8220;hit yourself&#8221; trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn&#8217;t do that because I
didn&#8217;t have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I&#8217;m
curious about the story, but I&#8217;ll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today and gave it another chance. This time, it was a
total breeze. I did die in the Amazon after spending $300k, which
was really painful, but I realized that if you just hold bounce
next to the statue, guys come and die under you without a chance
of getting hurt. This was totally boring and stupid (it took
a few minutes), but it wasn&#8217;t horrific. After that, there was no
more grinding. The whole game was really short&#8230; just about an
hour from start to finish. The best part was the unique challenge
of not being able to directly jump on enemies and the way you
sometimes needed to whack things with your cane. (For example,
the mummy ducks in the mansion where fun to fight when you had to
whack their ball &amp; chain.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was fun&#8230; good music, cute monsters&#8230; and
it&#8217;s classic in a certain sense, but I don&#8217;t feel it is worth
replaying, because it is sooo easy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don&#8217;t
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff.</p>

<p>Normal games can&#8217;t be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don&#8217;t give instant, infinite
respawns.</p>

<p>This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next.</p>

<p>(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them&#8230; it is horrifically bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played and beat this tonight. Last time I played, I could barely
get past the first level because it is so brutal and you need to
grind, but it&#8217;s practically impossible. This time, I tried to use
a code that gave more hearts per heart icon you got, but it didn&#8217;t
really help. I used a password that gave me more levels and that
made a big difference. The hardest part of the game was the third
fortress, because it was so complex of a labyrinth. It&#8217;s a fun
game&#8230; a little too floaty jumps and the inability to scroll
backward is bit rough, but for an old game it has pretty decent
mechanics. Although it is a classic in my memory, it&#8217;s systems
don&#8217;t live up to being a real classic.</p>

seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren&#8217;t even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn&#8217;t utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.</p>
