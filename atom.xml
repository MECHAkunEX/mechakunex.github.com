    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a very busy but ultimately unproductive day with a lot of
wasted effort, so I played games rather later to feel some
accomplishment. I played for about 2 hours. I got through all of
chapter 11 and did the skirmish that opened up three times (Easy,
Normal, Normal)&#8230; all As (2 rounds!)&#8230; to get enough money to
buy everything. The beach battle was pretty scary, but I was able
to do it in 2 rounds with only 2 restarts. It was pretty cool to
have a few &#8220;stealth&#8221; levels.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought that I hadn&#8217;t seen this movie, but actually I have. Given
when it came out, I think I saw it in the theatres during grad
school. I would often go to the movie theater by myself on boring
nights/afternoons.</p>

<p>I think the production quality on the movie is significantly higher
and the fights are a lot more interesting. They did a good job
introducing new characters that were different. I like the
development of the mythology. Kate Beckinsale continues to look
amazing and she seems to be wearing a slightly different cat-suit.
The monsters look a little less like Buffy villains, but still a
little bit cheesy.</p>

<p>The plot feels a lot simpler, more like a roller-coaster ride where
the characters are chased from one place to the next without much
time for mystery or real plot development. It&#8217;s a bit more of a
standard action movie in that regard, and I think it suffers
compared to the last for it. The cast of meaning characters is a
lot smaller with most (such as Corvinus and Tanis) really only have
one scene. The high point of the movie is probably the set of
flashbacks scenes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the 10th chapter tonight&#8230; the tank battle through the
city was pretty awesome, although I didn&#8217;t understand how the
lifts would work, so I tried to bunch all the characters together
before having them ride it&#8230; but of course they went one at a
time. Very annoying. I wanted to keep playing tonight, but decided
not to. I wanted to because I&#8217;m curious about what Zaka will be
like&#8230; do I really get another vehicle? I&#8217;m running really low on
money too, so I think I need to play skirmishes a few times to get
capital to buy the rest of the available upgrades.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat the game tonight after playing for about 5 hours. The final
battle was super tough. I liked all the build-up side battles
too. The best part of the final battle were the cool 2D animations
and &#8220;camera&#8221; changes. It was pretty unique, although something
similar happened a few times in earlier parts of the game.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this game to be pretty rad. The game play is
straight-forward, but quick enough to not be too tedious compared
to the first three. The lack of a job system is fine, because the
individual characters you are given are interesting enough. The
story is very quaint and cute; the way they broke up the story is
very cool, especially how people act around the Hero.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell how much of what I like (such as the Heal All option)
were added in the remake, but I don&#8217;t feel like I need to play the
NES version to find out.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d play it again, because I&#8217;m willing to bet that
another Dragon Quest game (maybe a SNES one?) will be a more
refined experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I forget why, but the other day I was reminded of this series. I
decided to start watching it, similar to how I went through the
Resident Evil movies. Like that series, I saw the first one when it
came out, but never saw the others. I remember thinking the movie
was cool and that Kate Beckinsale was amazing attractive.</p>

<p>On a second viewing, significantly older, I still think some parts
of the movie are cool. The mythology is interesting and fairly
developed. The actor of Viktor is pretty awesome; while the actor
that played Kraven was unbelievably bad. The character of Erica is
really interesting and subtle. And, yes, Kate Beckinsale is
woah&#8212;except, I don&#8217;t understand the appeal of the &#8220;cat suits&#8221;,
they make all her natural curves indistinguishable, like a running
bra or something. I don&#8217;t get it, but I guess that had to because
this movie was made to be so Matrix-y. The action sequences are
very derivative of the Matrix and pretty boring overall
actually. Lots of akimbo and chunks of buildings flying off. The
best fight is probably the very first one. Even the final fight
between Viktor and Michael is pretty meh, because Michael is so
&#8220;whatever&#8221; that it doesn&#8217;t get too exciting.</p>

<p>Definitely not a classic, but I&#8217;m interested in watching the rest
of them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another three hours. Today I did a few battles and I realized what
the &#8220;reports&#8221; I&#8217;d seen showing up were&#8230; how you have to go back
in Book Mode to the report. I watched all of them. The
fan-service&#8230; I mean, the beach vacation&#8230; one was funny. The
battles are becoming quite diverse. The one where you take the
tank through the city was pretty cool, as was the one were you had
to cut off the armored car.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours throughout the day today while the
kids were playing and/or sick. I explored the waterfall and used
my water soaking stone and got a rad sword. I also did a little
bit of grinding until I could be Estark&#8230; which I barely did;
Ragnar was the only one left and he would&#8217;ve only last one
hit&#8230; and he was killed in the first fight as I tried to
escape. But, alas, I did.</p>

<p>After I got the balloon, I decided to be done for the night. As I
was looking at the world map, I thought how geeky and funny it
would be to have an &#8220;accurate&#8221; polar projection map with scaling
deformation in certain regions (including on the characters &amp;
their speed.) That would be funny.</p>

<p>Shopping list:
- 35k per Liquid Metal Armor in Endor (secret shop, need 3)
- Female armor in Elf town (need 2?)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie was really different than I thought it would be. I
expected that the end of the movie would be closer to ape dominance
and I expected that the character of Caesar would be more of a hero
for humans&#8212;kind of the only smart ape that loved humans, whereas
the other ones (like Koba) would just hate them. The movie was
pretty cool and Caesar was a great epic leader. There were lots of
really cool &#8220;A-hah!&#8221; moments of his progression that were super
satisfying. I&#8217;d like to see sequels to this made.</p>

beat Glass Joe by decision after losing by decision and having me
show her how it was done. She lost on the next fight but I took
the continue and took it all the way to Soda Popinski. It was
pretty rad to go through the whole game up to that point and show
off to her a bit. My code this time around was different though:</p>

really likes collecting everything and exploring the area, trying
to do harder things. In contrast, I find that annoying and prefer
to just go through the obstacle course as fast as possible. But,
the secret of marital bliss is she tells me what to do, and I do
it, so I repented. =)</p>

getting pretty rough and un-cheese-able, which is really fun
because it forces me to try different things. I got a really bad
score in the second woodland battle, which was kinda sad, so I did
another skirmish so I could get the XP I missed. I really enjoyed
using the tank a lot in the woodland battle though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and did a lot of exploring and
learning about the many quests I need to finish to get all the
Zenithian equipment. There&#8217;s a lot to keep track of and
remember. I feel like I need to write it down. I think in a modern
game there would be in-game markers of some kind that might make
it to easy or feel to &#8220;fetch questy&#8221;, but when you actually have
to remember what&#8217;s going on, it feels more real and fun. It&#8217;s an
interesting thing.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my list:
- The sword is near a waterfall
- I have the water soaking stone
- I need to go to a mine near the French stuff</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I spent a very
long time on the Desert Duel against the giant tank. There was a
lot of saving and reloading as I tried different techniques and
slowly got closer to victory. It was a really tough, complicated
fight. The stealth mission was pretty tough too; I kept making
stupid mistakes and trying to kill the soldier named &#8220;Ty the
Immortal&#8221;&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t seem to land a killing hit on him&#8230; maybe
his name was a clue from the developers? I&#8217;m sad I didn&#8217;t get an A
on that fight.</p>

<p>I think it is cool how the came is slowly becoming more
&#8220;fantastical&#8221; in its setting with the discovery at the ruins,
etc. It&#8217;s neat because the earlier parts of the game are so
realistic-ish.</p>

<p>The battles tonight were especially fun because I couldn&#8217;t cheese
them, so I had to really use all the options that were
available. Nevertheless, I had some pretty brutal strategies. For
example, in the desert fight, I was able to kill all the enemy
foot soldiers on the first round with my two snipers and
Rosie. Then I was able to take out all the gun turrets on the tank
in two rounds. Then it was just a matter of waiting around while
the radiators showed up. When Selvaria surprise attacked, Rosie
was right next to where her units appeared, so she was able to
kill every single one on the first round. Then Selvaria ignored
her and just ran past. It was pretty rad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through a boss fight with a tiny bit of grinding to get
strong enough for it. I got totally tooled the first time, but I
got about one level per character, maybe two, and then totally
destroyed the boss (Baal-something?) on the second try. It was
weird. I thought the hidden sign was pretty cool and when I went
back to the town I immediately remembered about the door I
couldn&#8217;t go to before. I like it when things like that work out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)&#8212;getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two&#8212;then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.</p>

<p>I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can&#8217;t do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.</p>

<p>I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can&#8217;t reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can&#8217;t decide that
you&#8217;ve made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don&#8217;t put enough Lancers, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don&#8217;t see why
this is kept from me.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&amp;D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&amp;D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So far I&#8217;m really like the story and the gameplay. It&#8217;s a really
fun game!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about five hours today during my looong travel
home. I got to the hero&#8217;s story and I&#8217;m finding it a little
confusing compared to what came before because so much of the
world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the &#8220;best&#8221; choice and keep all the characters balanced.</p>
