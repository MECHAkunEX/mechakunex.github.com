    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We got through Ganon&#8217;s tower today with 2 blue potions and 2
fairies. We lost the last fairy in the fight versus Agahnim, which
we entered with only three hearts. After that, I fought Ganon,
but failed to use a potion after using a fairy, then filled up
again and won. Woot!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played a few levels tonight and finished Area 6. I found a lot
of the levels to be really difficult to have two people, because
they use forced scrolling and the timed barrel jumps, which
require a lot more synchronization than is reasonable between two
people. Overall, the game seems to have multiplayer as an after
thought, especially with the varied capabilities of the two
players. The boss of Area 6 was very exciting to beat with my
wife, we were yelling and jumping out of our seats as we
recognized tells of the boss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie was fun, but definitely not as good as the first one. I
think the plot was much weaker and the cast was kind of thrown
together for no good reason&#8212;whereas the first one had a very
nice progression of how people joined the group.</p>

<p>Rosamund Pike was very beautiful, but it was very weird that the
actress from the previous movie was replaced and because she acted
so differently than the character before I didn&#8217;t realize it was
supposed to be the same person.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t feel like the sequel was really necessary, which
is unfortunate, because I thought the first one was so good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played again for two hours with my son paying good attention for
the first half. I beat dungeons six and seven, then started
Ganon&#8217;s Tower, but didn&#8217;t do too much of it. I also got the Golden
Sword and Silver Arrows and the 1/2 magic thing. This is such a
great game.</p>

many wonderful things happened. I feel like Daisy and Mary really
deserve their happiness. I like the way things happened with each
of them. The grandma was in ripe form this episode too. Classic.</p>

happened. However, it was mostly tragic. I feel like it is just
getting us ready for the good things that will happen in the NEXT
episode. Lord Grantham&#8217;s kiss was ridiculously out of place in my
opinion.</p>

main game, plus the train, fish tank, and puppet mini-games. I am
still going to watch the &#8220;Episodes&#8221; and then do the bonus
puzzle challenges. (So I have like 15 puzzles left.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a much better movie than the last one. I think my
favourite part of it was how it is basically the story of Catholic
theology: God enters the Void and creates Angels to assist Him in
creating perfection, but later finds (or creates) Humans, who are
imperfect, but have agency and can therefore grow and experience
love, but this upsets His chief Angel who fights against Him out of
jealousy. This particular story takes an approach very similar to
His Dark Materials, where God loses and someone has to come and
save him. The film is very cool throughout.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for an hour and forty-five minutes. We got the
third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan&#8217;s Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight&#8230; including all four bottles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished the game, although of course I still have extra puzzles
to do. It was a very cute ending. I&#8217;d say it wasn&#8217;t the best
story, but it was very cute and probably the second best. I also
like how it explains how Luke and Layton meet. You do wonder where
Emmy and Decole went though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a crazy episode. I thought the Canadian was very clever,
but was ultimately just a fake. I can see where O&#8217;Brien is going
to go with thinking Bates killed his wife, but I think it was
really Richard or just some other anonymous problem. Just when
you thought things were starting to be a bit rosier for Mary and
Matthew&#8230; more craziness comes along.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours today. We got the second crystal and
got to the final part of the third dungeon in the Dark World. In
addition we did a bit of exploration and found some cool things in
the world. I love this game. My son is really enjoying it too,
although at about an hour and fifteen minutes he starts getting
tired of it. I hope he&#8217;ll play himself some day and I&#8217;ll watch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I feel sorry for Ethel. This was a really important episode
for the overall plot. Mary&#8217;s adventure has hung over the story
for so long, it&#8217;s now come to a bit of a head. The timing doesn&#8217;t
seem like it could be better for Mary to marry Matthew, but if
she does then Carlisle has the means and motivation to ruin
her. I felt quite bad for Daisy as well. Intense.</p>

annoying. I was also surprised that the situation with Lavinia
was not so bad and that she and Mary are kind to one another. I
keep expecting something to happen so that Mary and Matthew can

very interesting, especially by putting ourselves in the mindset of
someone from the 1980s. It&#8217;s fascinating how just 10 or so years
after the movie came out, consumer computers would have been able
to render the graphics in real-time.</p>
