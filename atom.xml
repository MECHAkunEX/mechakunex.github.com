    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/Movie&#8211;The-Lorax&#8211;by-Dr&#8211;Seuss&#8211;2012&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took my son to this today. It was his first time going to a movie
theatre. We had a lot of fun. We had to sit in the very front row,
because he couldn&#8217;t see over any of the other seats. I think I will
bring a booster in the future. We got popcorn and played arcade
games after too.</p>

<p>The movie was very well made with really neat visuals. The story
is, of course, anti-freedom and greatly misunderstands
capitalism. The Once-ler is not bad because he cuts down trees,
he&#8217;s a bad businessman because he doesn&#8217;t have a lasting business
strategy. He should have replanted as he cut them down. The Lorax
would like people to live in poverty and pain. O&#8217;Hare is the
classic business-as-murderous kind, which is absurd. My son and I
had a talk about the bad economics in the movie afterwards.</p>

<p>I read the Wikipedia page on the critical response. There&#8217;s this
text:</p>

<p>David Edelstein: &#8220;the touch of their tufts was much softer than
silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk&#8221; &#8211; and
[in the movie] Ted says, &#8220;Wow, what does that even mean?&#8221; and
Audrey says, &#8220;I know, right?&#8221; So one of the only lines that is from
the book, that does have Dr. Seuss&#8217; sublime whimsy, is basically
made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an idiot! Obviously Ted says that because they don&#8217;t know what
silk or what butterflies are. They aren&#8217;t making fun of the line!
It is a brilliant way of making fun of the emptiness of their lives
in Thneedville!</p>

amazing. The re-writing of the Snow White story was really
cool. Collins looked stunning. I loved the dance scene at the end

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing this regularly for so long and I&#8217;ve never gotten
past Soda Popinski. I think I will retire it for a
while. Definitely an awesome game, but it has shattered me for a
while. A part of me suspects that I need to get a TV setup with
lower lag to be successful. But that&#8217;s probably just being a sore
loser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided to retire this game for a while. I haven&#8217;t really
been playing that much even though I have it scheduled and kind of
want to. I think I need to start again from the beginning with no
assists. I only have the Endurance Races, the Formula GT races,
and the Special Events to get Golds on, but I don&#8217;t want to spend
the time on the Endurance ones and the Formula/Special events are
so technical, I think my skills just aren&#8217;t up to the task. I
think I need to re-learn to play. I&#8217;m going to put it on my
schedule to play it again in January and give it another try. I
can&#8217;t believe how much and how long I&#8217;ve played this game. It&#8217;s
sooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat the game today. (Although I used a 4x EXP and GOLD cheat so
I didn&#8217;t have to grind. Luckily it did not make the game easy
really, it just saved time.) It was very cool. I like how
heart-warming and family-oriented the game is. It is also neat how
you go a grand tour of the world so you can revisit everyone. This
has been my favourite DQ so far. I really liked 4 a lot, but I
think this one was incredible. I almost want to say they&#8217;re just
getting better, but I know that 9 is not as good as this.</p>

<p>Near the end of the game I developed an awesome strategy: have my
wife use the Sage Stone every round; use the main character and my
son to attack; and then use my daughter to buff/debuff and use
staves for other effects, including healing. It worked awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telebunny.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/DragonQuestVHeavenlyHeartbreak">A great review</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode was appalling! I can&#8217;t believe that Mary would
really act that way, especially when her virtue had just been
established beforehand. This seems like a case of modern writers
putting modern loose morals into the past inappropriately. I do
find it very believable that Matthew would be more attracted to
Mary when he was ignored. I wonder if we are to believe that
something sinister is behind the Turk&#8217;s death?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little more than three hours tonight as I watched
some YouTube videos. I made a lot of progress and had a lot of
fun. I got my wife back. It is really fun to have the whole family
together in the party now&#8230; even though my wife is much weaker
than the other party members. I&#8217;d like to keep her in just for
fun. There were some more adorable puns in the last section. I get
the feeling I&#8217;m basically done with the game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting movie. The whole plot is really loose and a
bit lifeless compared to the first. It improves a lot towards the
end. The beginning just feels like lots of stupid moments for
Downey to do his thing. It&#8217;s funny of in this universe Holmes is
this weird kung-fu master guy. There&#8217;s lots of really cool effects
and moments that I enjoyed in the movie though.</p>

40 minutes. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to
do. I thought I couldn&#8217;t use at the flying carpet because at first
it said I couldn&#8217;t use it (because I was on a forest square). That
was annoying. I got the Magma Staff and now I&#8217;ll try to get to the
fallen Zenithian Castle. I like how this game has so many
references to the last one.</p>

will be like because it had a very well scoped out plot. It was
interesting how they were able to communicate Matthew&#8217;s distaste
for aristocracy, but his partial acceptance of it at the end.</p>

break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot&#8230; it made it more
dramatic. It&#8217;s also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I&#8217;m glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane&#8217;s voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments&#8230; it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can&#8217;t have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan&#8217;s insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>

the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, &#8220;Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?&#8221; He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn&#8217;t move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

<p>We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.</p>

love over the course of 10 days and then didn&#8217;t see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren&#8217;t totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren&#8217;t really
super heroes&#8230; more &#8220;super spys&#8221; and that didn&#8217;t seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character&#8230; the actor played him too &#8220;cool&#8221; and above-it-all.</p>

<p>There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, there&#8217;s only one God, and I don&#8217;t
think He dresses like that.&#8221; Not only was it delivered really well,
but it&#8217;s such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.</p>
