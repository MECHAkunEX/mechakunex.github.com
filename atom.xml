We needed subtitles when we watched it
though, so we missed a lot of the subtlety in the Japanese
dialogue. It was fun to watch on our way home from being in
Japan. I really liked the moments of dialogue though, especially
when Mariko is talking about how her grandfather would tell her
stories about Wolverine. There were a lot funny bits, like when he
throws the finance minister out the window. And there are some
really gross moments that make me cringe even now, i.e. the scene
were he cuts his chest open. Again, Wolverine kills everyone. I
think the strongest thing about this movie is that it really is a
"Wolverine" movie, as there are basically no other mutants of
importance.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: X-Men: First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn (2011)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men--First-Class--directed-by-Matthew-Vaughn--2011--0.html"/><updated>2016-03-07T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men--First-Class--directed-by-Matthew-Vaughn--2011--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men--First-Class--directed-by-Matthew-Vaughn--2011--0.html">Movie: X-Men: First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn (2011)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/03/07/">07</a></span></span><pre class="content">It's cool that this movie opens with the same footage from the

of the series. It's kind of absurd how much the movie is about
"boobs and babes" though. The captions on place locations are
really on the nose, "Secret CIA Research Base" and "Russian
Military Leader's Mansion". Finally, I found the Banshee and Fly to
be really lame characters and Havoc's initial way he uses his
powers to be pretty meh.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: X-Men Origins: Wolverine, starring Hugh Jackman (2009)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men-Origins--Wolverine--starring-Hugh-Jackman--2009--0.html"/><updated>2016-03-07T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men-Origins--Wolverine--starring-Hugh-Jackman--2009--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/03/07/Movie--X-Men-Origins--Wolverine--starring-Hugh-Jackman--2009--0.html">Movie: X-Men Origins: Wolverine, starring Hugh Jackman (2009)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/03/07/">07</a></span></span><pre class="content">The opening of this movie is so awesome.

morals of the movie are a little bad though, because there's no
resolution to some of the bad behavior of the characters. For
instance, the wife does not really suffer because of her adultery;
the husband does not really resolve the issue with the teacher;
Jacob does not really have any consequence for his previous
behavior; and Jess' decision at the end to give the kid the photos
doesn't make any sense, especially because she has them with her
even though she couldn't have predicted his speech at the
graduation. Nevertheless, if you don't think too hard, hte movie is
very clever and fun.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: The Importance of Being Earnest, starring Colin Firth (2002)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/02/Movie--The-Importance-of-Being-Earnest--starring-Colin-Firth--2002--0.html"/><updated>2016-03-02T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/03/02/Movie--The-Importance-of-Being-Earnest--starring-Colin-Firth--2002--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/03/02/Movie--The-Importance-of-Being-Earnest--starring-Colin-Firth--2002--0.html">Movie: The Importance of Being Earnest, starring Colin Firth (2002)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/03/02/">02</a></span></span><pre class="content">This is such a silly, funny movie.

different. After that moment, I thought it would be more like a
cross between Twilight and Harry Potter, but it barely used those
tropes as well. I felt like it was much more like an arc of a
season of Buffy... lots of cute quips and dialog in a really weird
world that is super inspired by pop culture. I really liked it and
feel it might be a personal classic for me. I think I may try to

there's a long sequence here that reminds me of the Island of the
Lotus-Eaters from the Odyssey. The world is very interesting here
as it mixes together many standard themes from zombie stories and
other tropes of young adult fiction into a new mix. It's strange
how close humans live to the monsters without seemingly any
consequence when they reach the city in the North. I'm surprised in
general about how populated the world is. I found the ending to be

out well. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2015/">2015</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Pitch Perfect, starring Anna Kendrick (2002)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/26/Movie--Pitch-Perfect--starring-Anna-Kendrick--2002--0.html"/><updated>2016-02-26T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/26/Movie--Pitch-Perfect--starring-Anna-Kendrick--2002--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/02/26/Movie--Pitch-Perfect--starring-Anna-Kendrick--2002--0.html">Movie: Pitch Perfect, starring Anna Kendrick (2002)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/02/26/">26</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a very cute movie with a pretty unique plot.

too much talk about sex and things like that for my taste, but it

and there's no culmination of the plot lines related to the radio
and the guy there.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2002/">2002</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Extraction, starring Kellan Lutz (2015)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/24/Movie--Extraction--starring-Kellan-Lutz--2015--0.html"/><updated>2016-02-24T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/24/Movie--Extraction--starring-Kellan-Lutz--2015--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/02/24/Movie--Extraction--starring-Kellan-Lutz--2015--0.html">Movie: Extraction, starring Kellan Lutz (2015)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/02/24/">24</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a pretty bad movie in a lot of ways. There were definitely
things that I liked, such as the Gina Carano and the beginning
moments. But so much of the rest of the movie was pretty bad. It
was pretty embarrassing the way that they referred to Gina's
character as all sexy when she was just a total brick. There was
also absolutely no chemistry between the two leads. It's sad
because Haywire was so awesome.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2015/">2015</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Book: The Last Days of Socrates, by Plato with Christopher Rowe (2010)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/20/Book--The-Last-Days-of-Socrates--by-Plato-with-Christopher-Rowe--2010--0.html"/><updated>2016-02-20T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/02/20/Book--The-Last-Days-of-Socrates--by-Plato-with-Christopher-Rowe--2010--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/02/20/Book--The-Last-Days-of-Socrates--by-Plato-with-Christopher-Rowe--2010--0.html">Book: The Last Days of Socrates, by Plato with Christopher Rowe (2010)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/02/">02</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/02/20/">20</a></span></span><pre class="content">I've been reading this for a while.
