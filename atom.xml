    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember playing this game as a kid and thinking it was cool. I
just remember that it is an Action RPG. I played today for an
hour with my son and we beat the first dungeon. It&#8217;s very
fun. There&#8217;s a little too much grinding&#8230; I feel like I can&#8217;t
move forward and search, but I have to consciously try to get
money and EXP. But, it&#8217;s fun. The charge shot is essential for
staying out of harm, but it makes you less flexible, so it&#8217;s a
nice mechanic to put you in stressful situations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This whole chapter seems to be about Marie Taglioni and she sounds
amazing.</p>

<p>If Vestris designed the steps that became modern ballet, she
figured out how to do them with the style expect of modern
ballerinas. She did everything that Vestris did, but she practiced
so long and hard to achieve the strength necessary to do it in an
&#8220;elegant&#8221; and &#8220;feminine&#8221; way. While the early dancers were
&#8220;sweaty&#8221; and &#8220;breathless&#8221; when they did them, she was
&#8220;angelic&#8221;. She built this technique over 6 months after a failed
start in Vienna by working for 6 hours a day and holding poses for
100 seconds.</p>

<p>Her shoes are still extant and have been studied. While she
performed full pointe, she mainly held herself at full point and
did not dance on it. We know this because her shoes were not the
boxed and hard style that allows that. Instead, by looking at the
wearing at the shoes, it looks like she danced about half-way
between half-pointe and full-pointe. Her dancing was so powerful
that she used 2 or 3 shoes per performance.</p>

life as a boring analyst. Especially when his office mates are
talking about the intimate details of the lives of the people they
spy on. This is such a clever movie and it has so much great
acting. I greatly enjoy the disturbing way politics and personal
relationships get in the way of the right things happening. It&#8217;s
deliciously cynical.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just read one of the most interesting sections so far. It
discussed how in the 1820s, a ballet master named Vestris
dramatically changed the art.</p>

<p>He took the old three different genres of ballet and combined all
their steps into a new genre&#8212;that is modern ballet. This had lots
of big consequences. The old notation systems didn&#8217;t work any
longer and weren&#8217;t replaced because of the complexity of the new
dances.</p>

<p>The old style of practice was forgotten and replaced. Before, whole
dances were done continuously for practice, but after individual
steps were repeated dozens of times before going on to more
steps. The various steps were ranked in order of difficulty. For
example, in Vestris&#8217; notes it says there were 27 different kinds
of pirouettes.</p>

<p>In particular, the role of the male dancer changed a lot. Vestris
innovated the male dancer as acrobat doing many jumps and
turns. This was seen as very wild and distasteful. In addition,
the new style he came up with was perfected by women, so part of
his innovation led to male dancers becoming pariahs and not a
major part of ballet. In fact, in the mid 1800s, many male roles
were played by women! This is funny to me because a hundred years
before, the opposite was true.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played through this whole game&#8230; throughout the day&#8230; a
total of seven hours and eleven minutes! Woah! This is a great
game. I love these escape puzzle games.</p>

<p>There are fifty puzzles, so each took an average of eight minutes,
but I&#8217;d say most were either really short&#8230; like one or two
tries&#8230; or very long. I had to seek hints about five times. The
ones that were the hardest were ones where you need to push a
block half a tile, or cover a monster spawning location with a
block so it would appear somewhere else, or where you need really
precise timing. The biggest problem with the game is when Lolo
gets stuck on edges of the grid. Nevertheless, It&#8217;s a lot of fun
to play.</p>

<p>The graphics are simple and to the point, but super adorable. I
love the way Lolo runs.</p>

<p>My son had fun helping me and giving me advice during the game.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much more to say about it, but it&#8217;s very enjoyable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played three rounds and got to the boss of the first area both
times. This game is ridiculously bad. The controls are terrible
and basic mechanics are broken. For example, there&#8217;s no period of
invulnerability when you get hit and you get stunlocked in
place. There were times when I missed a jump, landed on an enemy,
and slowly lost all my health as I couldn&#8217;t move away.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game as a kid, but I don&#8217;t remember every
getting past the first stage. I guess I never will.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a really interesting game. It&#8217;s clear to me how Resident
Evil was inspired by this. The difficulties of managing the
various members of the party and piecing together the
multi-dimensional fetch quest is a very interesting (and pretty
unique) structure for a game.</p>

<p>I played reading a walk-through that was very particular about
where you should go and what you should do. I feel like it would
be bad to play this way, because the whole point of the game is
to explore this world. However, it seems like it is pretty brutal
in terms of what your lack of knowledge means. I think I will put
this on my &#8220;revisit&#8221; pile.</p>

<p>Given my short time with the game, the main problem with it is
that it is just a puzzle and there&#8217;s no good visceral feeling
associated with playing the game. The controls are pretty awkward
(knowing who is who is a pain in the beginning, but would
definitely get better as you played more) and the battle system is
uninteresting. The quick-time events are really fascinating. The
lack of an ability to see if a weapon is strong is
annoying. Overall, it&#8217;s been a bit of an obtuse but really
strangely modern game. I feel like a game like this could be made
really well today. I don&#8217;t think I can look past the flaws right
now though.</p>

<p>When I do play it again, I will have to re-rank it.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/Game&#8211;Square-s-Tom-Sawyer&#8211;NES&#8211;1989&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the existence of this game and I have been since
I heard that it existed. I played the game for about twenty
minutes in all Japanese. I was able to understand the menus, but I
didn&#8217;t do much more than sound out the dialogue. The graphics are
ridiculously racist. The concept of the game is nuts and based on
my brief playing and a glance at a walkthrough&#8230; it is
transparent fetch quest with RPG battles in between. In some way,
this can be said of all RPGs, but it would be far too transparent
for me, given my limited grasp of the language. I wasn&#8217;t able to
walk to the first fetch quest delivery point and back without
dying.</p>

<p>Grinding is really the worst thing for old RPGs. Many of them had
interesting mechanics, but were padded for their day. In more
modern times, this padding is really destructive if you want to
experience what was interesting about the game. There&#8217;s no good
way to use codes and cheats to give a challenging, but still
non-tedious experience. There are ways to just pre-load with
super powers and get infinite experience, but that&#8217;s little
better than just watching the game on YouTube.</p>

<p>As I get older I&#8217;m much more interested in games without
progression systems because from the second you start you&#8217;re
faced with a test to learn new skills and apply them. The tests
get harder, but there&#8217;s no artificial curve in the game. In other
games with internal progression systems, the progression is more
than just numeric&#8230; it requires more strategy and planning. For
example, Dragon Quest 1 is basically just about getting higher
numbers until you can get even higher numbers. There&#8217;s little
strategy involved&#8230; just a test of how much risk you&#8217;re willing
to take. In contrast, FF6 adds more party members, complicated
enemy patterns, many spells, etc as the game progresses.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where Tom Sawyer fits in this rubric, but I&#8217;m not
going to give it a chance. I have dipped into its existence and
found it very curious.</p>

out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn&#8217;t get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I&#8217;m doing terribly, but
it doesn&#8217;t communicate to me in any way what I&#8217;m doing wrong. In
addition, I&#8217;m now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games&#8230; even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can&#8217;t. Argh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game (via the prototype ROM dump) for a bit
today. It&#8217;s clear that this was the precursor to Earthbound. The
dialogue is great and the enemies are very odd.</p>

<p>It is also clear that it is a straight Dragon Quest clone. I was
not able to make it from the front door of my house to town
without dying. It took three trips before I reached a high enough
level to make it. When I got there, I had about $250 in cash, but
the next worthwhile weapon was $500. Classic. I started walking
around and was decimated by the first zombie on the way to the
cemetery (plot point #1).</p>

<p>During my short play, I noticed a few typos. This, combined with
the anticipatory pain of grinding, has led me to decide to replay
it on the Mother 1+2 remake for the GBA with the fan translation
that adds the &#8220;Easy Ring&#8221; option. I was definitely convinced that
I want to play this game, but not convinced by the NES version.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat three levels after about forty minutes of play. This game
is very similar to Super Mario Brothers 2. It&#8217;s focused around
picking up blocks and throwing them, although you can throw them
in more directions in this game. The co-op play is a memorable
feature, although I played by myself.</p>

<p>The platforming is pretty good, but the hit detection against
projectiles and enemies is too imprecise&#8230; you can get hits
registered that look very far away from your character. This
annoyance combined with the extreme speed of a lot of the enemies
(particularly the flying ones) leads to a lot of frustration. The
boss of the third level is really vicious because it zooms across
the screen and drops two moving creatures that have big hit
boxes.</p>

<p>The first boss fight is super easy once you realize what you need
to do and is pretty bland. The third is more interesting, but
also flawed because you can&#8217;t effective shot in mid-air because
you fall so quickly.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a C+ NES platformer. It&#8217;s not
horrific&#8230; it&#8217;s certainly playable (unlike TMNT, for instance)
but it by no means enters the canon, and I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s really
worth my time. If I could have used a Game Genie code to get
infinite lives, I would have done it though and taken one screen
at a time. As it stands, the three lives per continue and three
continues barrier is too high for me to go through imperfect
mechanics.</p>

last one. It seems a lot more deep and complex. It&#8217;s got this
non-linear-ness to it which is interesting, but the controls are
still pretty sloppy. There were many times when I just couldn&#8217;t
line up with an enemy and it was on top of me doing damage every
time it was possible. I&#8217;m still hopeful for the next sequel. But
this game doesn&#8217;t do it for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about a half-hour. I was a Human Female,
Human Male, Mutant Female, and Human Male. I sold my Saber, bought
some armor and went out to fight. It took the whole thirty minutes
to be able to afford one more piece of armor. I went out to fight
again and got into a fight with a Red Bull, during the course of
the fight, all my weapons broke and two of my characters died,
then the monster fled, so I didn&#8217;t get to kill and didn&#8217;t get any
gold. Now I don&#8217;t have the money to replace the weapons or revive
the fallen characters. This game seems like it will be nothing
but Kawazu brutalization and grinding. No thank you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for almost an hour tonight. It is brilliant in
its simple setup, but complex puzzles. The controls are
horrible&#8212;you can&#8217;t turn in mid-step, you can&#8217;t stop on stairs,
and you don&#8217;t always use a special attack when you think you
will. The graphics are horrific. The music is about 4 notes
repeated. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s a really addicting and satisfying
game. It&#8217;s neat that you can watch replays of your last
attempt. This game is very similar to Lolo-style games, but
different enough that it feels unique. I was very impressed.</p>

<p>On the Game Boy, apparently it has 80 levels, and I did 31. I
think I burnt myself out on it in the one sitting I did. I will
definitely play this again, and probably pick up where I was
before, but I&#8217;ll mark it as done because I think I understand the
game pretty thoroughly and (like the Crush games) I can&#8217;t really
binge on it.</p>

S&#8217;Winter one was pretty funny. Especially when Candace wins the
Limbo.</p>
