    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn&#8217;t continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent some time grinding today (about an hour) and then got all
the Twinkling Shards I needed to fully upgrade my Giant armor and
the Giant&#8217;s Hammer. It was pretty awesome once I did that. I then
fought the two bosses&#8230; I died the first time, but the second I
was more aggressive and got them down pretty quickly. After
getting the Lordvessel, I avenged the girl and advanced the
story. I feel like the end is in sight. I played for almost three
hours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished the book. I thought the ending was very exciting
but a little bit disappointing because we don&#8217;t find out what the
feels are of all the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; who gave up&#8212;like Ferris, etc. The
attitudes of the guards was very interesting. The very ending when
they are planning the rebuilding is cool. However, it&#8217;s unclear why
they think they&#8217;ll be able to prevent the same thing from
happening&#8230; there&#8217;s a little bit alluded to with the revision of
the Constitution. I think I would have liked a little bit more of a
vision of Utopia. Overall, it was definitely a masterpiece.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel&#8217;s Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I&#8217;d
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn&#8217;t kill him&#8230;). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave&#8230; which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain&#8230; and a major mistake to go down there. I think I&#8217;ll
grind for souls and just buy them.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Get 10 + X? twinkling (10 total &#8212; 4 3 2 1 &#8212; per item, I have
4 armor pieces)
- Trade each of the three clumps to snuggly for shards (x4)
- Upgrade Giant Armor to +5
- Kill Giant Blacksmith to get Hammer
- Upgrade Hammer to +5 (need 10 Twinkling)
- Upgrade Black Bow to +5
- Go to Demon Ruins to get Fire Ember

then got a ton (60!) fire buff items. I went against the bosses

boosted some levels, plus I found a new armor setup. I went to
fight the double bosses in Londo, but died both times I tried. The
second time, I got Ornstein down to one more hit before death. :(
I think I will try to upgrade my weapon to fire element&#8230; which

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a totally over the top movie. It&#8217;s silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some funny moments and characters&#8212;like the way the CIA
teams act on the &#8220;case&#8221; and Lauren&#8217;s friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the &#8220;super fast&#8221; type without much impact.</p>

<p>There a few moments of real romance&#8212;when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he&#8217;s watching Titantic and the look on Tuck&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there&#8217;s no meaning
behind their actions.</p>

<p>But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren&#8217;t really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t look at Lauren
enough when they&#8217;re talking&#8230; it&#8217;s very unnatural.)</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she&#8217;s trying too hard to look
sexy&#8230; particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other&#8230; it&#8217;s like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.</p>

boss and got some awesome equipment. At first when I tried to get
Pharis&#8217; bow, he fell off the cliff and so I didn&#8217;t get it. But
later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film.</p>

<p>I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they&#8217;re
fighting fear itself, but there&#8217;s no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The movie&#8217;s version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hank&#8217;s relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men&#8212;meaning in the government or &#8220;public&#8221;
sector&#8212;namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn&#8217;t respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus &#8220;pure love&#8221;. The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there&#8217;s no need for the concept of &#8220;love&#8221;. In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial &#8220;trade&#8221; and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.</p>

<p>It makes me think of Hayek&#8217;s comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the speech by Francisco at James&#8217; wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It&#8217;s like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don&#8217;t know that much more than the characters but it&#8217;s so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn&#8217;t occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven&#8217;t got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I&#8217;m just
impervious to thinking they are too long?</p>

<p>Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love&#8217;s interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I&#8217;m kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough &#8220;he said&#8221;/&#8221;she said&#8221; that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as &#8220;usability&#8221; problems with books.</p>

<p>For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I&#8217;m not
totally sure the speakers are correct:</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be &#8230; like this. Growing colder and things stopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hank: &#8220;I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;You did? Funny, I thought that, too.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It&#8217;s a fascinating book. I don&#8217;t find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be&#8230; it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to not compare the book&#8217;s story to the story of the
movie. I don&#8217;t know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.</p>

<p>For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It&#8217;s not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.</p>

<p>In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.</p>

<p>I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are &#8220;the
People&#8217;s state of such-and-such&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and got to the first boss of Anor
Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can&#8217;t really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen&#8217;s Fortress (Pit)
- Kill Poison Dragon and final girl in Painted World
- Go to Abyss
- Go to New Londo Ruins
- Go to Dragon Valley</p>
