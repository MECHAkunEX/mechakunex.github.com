    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch a new show and this was
recommended to us by some people. We watched it tonight on
Netflix. It was really awesome. Basically every scene was
amazing, clever, funny, etc. It had it all. I love that everyone
assumes they&#8217;re a couple. It&#8217;s cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a PC Engine and got this game. It is really fun to play
it again, especially without an emulator and save states, so I
have to do it better. Additionally, I&#8217;ve had a lot more
experience with the other early Castlevania games so I&#8217;m just
better at playing it. It&#8217;s really fun and smooth feeling, despite
having classic Casltevania stickiness.</p>

<p>I played only as Richter today and I did all secret exits. I went
from 0 to 1 to 2&#8217; to 3&#8217; to 4&#8217;. I fought the Serpent, the Minotaur,
the Werewolf, and the floaty head thing. It&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like &#8220;plays&#8221; but
should be like &#8220;paintings&#8221;, because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can&#8217;t express detailed, dynamic
stories&#8230; everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable&#8230; like a painting.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/11/04/Game&#8211;The-Legend-of-Zelda&#8211;Second-Quest&#8212;NES&#8211;1986&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year ago, I beat the first quest of Legend of Zelda. I&#8217;d
never really played the second quest, but I knew it existed, so
after doing Castlevania II, I decided to knock it out.</p>

<p>I played for about 2 hours and 15 minutes and got up to level 4
and had about 9 hearts and other stuff from the overworld. It was
very painful to gather all the money. I decided that I wanted to
buy the arrows and wanted to try the Money Making Game trick, but
I needed to plug in the second controller. I was scared of
accidentally bumping the NES and causing it to glitch, so I
figured I&#8217;d save first. I stupidly didn&#8217;t realize that when you
do &#8220;Continue&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t also save, so I just held down RESET,
saved the SRAM on my PowerPak, and rebooted. And thus I deleted
all my progress. Ouch.</p>

<p>I decided to play again, but with a Game Genie code to give me
more access to money, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do the rupee grinding
like I did the first time. It took about one hour to get back to
where I was before. Then another 2 and a half to win. 3:34 total.</p>

<p>This version of the game is much more difficult. There are parts
where you almost have to play it like a stealth game because you
are so limited in your ability to take damage.</p>

<p>I like that the maps are rearranged, but since I used online maps,
it didn&#8217;t really matter&#8230; I don&#8217;t have the patience to make my
own tools to do mapping for myself. I would never look at a map in
game like Castlevania (one of the Metroid-style ones) because the
in-game map system is so good. A game like Legend of Zelda that
had a really good map like there, maybe with the ability to make
notes like in Etrian Odyssey. That would be cool and you could
probably randomly generate the maps to have infinite fun. I wonder
if it would be too much like Sudoku though (in the sense that you
would always start off by trying to find the Blue Ring and then
the Candle, etc, etc.)</p>

<p>I liked the final message: &#8220;You are great. You have an amazing
wisdom and power.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through this game today using a walkthrough, maps, and
an infinite lives/hearts code. I feel like the hearts code was
essential so I didn&#8217;t have to grind. The lives code didn&#8217;t seem
to make much of a difference, because the game is pretty easy
(re: Egoraptor&#8217;s dissection of its layout problems.) The
walkthrough and maps were definitely essential because it is so
confusing and backwards. I feel like there wasn&#8217;t really anything
valuable in this game, although the mechanics felt good, but it
just wasn&#8217;t anywhere near as challenging as Castlevania 1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a crazy movie. It is very disturbing, but in a way that is
always beneath the surface in a hidden way. The double layered
fantasy world that the girls live in is terrible, but what&#8217;s most
disturbing is that it is hiding a worse world. The fantasy within
that is really insane and feels very Japanese in its absurdity. I
liked that about it a lot. The visual effects and photography were
really interesting and different&#8212;particularly the beginning
sequence was crazy.</p>

few times and got all the secret items on their stages. I think I

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read most of the first chapter today, although I decided it was
a bit long and I should break my reading into smaller chunks. It
was very interesting to read about the philosophical origins of
the art. The idea that entertainment before was more loud and that
ballet was distinguished by silence is cool. The Feuillet notation
is crazy to read&#8230; it looks so meaningless to me. The debate
about whether dance should be considered part of music is curious,
especially given modern university organization. Finally, reading
about all the ways male dance was preferred to female dance is
very strange to a modern, such as myself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the introduction today. I was very interested to learn that
the current ballet canon is very Russian, but made by a French guy,
and very late in the life of ballet. The concept of there being
very little data about the past of ballet is curious. I like the
idea that the story of this book will focus on the steps and forms
themselves. It seems like a style I would be most intrigued by.</p>

score. I don&#8217;t know what it would mean to &#8220;beat&#8221; this game. In
addition, every time I play, even when I last longer, I don&#8217;t
really feel like I did anything good since you can manage to get
back down to a blank screen so often. Another thing strange about
this game is that the difficulty never really changes, I just
feel like I keep going and going and going but the soundtrack
changes. It&#8217;s odd.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour today. I&#8217;m trying to beat the Pro VS
match. I tried first and the match lasted 15 minutes and I
ultimately lost after a good run of wins. I decided to try &#8220;Easy
Mode&#8221; to see how easy it was&#8230; and I lost twice and then won,
but failed on 3-5 twice. Easy doesn&#8217;t really seem that much
easier and it&#8217;s not worth having the green medal on the score
icon. I feel like I&#8217;m at a bit of a wall in this game and should
play it a lot less.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to schedule it for a weekly session on Sunday morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and half this morning. I got stars in every
beginner event. I did 1-5 as Chang and I beat Isabella in Sudden
Death on the third hole. It was very intense. Also, in 1-5 I got
a crown. I haven&#8217;t figured out how to find out what will give you
a crown though. Everything seemed a lot easier with Change
because he had so much power, but it also seems like the
characters aren&#8217;t really supposed to be better than one-another,
but just represent different play styles. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played all night while chatting and burping my
new baby. I got stars up to 3-4 and did the Pro VS match twice. In
the first one, I lost after just a few holes and in the second I
had her tied until the second to last hole, then lost by one
stroke in the last. Ouch. It&#8217;s a very fun game. But I might be
playing too much :/</p>
