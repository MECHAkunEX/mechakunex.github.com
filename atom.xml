First, I did some
hunting of leopards to get their skin to finance getting the
garden built at the Homestead. Then, I gathered plants to sell and
made a lot of money so that I could buy the Predator sniper rifle
and finish the Homestead. I was annoyed that nothing seemed to
really happy when I did and the Shrine wasn't even cool, it's just
a dopey source of a little money.

After that, I flew the Buzzer around and destroyed all the Pagan's
Wrath convoys from the air with grenades. I didn't realize that
they wouldn't just go away before, so I wanted them to be clear
while I explore the area. As I did that, I stopped at lots of
Unknown Locations to pick up their stuff and explore.

Once I did that, I did two Campaign missions to defend the
Monastery and then go to the Himalayas. When I was in the
Himalayas, I gathered all the Snow Leopard skins I need. Now, I
just need to get some Sambar skins and then I'm all set until I
unlock more Fashion Week events in the North. I think that I will
basically just be working on Campaign missions for a while.

I did the Eastern one almost totally from the sky, but then got
down and shot down a reinforcement helicopter with an RPG. After
that, I only had a single enemy left to take out on the ground.

I did the Western one from the air as well, but it wasn't as
useful because the fortress is so embedded in the mountain. The
big problem is that the reinforcements didn't come until I went
deep enough, so I had to then run out and shoot them down with the
RPG. It worked pretty well. After that, I stood at the top of the
hole and threw grenades and shot my bow down at the enemies. I was
able to do it without being in any real danger.

After that, I did some vehicle escort missions so I could unlock
the ability to buy the Predator sniper rifle. Of course, I don't
have enough money yet, so I'll have figure out so way to get rich
quick. :)

Maybe I will eventually start doing the campaign missions. In
particular, I want to be able to get Snow Leopard skins.

started expanding the Ghale Homestead. The Shangri-la missions are
pretty fun and introduce a new way to do the combat which is
enjoyable, although sometimes I just sprint to the next checkpoint
because it is a smarter strategy.

I also took over all the southern outposts. For the two alarm
ones, I used a new technique which is getting in the Buzzer and
raining grenades down from the sky. What a silly, fun way to do
it!

Once I had taken them over, I got access to some Fashion Week
missions, which I did as well. At this point in my crafting, I
just need to get Snow Leopard skins and the rare animals. I'm
annoyed that there are no Snow Leopards in the south.

Finally, I did a few attempts at using the Buzzer to attack the
fortresses, but with no luck. I can't seem to get all that alarms
fast enough and then the attack helicopters take me down. I
presume I just need to find a good angle and
practice. Unfortunately, every time I fail costs money. :(

between the two choices. I spent a little time gathering some
resources and then I went to the Ghale Homestead for the first
time. The arena was pretty intense and took me a few tries.

The first thing I
did was focus on getting the harder animal skins. At the end of
yesterday's session, I bought the Elephant Rider skill, so I
decided to try that out to get around and hunt rhinos near the
river in the south. It worked out very well, because other animals
don't attack the elephant (just soldiers do.) This basically means
you just have to chase them down. I was able to gather everything
I needed. The only animals I have left to skin are Snow Leopards,
which don't appear to be on the Southern map at all.

After that, I spent the rest of the time going from one outpost to
another taking it over. Normally what I've been doing is sending
an RPG at the alarm, then slowly stealth killing with the bow from
a distance. However, on a few of them, I've been harassed by
Dholes as hide in the forest. Somehow on two occasions I was able
to get the Dholes to go into the outpost and attack. This led to
two different takeovers being culminated by the animals, which I
found a little funny.

I only have a few more outposts in the South before I move on to
my next goal. My options are: try to take over a fortress, gather
all the collectibles, or do real campaign missions. I think it
would be cool to do the fortress, but the map screen says that you
need to weaken them by campaign missions. I'm going to read about
that online and see what exactly it entails, because it would be
very fun to do it without that advantage.

each of the outposts next and liberate them, then I'll go back and
get all the collectibles in the area.

I did a ton of objectives on the
map but only a few actual missions. Once I got the second outpost
and started opening up the map... it was pretty crazy to see how
big it was and how (in principle) there's no reason I can't just
go anywhere immediately. I suspect that lots of "open world" games
are like this, but I basically never play them, so it is pretty
crazy to me.

I have been spending a lot of time hunting animals to do all the
crafting. Some animals are really annoying to hunt, because it
feels like they never actually spawn where it says that they
will. In particular, rhinos don't seem to spawn and are very hard
to kill. What I really need to hunt down right now are Yaks,
because they stand in the way of a bunch of upgrades.

I like climbing up to something high and jumping off of it. I feel
like the wingsuit and parachute should be automatic though, I
don't always press the button on time.

misunderstanding, come out." It makes me wonder if you could turn
yourself in and get out.

The game is very gorgeous and I feel major OCD impulses from
looking at the map screen. I'm trying to gather things and learn
how to use the weapons. I would like to focus on the bow and I
would like to hunt a lot of animals before getting deep into the

As someone who knows Salt Lake City really well, it was kind of
disappointing that it didn't look very accurate. I'm glad they
included the temple, because it is iconic, but it was in the
totally wrong place and didn't even look very accurate. There
wasn't even a Moroni on top!

The ending of the main game was pretty intense. I felt like the
combat had a nice conclusion and the emotional impact of Joel's
choice was pretty intense. It was kind of crazy how the doctors
were totally defenseless at the end.

I really liked the Left Behind DLC. The story reveals in the
flashback were pretty touching. I was getting lesbian vibes for
most of it and wasn't too surprised when they kissed. It feels
really cheap and fan-fic-y to do that though. I really liked the
part where she plays the game. It was very cute and fun.

The non-flashback part was really intense. It took a lot of what I
liked about the main game and crammed it into a tight
experience. I was able to do lots of stealth and there was lots of
impact in the story telling. I think my favourite little detail
was when Ellie ignored the comic in the pharmacy because she's
just thinking about Joel.

relatively short bursts. I played up until you get to the entrance
of the SLC area. I really liked the part when you play as
Ellie. It was easily the best part of the game so far. It had a
lot of powerful melding of the gameplay and the story, which the
game doesn't normally do and it created some consequences for all
the violence and destruction that occurs earlier in the story.
