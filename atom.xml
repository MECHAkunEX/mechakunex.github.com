    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played through this whole game&#8230; throughout the day&#8230; a
total of seven hours and eleven minutes! Woah! This is a great
game. I love these escape puzzle games.</p>

<p>There are fifty puzzles, so each took an average of eight minutes,
but I&#8217;d say most were either really short&#8230; like one or two
tries&#8230; or very long. I had to seek hints about five times. The
ones that were the hardest were ones where you need to push a
block half a tile, or cover a monster spawning location with a
block so it would appear somewhere else, or where you need really
precise timing. The biggest problem with the game is when Lolo
gets stuck on edges of the grid. Nevertheless, It&#8217;s a lot of fun
to play.</p>

<p>The graphics are simple and to the point, but super adorable. I
love the way Lolo runs.</p>

<p>My son had fun helping me and giving me advice during the game.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much more to say about it, but it&#8217;s very enjoyable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played three rounds and got to the boss of the first area both
times. This game is ridiculously bad. The controls are terrible
and basic mechanics are broken. For example, there&#8217;s no period of
invulnerability when you get hit and you get stunlocked in
place. There were times when I missed a jump, landed on an enemy,
and slowly lost all my health as I couldn&#8217;t move away.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game as a kid, but I don&#8217;t remember every
getting past the first stage. I guess I never will.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a really interesting game. It&#8217;s clear to me how Resident
Evil was inspired by this. The difficulties of managing the
various members of the party and piecing together the
multi-dimensional fetch quest is a very interesting (and pretty
unique) structure for a game.</p>

<p>I played reading a walk-through that was very particular about
where you should go and what you should do. I feel like it would
be bad to play this way, because the whole point of the game is
to explore this world. However, it seems like it is pretty brutal
in terms of what your lack of knowledge means. I think I will put
this on my &#8220;revisit&#8221; pile.</p>

<p>Given my short time with the game, the main problem with it is
that it is just a puzzle and there&#8217;s no good visceral feeling
associated with playing the game. The controls are pretty awkward
(knowing who is who is a pain in the beginning, but would
definitely get better as you played more) and the battle system is
uninteresting. The quick-time events are really fascinating. The
lack of an ability to see if a weapon is strong is
annoying. Overall, it&#8217;s been a bit of an obtuse but really
strangely modern game. I feel like a game like this could be made
really well today. I don&#8217;t think I can look past the flaws right
now though.</p>

<p>When I do play it again, I will have to re-rank it.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/Game&#8211;Square-s-Tom-Sawyer&#8211;NES&#8211;1989&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the existence of this game and I have been since
I heard that it existed. I played the game for about twenty
minutes in all Japanese. I was able to understand the menus, but I
didn&#8217;t do much more than sound out the dialogue. The graphics are
ridiculously racist. The concept of the game is nuts and based on
my brief playing and a glance at a walkthrough&#8230; it is
transparent fetch quest with RPG battles in between. In some way,
this can be said of all RPGs, but it would be far too transparent
for me, given my limited grasp of the language. I wasn&#8217;t able to
walk to the first fetch quest delivery point and back without
dying.</p>

<p>Grinding is really the worst thing for old RPGs. Many of them had
interesting mechanics, but were padded for their day. In more
modern times, this padding is really destructive if you want to
experience what was interesting about the game. There&#8217;s no good
way to use codes and cheats to give a challenging, but still
non-tedious experience. There are ways to just pre-load with
super powers and get infinite experience, but that&#8217;s little
better than just watching the game on YouTube.</p>

<p>As I get older I&#8217;m much more interested in games without
progression systems because from the second you start you&#8217;re
faced with a test to learn new skills and apply them. The tests
get harder, but there&#8217;s no artificial curve in the game. In other
games with internal progression systems, the progression is more
than just numeric&#8230; it requires more strategy and planning. For
example, Dragon Quest 1 is basically just about getting higher
numbers until you can get even higher numbers. There&#8217;s little
strategy involved&#8230; just a test of how much risk you&#8217;re willing
to take. In contrast, FF6 adds more party members, complicated
enemy patterns, many spells, etc as the game progresses.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where Tom Sawyer fits in this rubric, but I&#8217;m not
going to give it a chance. I have dipped into its existence and
found it very curious.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played twenty minutes of Monkey Watch today. I couldn&#8217;t make it
out of the practice again. I was able to reliably hit the yellow
monkeys but couldn&#8217;t get the purple ones at all. Not a single
time. This game is very frustrating. I&#8217;m doing terribly, but
it doesn&#8217;t communicate to me in any way what I&#8217;m doing wrong. In
addition, I&#8217;m now blocked from doing any other of the
mini-games&#8230; even though they will definitely test different
rhythm skills than this one. I want to play this game and
experience more, but I can&#8217;t. Argh.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game (via the prototype ROM dump) for a bit
today. It&#8217;s clear that this was the precursor to Earthbound. The
dialogue is great and the enemies are very odd.</p>

<p>It is also clear that it is a straight Dragon Quest clone. I was
not able to make it from the front door of my house to town
without dying. It took three trips before I reached a high enough
level to make it. When I got there, I had about $250 in cash, but
the next worthwhile weapon was $500. Classic. I started walking
around and was decimated by the first zombie on the way to the
cemetery (plot point #1).</p>

<p>During my short play, I noticed a few typos. This, combined with
the anticipatory pain of grinding, has led me to decide to replay
it on the Mother 1+2 remake for the GBA with the fan translation
that adds the &#8220;Easy Ring&#8221; option. I was definitely convinced that
I want to play this game, but not convinced by the NES version.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I beat three levels after about forty minutes of play. This game
is very similar to Super Mario Brothers 2. It&#8217;s focused around
picking up blocks and throwing them, although you can throw them
in more directions in this game. The co-op play is a memorable
feature, although I played by myself.</p>

<p>The platforming is pretty good, but the hit detection against
projectiles and enemies is too imprecise&#8230; you can get hits
registered that look very far away from your character. This
annoyance combined with the extreme speed of a lot of the enemies
(particularly the flying ones) leads to a lot of frustration. The
boss of the third level is really vicious because it zooms across
the screen and drops two moving creatures that have big hit
boxes.</p>

<p>The first boss fight is super easy once you realize what you need
to do and is pretty bland. The third is more interesting, but
also flawed because you can&#8217;t effective shot in mid-air because
you fall so quickly.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say this is a C+ NES platformer. It&#8217;s not
horrific&#8230; it&#8217;s certainly playable (unlike TMNT, for instance)
but it by no means enters the canon, and I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s really
worth my time. If I could have used a Game Genie code to get
infinite lives, I would have done it though and taken one screen
at a time. As it stands, the three lives per continue and three
continues barrier is too high for me to go through imperfect
mechanics.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for a bit. It&#8217;s definitely better than the
last one. It seems a lot more deep and complex. It&#8217;s got this
non-linear-ness to it which is interesting, but the controls are
still pretty sloppy. There were many times when I just couldn&#8217;t
line up with an enemy and it was on top of me doing damage every
time it was possible. I&#8217;m still hopeful for the next sequel. But
this game doesn&#8217;t do it for me.</p>

Mario in Portable form! Today, there&#8217;s no reason to play
this. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s bad&#8230; but the limitations of the Game
Boy are way too awkward to really enjoy it. There are some cool
things though, such as the rolling boulders and the different
enemy types, but there&#8217;s no reason to play this when you&#8217;re at
home (or even with the hand-held options that are available
today.)</p>

Human Male, Mutant Female, and Human Male. I sold my Saber, bought
some armor and went out to fight. It took the whole thirty minutes
to be able to afford one more piece of armor. I went out to fight
again and got into a fight with a Red Bull, during the course of
the fight, all my weapons broke and two of my characters died,
then the monster fled, so I didn&#8217;t get to kill and didn&#8217;t get any
gold. Now I don&#8217;t have the money to replace the weapons or revive
the fallen characters. This game seems like it will be nothing
but Kawazu brutalization and grinding. No thank you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for almost an hour tonight. It is brilliant in
its simple setup, but complex puzzles. The controls are
horrible&#8212;you can&#8217;t turn in mid-step, you can&#8217;t stop on stairs,
and you don&#8217;t always use a special attack when you think you
will. The graphics are horrific. The music is about 4 notes
repeated. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s a really addicting and satisfying
game. It&#8217;s neat that you can watch replays of your last
attempt. This game is very similar to Lolo-style games, but
different enough that it feels unique. I was very impressed.</p>

<p>On the Game Boy, apparently it has 80 levels, and I did 31. I
think I burnt myself out on it in the one sitting I did. I will
definitely play this again, and probably pick up where I was
before, but I&#8217;ll mark it as done because I think I understand the
game pretty thoroughly and (like the Crush games) I can&#8217;t really
binge on it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for about an hour today. I used an emulator and
couldn&#8217;t resist save states. In the beginning, I worked my way
through on my own, using saves at each screen. I had no sense of
what the items would do, so I didn&#8217;t really buy any. After a
while, I looked at a walkthrough (which basically just recommended
which items to buy) and learned that I missed a few essential
hidden items. I restarted and made it to stage 4 following the
guide. I went away to eat, paused, and when I came back, the game
had reset itself.</p>

<p>This game looks and sounds really good, especially for its
age. It&#8217;s cute and has some interesting mechanics. I think of it
as a lot like Zelda 2, but with a less interesting combat system,
sloppier mechanics, and a more advanced inventory system. I found
the jumps to feel really wrong and the combat delays to be pretty
painful. The inventory system, once you realize what things are,
is neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that this is a pretty amazing game for its age,
but that a lot about it works against it. The biggest problem is
the lack of continues. The game is too deep on a customization
level to make sense as an arcade game. I presume that later
version of the game change this, because they were designed for
consoles. Secondly, the sprites are a bit too big and they make
it hard to see what&#8217;s going on. Third, the jumps and fighting
don&#8217;t feel quite right.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t play this, but I&#8217;m excited to investigate other games in
this series.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like Alien Crush, this game is a very exciting and interesting
pinball table. I feel like this game is a lot crazier because
after the initial ideas in Alien Crush, they were able to go all
out. There&#8217;s lots moving around on the course, there&#8217;s three
layers, and many complicated dependencies between
pieces. In that sense, it&#8217;s much better. Plus, they added a
pass-the-controller 2-player option, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ball physics feel much worse and the ball seems
totally outside of your control. I think part of it is that the
board is broken into three screens and each one is squatter (and
thus more detailed) than any screen was in Alien Crush. At the end
of the day, the game feels worse, despite looking much cooler.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I could imagine playing this game a lot&#8230; if not
for the interface friction.</p>

<p>When I played, my dad and I did the pass-the-controller for a
bit. My best score was 3.7 mil. I got this by getting the castle
on the bottom and then just being super cautious whenever I was
on the bottom screen. It worked like a charm!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while today on an emulator. This game is
gorgeous and amazingly detailed. I love the &#8220;living&#8221; board
concept and it works really well. The hit detection on the bottom
on the paddles seems a bit off, but it&#8217;s not too hard to get used
to.</p>

<p>I got a 1.3 mil score and my dad got 4.7 mil. It was fun to pass
the game back and forth. But, for me, there&#8217;s not enough of a
carrot to chase after, because I don&#8217;t really have a good concept
of what scores are possible and most of my deaths felt random &amp;
weren&#8217;t learning experiences.</p>

<p>I enjoy the game a lot, although I&#8217;m not sure how much I
like <em>this</em> game and how much I just like pinball. In any case,
the problem with the game is the amount of friction it takes to
setup and play for how long would be optimal. I can imagine
playing this for 10 minutes at a time, but it would take at least
5 to get everything ready to play it. This game (with what is
available today to be entertained with) needs some external
scheduling and a speedy front-end.</p>
