The second Walder appeared, I knew
exactly hat was going to happen and it was so epic. Later, when
we see her with the Lannister soldiers, you can tell that she is
ready to kill every single one of them, but then realizes they
are just poor people forced to do it. It is very sad and sweet.

I'm excited about the Hound hanging out with Tormund!

Jon's plans for securing the North are so awesome. (Especially
assigning Tormund to the Wall.) I love that all the kids and
women will be conscripted. It really shows how seriously he takes
it all. I love the idea that the fate of the world and
responsibility is on all these children, and this is shown
excellently by having the Umber and Karstark children take
oaths... they must be really grateful.

You can tell that Baelish is going to do something really bad
though.

I assume that we are seeing undead Giants, because they will be
very effective at attacking the Wall.

I love that Bran has seen Ned and clearly knows a lot about the
other people in the world from his visions.

Cersei's map and the subtle reason for its creation is great. Now
that she's unrestrained... I think she's going to be doing some
horrible things. Although, when she turns to drink in the middle
of the scene, you can tell that she is trying to hide from her
responsibility. Her delusions about her enemies are intense.

Euron's speech is so ridiculous.

I loved Sam's sequence... it was so excellently shot and epicly
done. The Archmaester's dismissal of Sam's concerns are so lame
but it makes sense given his perspective.

Daenerys's scene was cool, because Dragonstone looks so cool, but
I do wish we heard more from her.

Dany's plan seems good (although we'll see at the end of the
episode, that she should have destroyed Euron's fleet with her
dragons first.)

The Grey Worm sex scene was very sweet.

Randall Tarly coming back is a great example of GoT twisting the
knife... we love Sam and hate Cersei, so it will be said to see
Sam on the other side from his father. It was interesting to hear
Cersei describe Dany, because she's literally true but we see
Dany's actions totally differently.

Petyr is so dangerous, and Jon choking him is reminiscent of the
same thing happening with Ned before he dies... I feel like he's
going to get Sansa to do something really stupid while Jon is
away. Sansa cares a lot about the independence of the North,
while Jon just wants to defend the Realms of Men. I think this
will be a big conflict between them.

Arya's reuniting with Nymeria was awesome, although it would have
been even better if she got a new companion. Her conversation
with Hot Pie was great too.

I love that Sam is going to save Jorah. It's so fun when
characters from different storylines meet up.

Yara's defeat was very surprising. Whenever two named characters
from opposing sides are on screen... you know nothing good will
happen. I think on one hand though it is predicable, because
there is more drama is Dany has some loses.

I kind of cannot believe that Theon would be so cowardly.     </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Mario no Super Picross (SNES, 1995) (17)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/07/25/Game--Mario-no-Super-Picross--SNES--1995--16.html"/><updated>2017-07-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/07/25/Game--Mario-no-Super-Picross--SNES--1995--16.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/07/25/Game--Mario-no-Super-Picross--SNES--1995--16.html">Game: Mario no Super Picross (SNES, 1995) (17)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/07/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">I did a bunch of levels.

conversation with the Greyjoys is great. Ramsay is so evil, but
you can see why his plan worked... Jon is too passionate.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 6 - Episode 10 - The Winds of Winter (3)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-6---Episode-10---The-Winds-of-Winter-2.html"/><updated>2017-07-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2017/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-6---Episode-10---The-Winds-of-Winter-2.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2017/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-6---Episode-10---The-Winds-of-Winter-2.html">Game of Thrones - Season 6 - Episode 10 - The Winds of Winter (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2017/">2017</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2017/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2017/07/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">Cersei's ring is totally rad.

Floor 8, Lots of close calls.

Floor 9, A hard layout and very little dust.

Floor 10, This was really hard because I kept having my crystal
attacked and it just snowballed a lot.

Floor 11, I explored a lot of the floor, but left after running
out one direction and having no more dust to power that side of
the floor.

Floor 12, I went the wrong direction, but then ran out as I found
the exit and won! Woot.

I had fun with this game, but can't really imagine wanting to play
it again. The game makes a lot of sense and is pretty
straight-forward to play. I can tell that they tried very hard to
add lots and lots of other things to it so that there would be
depth to it, but I didn't find anything other than Food and the
dinky offensive Pods to be useful at all. I don't have much of an
interesting in trying the other things, because it would just seem
like an artificial constraint.
