    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two and half hours tonight. I&#8217;ve been taking a
break from games as I catch up on some work. I went up to the part
in the game where you are reunited with your kids after being a
statue and are looking for your wife. It was a really cool
sequence to be stone and then meet your kids. This game is just
sooo adorable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very cool movie. I thought they did a great job setting
up Cat Woman and Blake as interesting characters. I liked all the
tragedy and doubt that was part of the plot&#8230; it made it more
dramatic. It&#8217;s also cool how they incorporated the
Bane-destroys-Batman storyline from the comic. All around there was
cool stuff. I&#8217;m glad that they allowed the ending to really be an
ending.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Bane&#8217;s voice was a little too hard to
understand in a few key moments&#8230; it made me want subtitles, which
of course you can&#8217;t have in a theatre.</p>

<p>Despite Nolan&#8217;s insistence that the movie is not anti-Occupy, I
think it very much is. It shows the commies for what they really
are: blood-thirsty.</p>

temple and got some items in the world. My son really enjoys
watching it.</p>

<p>Today we played up to the boss in the Tower of Hera, but were
totally creamed. It is tough. I keep getting knocked off and then
his health is reset.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun, fast-paced action movie. I liked how the world of
the future was very different, but there was no explanation of why
or how or in what way. It just looked really foreign, which was
pretty cool. The two lead villains were very crazy and
interesting. The main character, Snow, was very wise-cracking and
fun. Overall, the movie was a fun ride.</p>

interested in it. Normally I try to stay away from shows that are
not completed, but I made an exception because she was so
interested.</p>

<p>The first episode was very cool. They&#8217;ve laid out a lot of thick
plot and interesting characters. I quite like it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought my son might like this game, given how much he enjoyed
watching the beginning of Castlevania: SOTN. I also thought he
might be willing to play it because the controls are simpler. I
was right. He really enjoyed watching the beginning and then all
of sudden he said, &#8220;Dad, how do you move? How do you attack? Can I
try?&#8221; He explored the world a little and fought some enemies. He
started getting frustrated because he kept dying. His problem was
that he wouldn&#8217;t move away from enemies when they came to attack
him. He would swing his sword while the enemies were on top of him
and this killed him eventually.</p>

<p>We got to the boss of the first temple, but I died during the
stomping part.</p>

won. Then we did Hard Man (couldn&#8217;t get past the second monkey)
and Gemini Man and then they got bored so we switched to a different

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie was suggested by Netflix and I wasn&#8217;t sure I would like
it. As we watched it, it was pretty cute and touching. It was very
reminiscent of how my wife and I were when we first met&#8230; fell in
love over the course of 10 days and then didn&#8217;t see each for
months. I was really surprised when she dumped him and then years
and years past&#8230; it was a very depressing and unhappy ending.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a great movie. Every character was very exciting and they
did a great job spreading out the interesting scenes for the
different characters. The only characters that weren&#8217;t totally
awesome were Hawkeye and Black Widow, because they weren&#8217;t really
super heroes&#8230; more &#8220;super spys&#8221; and that didn&#8217;t seem to fit as
well. Also, I thought Hawkeye was a bit too shallow of a
character&#8230; the actor played him too &#8220;cool&#8221; and above-it-all.</p>

<p>There were some awesome jokes and funny moments. One of my
favourites was when Captain America, reacting to hearing that Thor
and Loki are gods, says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, there&#8217;s only one God, and I don&#8217;t
think He dresses like that.&#8221; Not only was it delivered really well,
but it&#8217;s such a great comment for his character as the epitome of
America.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was great too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We were curious how much of the documentary-style of the pilot
would continue to the show. It is very similar. I&#8217;m surprised
that in this episode they didn&#8217;t show a football game. I get the
impression that every episode will be one week of time,
culminating in the game.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rally girl&#8221; thing was funny. And it was very sweet when
Jason got his treat even though he wasn&#8217;t playing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife has been wanting to watch this show for a while, based on
the recommendation of her good friend. I can&#8217;t think of that many
things that I care less about than football, so I&#8217;ve been
dragging my feet about watching it.</p>

<p>I found the first episode to be interesting. It is very
predictable in the plot development. The characters mostly play
to type, but they have a very real quality to them&#8230; like they
could be real people out there in a world that I know nothing
about (Texas, and Football.)</p>

<p>I really like the movie Varsity Blues and this is very
reminiscent of it. The small-town quaintness is cute and it is
interesting to learn about something I know nothing about.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed that no character in the show expressed
the idea that Jason&#8217;s sacrifice was not worth it and that one
game or football itself is not worth ruining your life
over. Hopefully that will come up later.</p>

<p>I very much like the amount of faith in the show.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d never read Jane Eyre before, but didn&#8217;t have very big
expectations for this movie. It was very well done and pretty
fascinating. I found the story to go very slowly and have a really
unpredictable structure. I expected to learn more about the
boarding school, but did not. I expected to learn more about her
job after meeting the Rivers, but did not. It seemed like it was
going to be a horror story before the old wife is revealed. After
getting through my expectations, it was very enjoyable.</p>

had lots of cute experiences in the game. I really like the towns
in this game&#8230; they feel much more fleshed out and real than
towns in most RPGs. I decided to marry Deborah because I think her
sprite is really cool and I thought she&#8217;d be funny. So far she has
been really hilarious with all her little comments. I like it a
lot. The wedding voes were really funny because they said &#8220;until
you stop getting resurrected at church when you die&#8221; instead of
&#8220;until death do you part&#8221;&#8230; thus acknowledging that the
characters really do die and get resurrected in the story. It was
really funny.</p>

super hero movies I&#8217;ve seen. It turned out to be very good. I think
my favourite parts were the bravery of Steve in the
beginning&#8230; like when he jumped on the grenade&#8230; and then the
great way they sold the crazy Captain America costume. I think it
worked really well. It was kind of disappointing that the romance
didn&#8217;t really get anywhere, but it was very romantic the way he had
her picture in his compass. The thing in the promo film was super
cute. Overall, a good movie. I&#8217;m excited to see The Avengers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finished watching it.</p>

<p>The LP was done really really well. I appreciated
SuperGreatFriend&#8217;s commentary as he went, livening up the slow
moments, like long combat sequences. He had some really funny
things too&#8230; like singing into the mic at the Galaxy of
Terror. Priceless! He was very thoughtful in other things, like
not showing cards with spoilers until the end, etc.</p>

<p>The game itself was really fascinating. The reveals at the end
were wild. As crazy as this game is in the beginning&#8230; it is SO
Japanese in the insanity that takes place at the end of the
game. Awesome.</p>

<p>I listened to the WAHP interview with SWERY again and found it
cool. I also noticed during the credits that there is a character
for every letter in the alphabet! Cool!</p>

<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed with the book. Almost 99% of the
book is: have standards and stick to them. Motherhood and apple
pie. The most interesting thing was not how &#8220;smart&#8221; the &#8220;great&#8221;
companies were, but how stupid their competitors were.</p>

<p>I have a very hard time applying it to my career, but I can&#8217;t
really go into that.</p>
