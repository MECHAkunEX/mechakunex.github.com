day. I got to the end of the 8th floor of the Zhonecage, but
haven't gotten an expensive enough item to get to the 9th
floor. I was about to get the spheres for Malik and Pascal, which
is pretty exciting. I'll be working at getting the other ones. I
really dislike grinding for random items (in general), so I feel
like I might give up get 100% everything in this game because it
will be necessary to grind shards and these spheres to get
everything. That's so annoying. I really dislike it when games
make you play in a way that makes you hate them at the end. I'm
fine with random drops, but the chance should be high enough that
after beating the game, you should have a few of everything from
fighting them throughout the game.

get as much 100% stuff as I can. I initially tried to kill the
last boss in 60 secs but didn't come really close even on Easy. I
think I need to buff up a lot more.

I then made a list of all the various items I hadn't yet collected
so I could begin getting them. This required, among other things,
going back to World's Eye to get some more Legendary Metal, which
was very painful. But I tricked the game by Saving &amp; Loading to
get the Discovery to regenerate.

I took a break for a while and played again in the evening for an
hour and a half. I went to Zhonecage and beat levels 1, 2,
and 3. I accidentally set my difficulty to Easy a few times and
then Chaos for the others (but I should have just done Evil, since
I want the Spheres.) This means I've got to do those levels again
if I want them. Bummer.

For the first thing, I
beat Poisson, using basically the same technique as last time,
but she didn't get to use her Mystic Artes on me, so I won.

During the session there were a lot of cute skits. There was a
great one of Hubert complaining about how scandalous Richard's
final battle costume was; one where Cheria thought she was too fat
and broke the elevator because she had a sweet potato; one where
Lambda tells Pascal to figure something out herself and then ruins
her discovery by revealing it at the last moment. It's great
stuff. :) An odd thing I noticed today in a lot of the scenes was
that Lords, Kings, Leaders, etc all have lots of paperwork to do
and it defines their life. I think game was made in Japan. :)

I did the final dungeon and final battle. The very last area was
very beautiful and the last battle was pretty insane. I loved the
whole counter thing, although I'm not sure how you'd know to do
it.

The ending is nice. I think Sophie's new getup looks
awesome... too bad it doesn't unlock a title so you can have her
like that all the time. I also thought the resolution of the
various romances was sweet.

I loaded up New Game+ to see what my grade was: 1774. I think I
can do a little bit more dualizing, plus some of the EX Dungeon
to get it higher. I intend to do that. Unfortunately, I missed
some skits and side-quests early on, so I can't possibly get
those 100%. Grr.

I am
really enjoying all the skits about Hubert and Pascal. It is very
cute. I especially like how dense Asbel and Pascal are about it.

I like the resolution of the Asbel/Sophie plot and I'm glad it's
not romantic. It's pretty adorable though.

--

Later in the morning I played for about two hours and got through
the confusing garden and fought the Little Queen. What a strange
character.

--

In the evening I played for about two hours and went through the
post-Little Queen sequence. I liked going around having Lambda
talk to everyone. The voice actor sounds like someone from Metal
Gear, but I can't place who.

I loved the skit with Pascal singing. It was so ridiculous.

I tried to do the Master Class Riot Peak trial, but died at
Poisson at the end... when she was almost dead and she was doing a
Mystic Arts. I'm not sure if I got the prizes, because there was
no mention of anything afterwards, unlike usual. I think I will
try again and go into Accel mode when she has a break.

of little breaks. I basically just did the last dungeon, but I
popped out once to do a few more requests and side quests.

I found it really interesting during the final moments of the game
to learn more about Lambda and how he was created and lived.

The side quest with the sick girl and the dolls was very cute and
had a nice twist in its ending. I also liked how one of the dolls
was the Prince from Katamari.

Two of my favourite skits so far were: when Asbel asks Pascal how
she got from the Amarcian Enclave to where the group was. Her
explanation was ridiculous. The other was when Pascal says that
Cheria is "chubbing out" and then her reaction to that comment.

I picked a fun set of costumes for my characters by the end of the
game: Sophie's pirate outfit, Cheria's new dress, Pascal's
swimsuit, Asbel's black outfit, and the two 'modern' outfits for
Malik and Hubert. I think they're all the best ones.

The last boss was very hard. I tried first on Chaos and got him to
half his health before running out of Elixirs and being
decimated. I next tried Evil and almost won but it was pretty
rough, so I decided when I tried again I'd do Hard. I did it that
time and got the Hard trophy (but not the Moderate
one... annoying.) A key I discovered was using the Hourglass
after his Mystic Artes had killed so many characters.

The ending was pretty intense and had a surprising resolution.

--

All together, it took my 68 hours and 18 minutes to get to the
"end" of the game. Of course, there's the Lineage &amp; Legacies
expansion, so I'm doing that too and will consider that to be the
actual end of the game.

It's pretty cool so far. My favourite skits have been the ones
about marriage. It's so cute that all of Asbel's proposals remind
him of Cheria and Cheria's crazy dream about their wedding day.

I don't yet understand the Accel system and I'm surprised that any
of the other characters would be able to use it given the story
explanation for its existence.

are players for so many different backgrounds.

I was very impressed and happy that Thor was actually still a

Astue after getting the attachment for the shuttle. I'm excited to
be able to use the Shuttle to go anywhere I want. When we were in
the military base, the block puzzles were a little bit annoying in
their opaqueness. The scene at the end with Pascal making things
was great ("Yaay for me!") and especially when she made rings and
Cheria said, "Are you and Malik engaged?" Very cute.

Later in the day, I played another three-ish hours. I got the
Shuttle fully under my control and went to do the swimsuit quest,
the turtlez headquarters, and the shuttle crash site. The crash
site was very interesting. The fight in the Cocoon against
Richard was very tough, but I did it on Evil difficulty. I used
so many Life Bottles that I only had one left for Emeraude, so I
had to drop the difficult down a bit (to Hard) to beat her. It
was so tough.

I made
it to the other planet, but haven't talked to anyone yet. I
thought the movie as the characters were launching to the other
planet was pretty awesome... particularly Fourier's army. I like
how much mystery there is around the other planet, the ring around
the planet the characters are from, etc. Although, I dislike how
little the characters seem to be reacting to the idea that there
is another planet, more people, etc.

It's been very tough to not have Sophie in the party. I've
decided to drop down the difficulty level to Evil, since no one
else can heal as effectively as she can. This is a little tough
for me, because (something I forgot to mention I liked yesterday)
the higher difficulties give you benefits. (As opposed to a game
like Persona, where the higher difficulty levels just punish you
and for you to grind more.)

Exploring the Snowshroud Ruins was a little ridiculous because all
the switches had the worst initial placement. It was almost absurd
how predictable it was that they'd be in the wrong place.

In Telos Astue, I noticed a typo in a skit subtitling: it said
"my" rather than "may" when Hubert was speaking.

--

I played for another almost two hours and explored through the
first dungeon on Fodra. I got Sophie's memories back, but they
weren't too exciting because I had already guessed most
everything. The biggest revelation was that Cornell really made
Lambda and there's something sinister about his creation and
Fodra.

--

After church, I played for an hour and got to Bathus Citadel. The
monsters on the way were tough because they could turn you to
stone and then kill you very quickly. Once I got used to
targeting them fast, it was much easier though.

Fendel Tower. After my experience on the mountain, I had enough
strength to totally cream most enemies today---including the Lab
boss on Chaos! I'm starting to run out of titles to acquire and
I'm starting to master old ones. I really enjoy the naming
convention on the Amarcians: Fermat, Pascal, Fourier, Gauss. :)

Later in the day, I played for another three hours and go to
before going to World's Eye. Although I'm a bit confused, because
I forgot there was a port in Zhavert... although I guess that's
how I got there? I had a very tough time with the enemies on
Chaos in the ice cave. I also decided to specifically try to get
my characters to use more attacks to gain Adept and Master titles
for them.

After my kids went to bed, I played for another hour and half. I
got to where the Shuttle is, but haven't taken the detour to
Lhant yet. I was very proud of my fight against Richard, because
I was able to beat him on Evil. (I got creamed on Chaos.) I
progressed the story a bit and went on the shipwreck side-quest
in Oul Raye, but died because of stupid Hubert. It's really
annoying to not have Sophie in my party, because she's an
essential part of my strategy and I've been using her the whole
time. This sequence of the game is a bit annoying in the amount
of running around you need to do. It feels like I spend more time
walking to a place than being there are fighting/learning about
the story.

After such a long day playing, I reflected a bit on the game. I
really like the story as an avenue for the characters to
interact. I think my favourite character is Pascal. They really
sell the way she acts and I like the way they don't have to have
pseudo-science explanations, because she just uses terms like
"thingamajigger" and such. It's cute.

I really enjoy the combat system. If I were playing on a
different difficulty level, I could imagine feeling it was boring
and rote, but because I have it at the maximum... it is pretty
stressful and requires a nice rhythm to it. I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable with it at the moment, because I'm trying to go
outside my comfort zone to get different titles for Asbel, but
it's still good. It's pretty awesome.

It's is practically without
dialogue for huge stretches and its setting is virtually without
compare. It feels incredibly realistic, although I don't really
have any way to verify that. I'm kind of amazed that it was made.

I think the most crazy part was when the lady is nearly drowning in
the pit and happens to give birth because the fall "shocked" her
into it. It was a little bit too crazy, but it worked in the story.

The movie was far more gory than it needed to be, but I think I
understand why Gibson designed it that way.

It's cool that at the core it is a "chase" movie.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2006/">2006</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry></feed>
