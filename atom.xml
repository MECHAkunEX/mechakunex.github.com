I
played on the highest difficulty allowed when you start. I'd like
to keep going, but I feel like it is really inconvenient, because
I don't want my kids to be around (because of all the violence and
language and butt rock in the game.) I think I will do it
though. The big question is whether I play old school games on the
down time or start my other PS3 game I have.

The final bosses were pretty interesting, although I found Vergil
to not be very difficult once you realized you had to beat him in
Devil mode. I also thought that Mundus wasn't that hard to dodge,
but he did so much damage you could only take a few hits before
going down, which made it feel harder. I think the fight against
the Mundus Spawn was very interesting though.

I was very curious how they were going to have Vergil turn on
you. Given that I've played the other games, I know he's supposed
to be the bad guy, so I was quite surprised at the beginning when
he was kind of your boss.

of a medieval fantasy shooter is very interesting and the "shop"

pretty cool. But once you get passed that, it's not that much more
interesting then any other old horizontal shooter.

each checkpoint, so basically infinite lives). It was pretty
brutal. In Hard, not only do you only start with One Life, but
everything kills you on one hit, so it's like playing a shmup and
doing a 1CC.

I found the general mechanics to be pretty much just okay. Not
terrible, but not spectacular either. However, the "set pieces"
and sequences in the game that were different we really cool. The
"puzzle rooms" in Stage 5 and the forced scrolling chase were
really neat. Stage 6, which was entirely in the shooter style, was
very fun too. It was awesome to take down the ship piece by piece.

It was also cool how even after fighting the final boss, you still
had to dodge and weave as it chased you to Earth. It was a good
tough.

In general, the graphics were some of the best I've seen on the
Genesis and I was genuinely impressed. 

Nevertheless, it feels like a one-off game that I couldn't get a
lot from another time.

Very fun! I
fought two new enemy types. The teleporting guy is tough!

Metropolis Zone. I pretty much feel the same about the game as I
did before. It's not that much better as you get deeper and, in
fact, some of the flaws... like the meandering through huge levels
aimlessly like a pinball... are exacerbated.

good. I found a lot of the acting a little "eh", but the world was
really cool. It's like a Sci-Fi version of the *REDACTED* doctrine that
Satan (and his followers) have no body, but want one, and can
possess humans and that their goal is for everyone to be "good" but
without the agency to decide to be good. A lot of what goes on in
the movie is clearly deeply inspired by this idea.

Some of the worst parts of the movie are classic Stephanie though:
for instance, the crazy love square with two people in one body,
which is at its craziest when Wanderer kisses two boys within
minutes.

There are some logical problems with the plot that I thought of,
or at least big questions:

- How do the Souls originally start the invasion? We see them enter
bodies by making an incision and then crawling in. It seems like
to start off, they would have to arrive not in "Soul" form but in
other bodies on traditional ships. Yet, we see them only travel
through space in their little Soul capsules.

- If it takes so long to travel between planets, as Wanderer says,
then how is it that there are Souls arriving periodically in the
first place. They would have had to have left long long before
the invasion of Earth started, confident that they would
eventually take it over, and given that the Souls do not appear
to be conscious during their capsule time, how would they steer
to the planet unless they knew already that it was inhabitable
and knew where the landing pad would be?

I like it when a book or movie leaves lots of interesting questions
about its universe. I'm interested in reading the book now.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2013/">2013</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Avenging Spirit (GB, 1992)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/08/07/Game--Avenging-Spirit--GB--1992--0.html" /><updated>2013-08-07T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/08/07/Game--Avenging-Spirit--GB--1992--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/08/07/Game--Avenging-Spirit--GB--1992--0.html">Game: Avenging Spirit (GB, 1992)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/08/">08</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/08/07/">07</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this for ten minutes and got to the third level. The
Kirby-like system of possessing enemies is very interesting and it
is clear that different enemies are better in different
situations. The platforming is really bad though. I feel like they
tried to compensate for the cramped screen with "floaty" jump
controls that give you much more leniency with where you will
land, but that this was an unwise choice and it is just
annoying. It has the annoying Ninja Gaiden-like enemy respawning
when you scroll their spawn points. Ouch. I can see how this game
is very interesting and worth thinking about, but it definitely
doesn't feel like a classic worth devoting a lot of attention to.

liked the style of the fight against the news guy... as he was
narrating the fight and talking to you. Very neat.
