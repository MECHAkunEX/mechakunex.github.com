I
got to the first town in Fendel. It's interesting how Fendel is
basically a cross between Russia and Germany.

I'm really enjoying all of Pascal's crazy dialogue; she's
actually funny. There was also a great skit with Sophie where she
thought she recognized peaches: once everyone was excited, she
said they reminded her of little butts. ;)

I've decided to go back through earlier parts of the game and
write down all my pending requests so I can keep an eye on them.

Along the way, I decided to complete the Arena---although I did
it only Easy. The last boss was really tough.

I spent about an hour on Stage 47 and didn't beat it.

Stage 46 --- This level was super tough to get the various pieces
of the timing down. The Napalm shooting tanks roughly half-way
through were the worst, then the Longai-O at the end was pretty
tough.

Stage 47 --- This level took a few tries to get to the end, but
now I can get to the end without even thinking. It's so
frustrating and unfair though, because I spend about three
minutes getting a chance at the final boss... who kills me in 5
seconds. It's ridiculous. I don't have any opportunity to even
practice and learn in a meaningful way. It almost makes me want
to not do it, it's so insulting. Ugh!

the benefits stop flowing. In this game, the turn-around time for

should always be doing it.

across the strange discussion of /The Invitation/, a 1960 ballet by
the Royal Ballet Touring Company that featured a re-enacted rape
scene on stage. There's a footnote about how ballet was technically
not under the purview of the censors. As an example:

"In August 1960, representatives from the Lord Chamberlin's
office attended a performance of /Les Ballets Africains/ to
determine if the production was ballet or theatre. If ballet,
bare breasts were permissible; if theatre, strictly
forbidden. The authorities agreed it was a ballet---and the
press had a field day with photos." (pg. 433)

Stage 43 --- I finally beat this after a few tries. I actually
beat it the first time I got to the Longai-O today. It was very
scary and I had to get up and walk around to get my heart to stop
racing.

Stage 44 --- I got to the end of this level on my first try today
and had just a few more hits needed on the Big Bot before it
died, but I wasn't quick enough staying behind its back and it
got me. I think I should have stopped, froze it, and hit it with
a Counter. I'll do that when I play again today.

--

Later in the day I played for another forty-ish minutes.

Stage 44 --- I beat this after a few more tries. The first time I
got to the Big Bot I got him, but it took a while to get there
because I was a bit sloppy.

Stage 45 --- This level took a long time to do. Eventually I
settled on a single Dash to double Freeze to Counter attack. It
was very subtle to get right, but I did it.

I think there's just 47 Stages in the Fury mode. Almost there!

Part of me feels like the game requires you to understand
something about golf... because it doesn't give you any assistance
understanding what will happen because of the wind, ground
curvature, or grass length, etc---but requires you to figure it
out. I don't find that my intuition for that stuff is growing.

Nevertheless, I definitely have fond memories of playing the game
and I think that it is very well made, so I think deserves a high
ranking.

awesome. Being on the Evil difficult got really brutal once I was
inside too and I needed to switch my strategy around to have
Cheria and Sophie constantly healing.

Later in the day, I played for another hour or so and finished
the Rockgagong dungeon. The boss was very tough on Evil,
particularly when there were lots of parasites. I think I used 4
Life Bottles in a row when they first appeared before I thinned
the crowd a bit.

Exploring Yu *REDACTED*erte was fun and the conversation with the

the part at all though.

"Evil" difficulty level. I also decided to start investing more
in the using the Shards, which I have heretofore ignored. I
basically did nothing to advance the story, except explore the
next town a tiny bit. Most of the time when I turn the game on, I
like to let the opening movie play because I like the music so
much. =)

I was very excited
by the development of Richard's punkish character and how
Sophie's memories were returned. I think Cheria's progression is
really adorable and I'm excited to see what happens.

Mechanically, I feel like the battles are getting a lot harder
and I'm trying to use the cooking system in a more complex way
too. I'm beginning to really understand the combo system and how
to get good strings out of it.

again tonight and try to do both.

lot. I think I can tell what is happening... Richard much be
possessed by the demon from the beginning. The combat is still
good. I'm spending most of the time in Hard mode, but if I die
against a mob, I grind and if I die against a boss, I drop to
Moderate for the fight. I want to unlock the harder difficulties.

--

Later in the day, I played a bit more and got Richard his kingdom
back. In the fight against Victoria, I did it on Hard, but Asbel
died at the last second of the battle and I couldn't heal him (it
was like... frames apart) and so he didn't get any experience! I
was tempted to restart it but decided not to. I had to fight
Cedric many times and eventually dropped it to Normal rather than
grinding. I felt a little dirty.

I really like the Cooking system. It's very cute and I like how
it works mechanically.

Evil movies. The setup is crazy, absurd, and retcons everything of
the past ones... for example, apparently every star of the past
movies is a clone! (This is to be able to have tons of cameos.) My
favourite part of the clone thing is when Becky says to Michelle
Rodriguez #3 that she met "her sister (and she wasn't very
nice)". Hah!

It's brilliant and so dumb that they were able to create a video
game-style "level" setup with the various test sites. Strangely,
it is so reminiscent of the first one, it's one of the best. I
think Alice's care for Becky is sweet.

The final sequence is insane and Wesker is ridiculous and annoying
as usual. I wonder what will happen next?

This review blurb is great: ``Clark Collis from Entertainment
Weekly also gave the film a mostly positive review, stating that
"writer-director W.S. Anderson's overseeing of the Resident Evil
zombie franchise has proven to be both lunatically haphazard and
dementedly enthusiastic."''</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry></feed>
