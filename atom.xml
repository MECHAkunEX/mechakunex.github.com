    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game sooo much when I was a kid. I enjoyed
beat-em-ups and this one in particular to play with friends.</p>

<p>I played tonight for the whole first level and then died on the
boss. It was incredibly rote and there weren&#8217;t even exciting
graphics or satisfying punching like in Streets of Rage. I feel
like this genre of game is so easy to replace with better
versions that put all the old ones to shame.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/12/23/Game&#8211;Target-Earth&#8211;GEN&#8211;1990&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game in two chunks today. I saw the Encyclopedia
Bombastica entry about it and thought it looked neat.</p>

<p>In my first chunk, I played for about an hour and got to
stage 4. I played the first stage maybe ten times before I was
able to do anything. The game has a steep learning curve in terms
of controlling your mecha and understanding how weak the mecha
is. The key seems to be going very slowly, so that you can
recharge. I feel like it is reminiscent, in a way, to a game like
Vanquish, where it is essential to stay with your squad.</p>

<p>In my second chunk, I played for a bit more than an hour and beat
it. The story was mildly interesting and the final levels seemed
easier because you had more stuff, but still challenging.</p>

<p>I think the hardest level was the first low-gravity one where you
had to defend the ships and then get into one of them by the
end. I couldn&#8217;t guard them effectively, but I realized that if I
kept one off-screen, I could continually dodge and then get into
at the last second without it being destroyed.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the game once I got into it. The chunky feel of
the game felt purposeful and interesting. The aiming system that
encouraged you to stay still was neat. The progression system was
a nice touch.</p>

<p>I think my only really problem was that most of the weapons had
such limited ammo, that I conserved them to the point of never
using them. I used the spread shot a few times in the
beginning. I used the grenade launcher once. Once I got the
missile pods, I used them to defeat the last few bosses. I think
the game could have been better by having a different special
weapon system. For example, you could decide between different
shapes and then the other weapons would be power-ups that you&#8217;d
have to find in the level and they might be permanent after that,
or have a time-limit (so you are compelled to blast with them.)
Or, they could have made it so it was essential to use them, so
you had to figure out to use them properly. As it was, they felt
so valuable that I never experimented with them enough to learn
how they worked.</p>

<p>Another thing that could have been better was providing another
way to deal with enemies that were incredibly close to you. There
were many times when I was just covered and enemies and couldn&#8217;t
do anything because the bullets appeared on the screen passed the
mob. Perhaps a melee weapon would have been the trick?</p>

<p>In any case, this was a very fun game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for maybe 10 rounds. Each time I could barely
register a few hits on the target. It&#8217;s an incredibly bizarre
game. It&#8217;s kind of a 2D platforming action game, but with an
incredibly small arena and horrific controls. Definitely not a
winner.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game until the boss of the third stage. I used one
continue on the first stage getting to know the systems; I used
another at the beginning of stage two and stage three; then I got
to the boss of stage three and died. Stage three was incredibly
painful on the eyes because the background scroll so much.</p>

<p>The game was a very competent shooter from that era, with the
standard complaints for someone that loves CAVE. The idea that you
are person is kind of cute and the rotating options are neat
too. But, the game doesn&#8217;t have enough distinctive to feel
special.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about 30 minutes. It took me 5 minutes to
get passed level 1, then I spent the rest of the time in the next
level. I got no keys at all and could barely make any progress.</p>

<p>This game is so brutal. Nemo can&#8217;t really jump over enemies, even
if he has stunned them with candy. Most of the animals have no
ability to hurt the enemies. It&#8217;s so hard but you have no ways to
deal with it. It&#8217;s not fun, despite the concept being great and
the general premise of turning into lots of different animals
sounds like it would be great. But, it doesn&#8217;t follow through
enough.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this and got to Area 5 on one continue. (There are 8
levels.) My score was 1,997,270 points. This is one of those old
shmups (I think of them as of the &#8220;Solider&#8221; archetype) where if
you die then you are totally screwed because you lose all your
power-ups. In this round, but Area 3, I had literally everything
you could get (there&#8217;s a store to buy stuff and it tells you when
there isn&#8217;t anything to get), and was stomping on everything. But
then I lost it at the end of Area 4, then spammed bombs on the
boss and then spent a few continues trying and failing to get
past Area 5.</p>

<p>There were a lot of cute graphics&#8230; really weird stuff but not
&#8220;cute&#8221; like Parodius, more just bizarre. That was fun to look at,
but the mechanics weren&#8217;t worth trying again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for about 45 minutes. I&#8217;d never really played it
before and I just assumed it was exactly the same as Tetris. But
it&#8217;s much more complex and incredibly challenging.</p>

<p>I got to Level 8 with a score of 30,600.</p>

<p>During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense
pressure. The game board is so claustrophobic and you feel like
no decision is the right one. It&#8217;s so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.</p>

<p>My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She&#8217;s amazing!</p>

the giant sprites do the gameplay a great dis-service by
preventing you from seeing enough of the screen to do anything
really effectively. I did not enjoy it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through this on Easy as Blaze and got to the final
boss. The combat feels pretty good in this game, but it has the
normal problems with beat-em-ups: the bosses are impossible unless
you use lots of special attacks, which are drastically
limited. I&#8217;m surprised I got so far. On my first continue, I got
to the end of Round 5. On my second, I got to the end of
Round 7. In the third, I got to the final boss. Definitely not
worth playing again, but it wasn&#8217;t a terrible waste of an hour.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never played this puzzle game before. There&#8217;s nothing too
wrong with it as a concept, but I find it very difficult to enjoy
puzzle games like this for a long time. They would really be best
as rotating little games in a larger context. This particular
version of the Columns concept, however, feels really broken.</p>

<p>As you get jewels, it gets faster and faster. It gets so fast that
you can&#8217;t think at all and the best you can do it plan one move
ahead and then rotate the blocks as they&#8217;ve just landed to make
the most of the situation. It actually feels like you&#8217;re not
really making decisions and are winning randomly.</p>

<p>I was able to make it 22 levels and there were many times I
basically gave up but randomly got triples that totally changed
my luck. Weird.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played another five matches in the middle of the day over about
an hour. I discovered a new trick: after expending all your super
kicks (or just getting an advantage), run down the clock so you
win. I found two good ways to run down the clock: First, knock out
a member of the other team and go into the zone that only he
defends and wait. Second, continually to head-butt passes (the AI
never intercepts these). Hah!</p>

<p>At the end of the day I played again for another hour or so and
beat the game. The final few matches were really tough to keep the
ball on my side and I got scored on more than any other matches,
but I was able to win with a bit of abuse. It&#8217;s a fun game to play
and I can imagine it being more difficult and interesting.</p>

really tough to fight himself.</p>

<p>At night, I went through the rest of the game and beat it. I
found this game to be much much harder than the other ones. I
think one thing that made it so difficult was that when you died
against a boss in the Wily stages, you had to do the end of the
level again. The 2nd form of the Wily Machine was really
brutal. It took me so long to even be able to hit him at all. I
watched a few YouTube videos and still couldn&#8217;t do it. I think it
took about 45 minutes of fighting over and over again.</p>

minutes. I&#8217;ve heard about this game many times before and I had
much greater expectations about how crazy and silly it would
be. I thought the bosses I fought were very cool, but overall, it
wasn&#8217;t too crazy.</p>

<p>The mechanics are very reasonable for its time&#8230; it&#8217;s just
Gradius. My only problem with it is that the NES is not a good
system for it: it has really atrocious and not intentional
slow-down; the sprite flicker is really bad and makes it hard to
see enemy bullets; and, the game lacks the vibrancy that it seems
like it should have. I&#8217;m also quite spoiler by CAVE when it comes
to being able to distinguish enemy bullets from mine and seeing
the hit box of the character easily.</p>

<p>I will try the other Parodius games rather than invest any more
time in this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These TECHNOS games feel so good. I like the dynamics in this
game and the way it feels great to tackle your opponent. I really
enjoy more abstract sports games like this. I don&#8217;t know if I
wouldn&#8217;t like the more modern, realistic sports games&#8230; I
presume I wouldn&#8217;t, but I haven&#8217;t really played them. One thing
about this game though, is that I don&#8217;t think it could sustain
playing it for a long sitting. I played for a little more than
thirty minutes and that seems like the right amount of time. I
think I will keep at it and beat it&#8230; maybe?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played the first, second, and third levels over about an
hour. I didn&#8217;t finish the last level.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the game. It is extremely similar to Advance Wars. I
find the interface in Advance Wars to be superior and the game is
more complex, but not in a way that is extremely complex. Both
are very simple, but they allow that simplicity to be used to
create interesting and challenging situations. But, because of
the similarity, I don&#8217;t feel a great compulsion to play this
game, particularly when it is so inconvenient to do so. (I have a
Japanese PC Engine, so my Hu-Card doesn&#8217;t work, so I have to
emulate it.)</p>

<p>Maybe if I got deeper into the game, there would be something
unlike about it that would be worth understanding, but after
scanning a FAQ, it doesn&#8217;t seem so.</p>

<p>I would really like a procedurally generated game like this where
I could play at incredibly small chunks overtime. Until then&#8230; I
think I&#8217;ll abandon it.</p>
