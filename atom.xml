I've heard a lot
about the game and I watched the GC-CX episode about it, so I
knew what I was getting into, but I really didn't understand well
enough what it would really be like.

The game is really strange. The sim part is very basic and takes
a lot more of your time. It's not totally trivial, because you
have to manage the enemies while you are building. The combat
part is also really basic and quite a bit awkward in the control
department---the sprites feel too big and clunky. The boss
battles are basically "stand and slog" while spamming magic. It's
a bit disappointing actually.

In general, the whole game is easy in a strange way, but also
very compelling. I am almost done with the island city, then I'll
have it's final combat stage, the next city (two combat stages),
and then presumably a boss fight/final stage. I think I'll be
able to beat it about another hour, so I'll finish it.

I
found it to be easier than past Mega Man games in general and /a
lot/ easier than Mega Man 5.

I think the "problem" was that the Rush Jet is so powerful for
cheesing through areas. Similarly, Beat is really useful for
avoiding enemies in platforming sequences. Putting these things
together eliminated a lot of the challenges. 

This would normally leave the bosses as the main attraction, but
unfortunately the majority of them could be killed by standing in
front of them and shooting. You rarely ran out of the weakness
weapon before they died.

One of the hardest parts was the first Wily stage where there was
a long vertical drop of spikes where sometimes you needed to take
a leap of faith and then use the Rush Jet to catch yourself just
before hitting the spikes. It was pretty intense and took a lot
of tries.

It was definitely a *fun* Mega Man game, but I wouldn't say it was
as good, because I didn't feel super awesome after beating it.

I got to the boss of the third
level and used one continue in the process. I found the game to
be really interesting... the variety of power-ups is pretty
absurd and the cuteness of the game is off the hook. I found the
mechanics to be passable, but not lovable. 

The biggest pain in the mechanics was that it was to easy to
accidentally take a puff and launch into the air rather than just
do a normal jump and then when you accidentally got a power-up, it
was hard to get rid of it. It felt like it really needed a SNES
controller to have a distinct button for some of these things, or
if you could fly by doing a double jump or something. Finally, it
felt like there was a lot of lag in the controls, which normally
didn't matter, but was pretty horrible on the boss fights.

I just ran through the majority of the stages and only had to
think during the boss fights. The boss fights were solved by
either getting the perfect power-up right before or memorizing
the sequence of actions.

This is one of those games that I can see the beauty of at the
time, but similar games have such better systems, that it isn't
worth getting into. It has definitely convinced me to try future
Kirby games though.

and about the actual protection of our country, rather than taking
over other countries. I thought this movie did that really well.

Obviously the movie is fantasy, but I felt like they built a good
explanation of how the kids learned their skills and used their
tactics. The only place where their guerrilla tactics aren't used
is the siege on the police station, which is a bit too
"action-hero-y" to fit.

I liked the ending and that what happens to the hero plays against
tropes. I thought the final scene was pretty awesome too. My only
complaint was that they don't sell Matt's growth as a character
well enough... it seems out of nowhere and a bit unbelievable.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Mega Man 5 (NES, 1992) (3)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/04/02/Game--Mega-Man-5--NES--1992--2.html" /><updated>2013-04-02T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/04/02/Game--Mega-Man-5--NES--1992--2.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/04/02/Game--Mega-Man-5--NES--1992--2.html">Game: Mega Man 5 (NES, 1992) (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/04/">04</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/04/02/">02</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played today for about two hours and beat this.

didn't get Beat. Bummer. There were a few super frustrating
moments... like the crystal dispensers in Crystal Man's stage and
a few of the long moving conveyor belt areas. It took me a long
time to get through the Wily Fortress 1 Crusher segment because I
didn't realized I needed to double slide. I tried to run and then
slide. The end of the game was intense with the double castles.

*This* is an NES game!

I did Star Man, then Gravity Man,
then Gyro Man.

Star Man's stage was pretty vanilla. It was funny that space =
underwater in the Mega-Man-iverse. The last checkpoint was really
brutal. Once I died right at the boss door from a stupid jump.

Gravity Man's stage was fairly easy, but his boss fight was
insanely hard. I could barely get any hits in. You had to use the
Star attack and be really careful. I hate it when in Mega Man boss
fights you almost can't win unless you have the weakness weapon.

Gyro Man's level was a good difficulty. I found the spike elevator
to be challenging, because I thought you needed to wait and slide,
but then I realized you needed to plan an early jump as the
platform was coming at you. The boss fight was really easy with
the gravity hold.

Lately, since I've been playing so many different NES games and
most of them aren't that impressive, I've been thinking to myself
that maybe the NES isn't as amazing as I remember. But then I play
a game like this that is really amazing and I remember why I love
it so much. It's just a matter of finding the right games.

I did the Overseer
ship but the very next mission was really hard to do and I've
restarted it three or four times. There are two Sectopods right
away and it's very hard to get organized enough to take them
out. I bought an Alloy SHIV, but it doesn't seem to be very
reliable, since it can't take cover.

In the evening I played for about three hours and I beat the
game. I did one short mission (against a downed battleship, which
gave me a LOT of materials) and then I skipped missions until the
Gollop Chamber was made and I could go to the ending.

The final mission was pretty challenging, especially against the
Sectopods and the Mutons. The dialogue was pretty interesting,
although the whole game was incredibly anti-climatic. The final
room was trivial: I walked it with one character, she shot the
boss, then my sniper was in range and got a head-shot and killed
him. None of the enemies had any chance to react, so I didn't see
their powers in anyway. Some of the earlier fights were pretty
easy too, because the Rift attack is so powerful. (But they were
challenging to set up.) The resolution of the story was pretty
terrible too (not that I care too much about it... but they seemed
to)---the voice work was /so/ bad and they tried to express
emotion with these flat character models. The worst part though
was that they didn't resolve the interesting dialogue about the
purpose of the aliens at all.

Overall, I found the game to be really fun. Most of my complaints
are about the interface. I feel like you converge incredibly
quickly to knowing what the right strategy is and then the rest
of game is dealing with the fog of war and dealing with failed
shots because of random chance. Looking at it like that, it
doesn't feel very fun. And I think that's why I don't feel like I
want to play again right away. But I do like the mechanics so I
intend to play it again at some point, just not now.

I like the way they stick to the
"found footage" concept and explain the good camera work in many
scenes by the telekinetic powers. I thought the ending, where they
jump from all sorts of different cameras was cool.

I really like the way it is a very naturalistic and realistic
depiction of how super-heroes (and villains) would be created. I
like the way the evil in the movie is so real and not cartoony.

I feel like the movie leaves open all sorts of mundane questions,
like how does Matt's girlfriend feel about her experience? What did
the people in Seattle say about what happened? Etc. The thing
that's cool about these questions is that because they are mundane,
they mean that the movie was able to make me care about the normal
feelings of people in the background, etc. It's neat.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: XCOM: Enemy Unknown (PS3, 2012) (4)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html" /><updated>2013-03-29T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html">Game: XCOM: Enemy Unknown (PS3, 2012) (4)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/29/">29</a></span></span><pre class="content">I've continued playing.

to get the Firestorms ready to shoot down the Overseer ship. I
just shot it down and am getting ready to go in.

I'm still really strapped for items, but I'm starting to buy up
everything. One of my big questions right now is whether I should
use the Ghost Armor and whether I should spend money to get a
SHIV, and if so, which one.

I did a lot of missions
trying to get the resources to get to the next level of the
game---building a ship and taking down the Overseer ship. I
started to have really bad injuries after most battles, forcing me
to expand my stable of troops.

I'm finding the combat to be very same-y: I know what I need to
do, almost algorithmically, and when it fails, it's almost always
because of the random number generator. Since you can't change the
outcomes by save scumming, you have to just reload and try
something slightly different (sometimes just doing the actions in
a different order) and you'll get the result you want. I feel like
as the game is progressing, the enemies are increasing in strength
at the same rate I am, so the difficulty has plateaued and there's
no new strategy to learn.

In the meta-game of managing the base, I feel so tightly
constrained by a lack of materials, there's almost nothing to
actually do. I spent some time making it so I could have tons of
satellites in the air. (In fact, in 10 days of game time, I will
have a satellite in every country.) One side-effect of that is
that I now have a ridiculous amount of money. Unfortunately it
doesn't really matter because I don't have enough Alloy, etc to
actually build anything. It makes me wish there were a way to buy
Alloy or purposefully go on a mission that would net you some.

I definitely still like the game and see a lot of good in it, but
as I continue to play, I am getting less and less enamored with
it and see more of its flaws.

The most glaring flaw is the horrible UI for modifying your troops
load outs. There's no easy way to make sure you are sending your
guys out with your best stuff. You need to manually go to every
other character that you aren't going to use and make sure to
de-equip them with everything. The game really needed to just show
you everything that was available in the menu and have it get
de-equipped when you selected it if it was in use, with perhaps
the constraint that you couldn't de-equip from people in the
active squad. That would do wonders for the experience of playing
the game.

also lost my first character. He got hit and was bleeding out,
but my medic was panicked, so I couldn't get to him in time. The
rest of the mission went so well, that I decided to let him
die. It was sad, because he was so high level.

I'm continuing to be nervous about having done the wrong thing
and, in particular, that I won't have enough fighter jets to deal
with the threats.

verge of having to give up and do it again with more
knowledge. This fear is pretty unfounded, but it's still there.

I also have no clue how far along in the game I'm doing, I'm
currently waiting to go to the Alien Base.
