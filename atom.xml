this causes him to actually realize that they should be

it didn't come up before. I wonder if Goku is actually vulnerable
in his tail, or if he just doesn't like it being touched.

Watching Dragon Ball each morning makes me feel like I'm in
elementary school again. When I was young, I would watch it each
morning while eating breakfast before going out to the bus.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Dragon Ball/">Dragon Ball</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Bloodborne (PS4, 2015) (3)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2015/08/24/Game--Bloodborne--PS4--2015--2.html"/><updated>2015-08-24T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2015/08/24/Game--Bloodborne--PS4--2015--2.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2015/08/24/Game--Bloodborne--PS4--2015--2.html">Game: Bloodborne (PS4, 2015) (3)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2015/">2015</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2015/08/">08</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2015/08/24/">24</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played for a while and beat Father Gascione.

I went with a Military Veteran
with the Pistol and the Axe.

It took me a long time to get used to the combat. The first area
of the street is really brutal with all the different enemies
wandering around. I walked slowly and was grabbed by the Wolves. I
went back (by sprinting) and got my Blood Echoes, then ran back
and went through the Kennels until I unlocked the shortcut. (I
love, by the way, that enemies take your Blood Echoes if they are
hunters. At first I didn't get it and was annoyed, but then I
realized it was great.) 

I tried to fight the Cleric Beast a few times, but failed and gave
up. I lost 6k souls from that, which hurt, but it was annoying
because I couldn't do anything with them anyways, since the fight
is what got me access to upgrading my level.

The game is pretty great. I was so nervous walking around with a
ton of Blood Echoes and not knowing the area. My wife came by and
I said, "My heart is pounding! This game is terrifying!"

I finished the
campaign and decided to put the game down. I did not get 100%
though. Here are the things that I had left to do:

- 2 Shangri-La missions: I probably would have done them had they
been available during the first part of the game, but I felt I
had been playing too long when I got to the North and I didn't
really love the unique combat there. It was often very
"frontal", as opposed to my preferred way of steal thing when
fighting in the normal game.

- 2 Longinus missions: I never really liked the Himalayas
missions, for the same reason as the Shangri-La, but the blood
diamond ones were fun.

- 1 skill: I never did the Arena, so I never unlocked its skill
and upgraded it, although by the time I ended the game, I had 10
Skill points waiting to be assigned. I basically never used the
Syringes anyways.

- 5 weapons: There were 5 weapons that I never got, some related
to the things mentioned above. Since I didn't really have any
more missions to do, I wasn't stress about getting them just for
the sake of having them.

- Lots of quests: Given that I did one of each, and they were all
the same but in a different area, I wasn't crazy about doing
them all. I can see if I were younger and had more time than
games, I would definitely do them all.

- Lots of collectibles: I wasn't going to go and tear down every
poster, but I tore down all the ones I went near during the
normal course of things. I think I would have gotten more
collectibles had I flown in the Buzzer less.

I ended up with 67.15% completion and there were no interesting
trophies that were not collected. I sided with Amita the whole
time during the missions, although I felt near the end they were
both pretty dumb. I didn't kill anyone (Sabal or Pagan) and just
let them go. I think the character I played would have killed
Amita and taken over the country. I think the best thing for the
world of the game would have been to do the secret ending where
you just wait for Pagan to come back in the beginning.

I really enjoyed taking over the Outposts and Fortresses. That was
easily the funnest part of the game, because you had to scope them
out and decide how you were going to do it and it was pretty
free. The Propaganda Centers were similarly fun. I really enjoyed
the feeling of shooting a helicopter out of the sky and sniping
from an extreme distance without being detected.

Overall I was very satisfied with the game, but I can't imagine
playing another game like it any time soon, because I already feel
a bit burned out on what kind of activity it had me do.

used the grenade launcher a lot in my escape, which was pretty
silly. I did the heroin lab one, which was really cleverly done. I
bought all the weapons that I had unlocked because I had such a
huge surplus of money and very little to spend it on.

cool. I liked the moment of getting out of the water and doing a
takedown on the guy at the edge. Escaping the temple was pretty
fun too.

I did a bomb defusing quest, mainly to unlock another skill.

Then, I hunted some Sambar so I could craft another thing.

Next, I intend to do a Longinus quest so I can unlock the
reloading skill, then I'll get back on the campaign trail.

First, I did some
hunting of leopards to get their skin to finance getting the
garden built at the Homestead. Then, I gathered plants to sell and
made a lot of money so that I could buy the Predator sniper rifle
and finish the Homestead. I was annoyed that nothing seemed to
really happy when I did and the Shrine wasn't even cool, it's just
a dopey source of a little money.

After that, I flew the Buzzer around and destroyed all the Pagan's
Wrath convoys from the air with grenades. I didn't realize that
they wouldn't just go away before, so I wanted them to be clear
while I explore the area. As I did that, I stopped at lots of
Unknown Locations to pick up their stuff and explore.

Once I did that, I did two Campaign missions to defend the
Monastery and then go to the Himalayas. When I was in the
Himalayas, I gathered all the Snow Leopard skins I need. Now, I
just need to get some Sambar skins and then I'm all set until I
unlock more Fashion Week events in the North. I think that I will
basically just be working on Campaign missions for a while.
