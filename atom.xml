First, I did
the tutorial then stages 1, 2, and 3. Later in the day, I did
stages 4, 5, 6, and 7.

I've tried to play a Bangai-O game before (the DS one), but I
didn't give it enough of a chance to convince me (so I don't have
a reasonable opinion of it); but, in any case, I was a bit nervous
about this. Given that I spent some money on though, I figured it
would be a nice way to force me to understand it... given that
I've heard so many good things about the Bangai games before, and
I love Treasure.

This game is insanely overwhelming, visually and
mechanically. There's a 29-page in-game manual, which frightened
me away from reading it. Then in front of each of level is an
overwhelming set of advice, which I haven't yet been able to
understand deeply enough to apply.

The first few levels were very fun and challenging. The next set
escalated the difficulty a lot---particularly the level where you
fought Longai-O and the Ant level.

When I play the game, I immediately feel a sense of time dilation,
where everything seems to be going really slow and I can focus on
little things on a purely intuitive basis. Even though a level may
only last two minutes, it feels like it lasts a lot longer because
of the number of decisions I'm making. Yet, at the same time, I
feel like I'm not really making conscious choices, but am just
reacting at a reptilian level to what's going on. It's bizarre.

I tried to explain the game to my wife a bit, who was overwhelmed
as I expected, but she was able to appreciate my replay of the Ant
level. Moreover, she was able to immediately see the amazing skill
of the number one in world (for time) on that same level.

I get the feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun with this game!

In the
last part of the game, I stopped balancing my classes and just
focused on a strategy that I knew could win. My strategy was so
effective, I was able to defeat the final boss in a single hit
after a few rounds of preparation.

Overall, I found the game okay. The combat was too easy, but a
little bit stressful to not be totally boring. (I never died
during the whole game.) The writing was very funny in the
beginning, but got increasingly crazy and out-of-whack. I like
the weirdness, but I didn't really like it when it was trying to
be "dark" or "edgy".

I tried to do the Prologue, but (a) I was annoyed that I had to
go back to level 1, (b) I didn't know anything about the previous
games, and (c) the non-sense story had gotten on my nerves.

The game is definitely worth the price!

to be able to spend it without worrying too much about what I am
saving for, etc. I decided to order a game on Amazon and then
download one to play right away. I'd heard an interview about
this game and it sounded very cute.

I played for two chunks of an hour and a half. Right away the
writing was hilarious and made me want to read every little thing
and look at the text on all the monsters.

When I started playing, I like the 16-bit art-style the game has
and the mechanics are pretty nice. The movement feels a bit
sloppy with the Xbox's analog stick, though.

The game is incredibly streamlined, despite its style. I was very
surprised with the graph-based overworld rather than a map that
you actually walk around on. It makes the linearity of the story
very much in your face. Now, that linearity is not terrible, given
how much I liked games like Final Fantasy that just have the
illusion of options. But, in this there really can't be any
options because no paths can be hidden from you. It's a bit
underwhelming, even though it is nice to not have to walk.

The lack of random battles was surprising as well and it appears
that there are simply a fixed number of battles in the game,
because when you leave an area then go back, all the enemies you
defeated are still gone. It's kind of surprising and it makes me
nervous as a grinding/completion-ist oriented person.

The battle system itself is pretty neat. The idea that you store
up MP per round and then unleash it all at once places something
that it is a fairly common, but rarely used, mechanic in other
games (like Tension in Dragon Quest or Cyan's Special Attack in
FF6) as the defining thing. At least you don't give up your turn
and can still attack or use a 0 MP spell. Nevertheless, I almost
always use 1 or 2 MP spells.

Similarly, the item system is really odd. Items are like the
skills in FF13: they can only effectively be used a finite number
of times per battle. But, they can be used every battle without
effort and they are improved via a technology-research-like
system. It's odd.

I like the way the battle order is resolved... how you have to
decide your moves slightly in advance of what other characters
will do. It's just enough active to be interesting.

I think it is odd that you always know how much HP the enemies
have. It seems wrong to have so much information.

As interesting as the system is, I've never lost a battle or felt
very worried about any particular outcome. The battles are
definitely interesting, but I can generally ace them. I hope they
stretch me a bit more eventually.

Given how quickly you lose a party member, it makes me extremely
nervous about giving resources (particularly buying weapons for)
the non-main characters. I wish they would telegraph a little
more that a character will be permanent. (I've decided that if
they have all four weapon upgrades, they must be.)

The class system is very funny, but I haven't found a lot of use
for the various classes. There are few that I find myself really
using---like healing ones, but generally I ignore them except to
level them evenly. I think it is funny that Tycho can be a
Gentleman AND a Scholar.

I quite like the game and will continue playing it, of course.

During the whole game, I felt like I was under intense

no decision is the right one. It's so stressful, but a lot of fun
and very satisfying.

My wife came in to watch me play and was very curious. She played
for a bit and after the 3rd level felt the dread it inspired a
lot. She did some really creative things though. She's amazing!

there isn't anything to get), and was stomping on everything. But
then I lost it at the end of Area 4, then spammed bombs on the

past Area 5.

There were a lot of cute graphics... really weird stuff but not
"cute" like Parodius, more just bizarre. That was fun to look at,
but the mechanics weren't worth trying again.

This game is so brutal. Nemo can't really jump over enemies, even
if he has stunned them with candy. Most of the animals have no
ability to hurt the enemies. It's so hard but you have no ways to

the general premise of turning into lots of different animals
sounds like it would be great. But, it doesn't follow through
enough.

In my first chunk, I played for about an hour and got to
stage 4. I played the first stage maybe ten times before I was
able to do anything. The game has a steep learning curve in terms
of controlling your mecha and understanding how weak the mecha
is. The key seems to be going very slowly, so that you can
recharge. I feel like it is reminiscent, in a way, to a game like
Vanquish, where it is essential to stay with your squad.

In my second chunk, I played for a bit more than an hour and beat
it. The story was mildly interesting and the final levels seemed
easier because you had more stuff, but still challenging.

I think the hardest level was the first low-gravity one where you
had to defend the ships and then get into one of them by the
end. I couldn't guard them effectively, but I realized that if I
kept one off-screen, I could continually dodge and then get into
at the last second without it being destroyed.

I really enjoyed the game once I got into it. The chunky feel of
the game felt purposeful and interesting. The aiming system that
encouraged you to stay still was neat. The progression system was
a nice touch.

I think my only really problem was that most of the weapons had
such limited ammo, that I conserved them to the point of never
using them. I used the spread shot a few times in the
beginning. I used the grenade launcher once. Once I got the
missile pods, I used them to defeat the last few bosses. I think
the game could have been better by having a different special
weapon system. For example, you could decide between different
shapes and then the other weapons would be power-ups that you'd
have to find in the level and they might be permanent after that,
or have a time-limit (so you are compelled to blast with them.)
Or, they could have made it so it was essential to use them, so
you had to figure out to use them properly. As it was, they felt
so valuable that I never experimented with them enough to learn
how they worked.

Another thing that could have been better was providing another
way to deal with enemies that were incredibly close to you. There
were many times when I was just covered and enemies and couldn't
do anything because the bullets appeared on the screen passed the
mob. Perhaps a melee weapon would have been the trick?

In any case, this was a very fun game.

beat-em-ups and this one in particular to play with friends.

I played tonight for the whole first level and then died on the
boss. It was incredibly rote and there weren't even exciting
graphics or satisfying punching like in Streets of Rage. I feel
like this genre of game is so easy to replace with better
versions that put all the old ones to shame.

There's nothing too
wrong with it as a concept, but I find it very difficult to enjoy
puzzle games like this for a long time. They would really be best
as rotating little games in a larger context. This particular
version of the Columns concept, however, feels really broken.

As you get jewels, it gets faster and faster. It gets so fast that
you can't think at all and the best you can do it plan one move
ahead and then rotate the blocks as they've just landed to make
the most of the situation. It actually feels like you're not
really making decisions and are winning randomly.

I was able to make it 22 levels and there were many times I
basically gave up but randomly got triples that totally changed
my luck. Weird.
