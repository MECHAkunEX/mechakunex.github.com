    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for a little less than four hours. I went from the
Duke&#8217;s Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good&#8230; still hard because you&#8217;ve got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up&#8230;
it&#8217;s all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow&#8230; just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.</p>

<p>I &#8220;love&#8221; seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.</p>

<p>I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there&#8217;s no doubt about
that, but I&#8217;m not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/06/27/Book&#8211;Catching-Fire&#8211;by-Suzanne-Collins&#8211;2009&#8211;0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.</p>

<p>The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It&#8217;s as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn&#8217;t possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.</p>

<p>I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>I teared up in the District 11 scene.</p>

<p>Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?</p>

<p>It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.</p>

<p>Haymitch&#8217;s story is great.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;food porn&#8221; in the books never gets old, strangely.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; private session with the Gamemakers :)</p>

<p>The pre-Games interviews were amazing.</p>

<p>The end of Part II is waaaay intense.</p>

<p>I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss&#8217; body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s &#8220;naked&#8221; or talk about
her &#8220;breasts&#8221; and most often she mentions her &#8220;underwear&#8221;,
&#8220;underclothes&#8221;, or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;. It&#8217;s particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we&#8217;re so often given.</p>

<p>The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for about two hours and beat the Four Kings (on my
first try! with only 5 healing potions! boom!) and then spent a
lot of money upgrading my shields to +10 and buying Green Shards
to begin upgrading my bow and my next sword. I got myself over to
the Duke&#8217;s Archives for the next part of the game, but I won&#8217;t
play much longer tonight, despite having the time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m disappointed the movie didn&#8217;t use the plot-point about the
&#8220;traitor&#8221; that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It&#8217;s a cool
idea.</p>

<p>I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine the audience really being excited about
it.</p>

<p>Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It&#8217;s very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn&#8217;t as touching.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting movie. I think I preferred King of Kong,
however. Something I disliked about the guys in the movie is that
they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives
around them, but they didn&#8217;t continue to push their high scores in
the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives
too. I felt bad for them.</p>

the Twinkling Shards I needed to fully upgrade my Giant armor and
the Giant&#8217;s Hammer. It was pretty awesome once I did that. I then
fought the two bosses&#8230; I died the first time, but the second I
was more aggressive and got them down pretty quickly. After
getting the Lordvessel, I avenged the girl and advanced the
story. I feel like the end is in sight. I played for almost three

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that if the Capitol is &#8220;surrounded&#8221; by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia&#8230; i.e. very far away&#8230; how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.</p>

<p>Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.</p>

but a little bit disappointing because we don&#8217;t find out what the
feels are of all the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; who gave up&#8212;like Ferris, etc. The
attitudes of the guards was very interesting. The very ending when
they are planning the rebuilding is cool. However, it&#8217;s unclear why
they think they&#8217;ll be able to prevent the same thing from
happening&#8230; there&#8217;s a little bit alluded to with the revision of
the Constitution. I think I would have liked a little bit more of a
vision of Utopia. Overall, it was definitely a masterpiece.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three and a half hours today. I started by
getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel&#8217;s Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I&#8217;d
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn&#8217;t kill him&#8230;). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave&#8230; which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain&#8230; and a major mistake to go down there. I think I&#8217;ll
grind for souls and just buy them.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Get 10 + X? twinkling (10 total &#8212; 4 3 2 1 &#8212; per item, I have
4 armor pieces)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a totally over the top movie. It&#8217;s silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some funny moments and characters&#8212;like the way the CIA
teams act on the &#8220;case&#8221; and Lauren&#8217;s friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the &#8220;super fast&#8221; type without much impact.</p>

<p>There a few moments of real romance&#8212;when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he&#8217;s watching Titantic and the look on Tuck&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there&#8217;s no meaning
behind their actions.</p>

<p>But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren&#8217;t really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t look at Lauren
enough when they&#8217;re talking&#8230; it&#8217;s very unnatural.)</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she&#8217;s trying too hard to look
sexy&#8230; particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other&#8230; it&#8217;s like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.</p>

later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot
higher because of the ring.</p>

World and then worked my way back so I could explore the Darkroot
Garden. I killed the Butterfly and unlocked the magic door, but
then stopped for the night.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film.</p>

<p>I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they&#8217;re
fighting fear itself, but there&#8217;s no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The movie&#8217;s version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.</p>
