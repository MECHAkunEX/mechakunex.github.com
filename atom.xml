Wow, this is a big map. Luckily, I got a multi-story building in
the first row. I plan on getting my FOs up there with the HMG and
advance along that line.

= M2: T1

We advanced into the first line and met a Sniper. It did some real
damage to the 2/2.

= M2: T2

The CO HQ moved into the upper story of the village to get the lay
of the land. The XO followed after activating 1 PLT. Everyone
moved up and spotted the Sniper, who retreated. Its new position
targeted the 2/3 though, who failed to find cover in an Open
Field.

The 1/3 met a Squad in a Gully and received fire from an HMG, as
did the 2/3 in the Open Field. Combat was not too bad though, as
one HMG was taken out immediately and only one casualty hit the
2/3 even though it was under HMG fire as well as being attacked by
a sniper.

= M2: T3

Bn HQ gave us an ammo drop of MG rounds, which will be nice for
this long mission. The CO HQ tried to call in fire mission, but
failed, luckily the XO succeeded with both Arty and Mortar (using
the 3 PLT as observer.) As a master of these things, he also got
the 1/Mtr to launch on the enemy 3/2. The 1st SGT spotted the
Sniper, who was forced to retreat. 1 PLT moved his group forward
and concentrate fire on the E 3/2. The 3 PLT launched a Mortar on
the E2/1. 2 PLT moved into the Woods to recover their wounded men
and rally them while sending a portion, the 1/2 into the hedges to
flank the 4/HMG. Under their own initiative, the 1/2 and 2/3
entered Cover.

We wiped out the 4/HMG and damaged both enemy PLTs, taking no
loses ourselves. Nice!

= M2: T4

2 PLT and 3 PLT advanced while 1 PLT consolidated their attack on
the 3/2. The 2/3 and 1/2 moved to new terrain and spotted the
Sniper again. I'm getting nervous about keeping in communication
with everyone in the coming turns.

The German Litter team rallied into a Fire Team, while the E 2/1
fell back to their position, ouch!  Luckily, nothing else bad
happened, including no contact for either advancing squad. My 2/3
did capture some Germans. The Fire Team that was with the 2/1
survived our attack but the E 3/2 got knocked down.

= M2: T5

The CO HQ started moving towards the Farm with the upper story to
set up shop. The 1st SGT and XO started moving as well. 3rd moved
diagonal and put some mortar on the E Fire team. He tried to spot
the sniper from the upper story but failed. 2nd moved forward and
joined 3rd HQ in the upper story and did spot the sniper. He also
sent the 1/2 forward. The first unleashed some mortar on the
assault team and tried to get his 1/1 to concentrate fire, but
couldn't. On GI, the 1/3 fled to the fields. The 2/3 used their
rifle grenade on the E 2/1. And the 1/2 found some cover.

The E 2/1 fell back! Cowards! So did the Fire team. Weaklings!
Well, it was a wise move by them because the others were
Paralyzed.

= M2: T6

The CO HQ moved towards the Farm and activated those under
him. And commanded the 1/3 to move forward in anticipation of
where the 3rd will end up. The XO had nothing to do. The 1st SGT
activated the next level and moved himself forward. 1st sent men
to capture the paralyzed Germans and scout the orchards and
woods. 3rd PLT moved to the Orchard and reunited with two of his
squads, then sent the 2/3 forward. 2nd PLT launched a mortar into
the fleeing Germans, moved forward, and sent the 1/2 into the
secondary objective. No initiative, but the NCO in 1/2 decided to
seek cover.

The 2/1 launched a grenade, while the Fire team with it fled
off-map. We captured all the Ps and Cs, though. Wow! No Contact on
an A (draw 7!). Nor with a B/5. But the others got a Mortar
spotter and a Sniper, not the worst pulls.

Ouch! The 2/1 has turned into a PPF. Ouch! The 2/3 is a PC and the
1/1 is a CFF.

Wow, that was a mess.

= M2: T7

The CO HQ finally got his leadership post in the Farm
upstairs. The XO tried to call in some spots but was very
unsuccessful. Luckily, I remembered I had a Trained Eye and
spotted the Sniper.

The 2nd moved forward, launched a mortar, and sent the 1/2 towards
the East. The 1st launched their last mortar. The 3rd sent the 1/3
into the open fields.

In the initiative phase, the 1/2 found cover but the 1/3 failed
to.

The enemy Mtr failed to call for a fire, nice! The sniper
retreated into terrain under fire. The E 2/1 found some cover.

1/2 saw No Contact! But, the 1/3 ran into a squad and an HMG nest.

The 1/2 got hit for an L. We knocked out the Sniper and Spotter,
but got a PPF in return.

= M2: T8

The CO HQ activated his troops and called in a double Fire mission
from the Battalion. The XO sat on his hands, shown up by the CO
HQ, while the 1st SGT call in the PLT HQs.

The 1 PLT rallied a paralyzed unit and moved forward with him,
then reconstituted the 2/1. The 3 PLT rallied and then launched a
mortar on the church---his last. Then sent a Fire team into the
fields (so that the church was not All Pinned.) The 2 PLT launched
a mortar as well. In GI, some Fire teams reconstituted, while the
3/1 advanced into the woods.

The 3/1 was safe in the woods. The 1/3 got a CL, ouch. The E 2/1
resisted while the church was decimated into a FFCC, with no more
HMG.

= M2: T9

The CO HQ tried to get another Bn FM but failed. We need to clear
out those last two pieces of terrain this turn to secure them for
the finish. Luckily, the XO was able to do so and got another
double mission.

2 PLT sent in the 2/2 into the fields to Keep Up The Fire! Then
launched his last mortar on the E 2/1. The 3 PLT moved over with
his platoon and rallied the 1/3, then sent them back with a
Casualty. The 1 PLT advanced and launched a bazooka on the
church. In GI, the 2/2 got under cover and a Litter team fled.

The foolish Germans tried to Fall Back, but everyone was
Pinned. One Fire Team ran away on its own though. The valiant 2/2
got a CF. While the Germans were reduced to a CL. The Germans in
Church were Paralyzed.

Thankfully, we got out 3 Casualties.

= M2: T10

After activating his subordinates, the CO HQ visited the
casualties and rallied the Litter teams into the 2/2. The 2 PLT HQ
moved into the fields and commanded the Fire Team left over into
the fields to the south. The 1st SGT activated the 1 PLT then
moved into the fields and rallied the 2/3, then sent them back
with a Casualty. 1 PLT sent the 2/1 to capture the hedge and the
3/1 to capture the church and the prisoners therein. On GI, the
soldiers in the hedge found cover.

= M2: Close-Out

I ended up wiping out the 1/2 and had 7 casualties total. But I
got 58 XP. Here's what I bought:
| 58 | CO HQ to V         | 55 |
| 55 | CO XO to V         | 52 |

This was much more tactically difficult than the last one, but I
had some good luck there too. It was really fun. I am so impressed
with how deep this game is. I definitely would have much less fun
if I really had to interact with the deck though, my program is so
awesome... almost six hours this time!

I started in the first Mission and did the set up in about twenty
minutes. The back row is pretty fortified (all +2) but the middle
had a nice Farm with potential heavy cover that I was going to
designate as the AP, but the first row had a hill that I'll plan
on using to put my FO or HMG.

My plan is to use 2 PLT to get that position. 1 PLT will get a
Village and 3 PLT advance on the flank. We'll see how it goes!

= M1: Turn 1

I moved 1/3 to the Village, 2/1 to the Hedge, 2/2 to the Hill, and
3/3 to the Marsh. The first two were hit by incoming artillery and
mortar. I got two Cs and 1 F. Yikes!

At least the other two didn't have Contact and I got 4 XP for
clearing the first row.

= M1: Turn 2

I moved 2 PLT forward into the clear space and spotted the Mtr
Spotter and laid Heck on him.

1 PLT HQ rescued his troops by going into the Village, commanding
them to grab the Casualty and then do a PLT Move back to the
staging area and then Rallied them back together.

3 PLT was safe and advanced forward.

I got a lot of General Initiative, so 3/3 and 2/2 moved forward
and sought cover.

The 2/2 spotted a Patrol squad and during combat, they got an
unlucky draw and were reduced to two Fire Ts and a Casualty. Nice!

= M1: Turn 3

Everyone moved forward, especially since the Mtr Spotter is out of
missions and disappeared. Heck will be brought down on the Germany
Squad out there, but to be safe, 3 PLT stayed behind while 3/3
took the Initiative and Concentrated their fire.

One of the Fire Teams moved back though! But the one that remained
was reduced to a Litter.

= M1: Turn 4

There was Trouble on the Flank, so I couldn't move forward. This
is really annoying because I want to capture those enemies. At
least, I can send reinforcements. Nothing much interesting could
be done though... stupid HQ! No use for my Initiative either!

Luckily, they didn't take their C and move back. Phew!

Very quick turn.

= M1: Turn 5

Ugh, stupid HQ. They demand a report.

1/3 went forward. 2/2 and 2/3 went forward. 3/2 moved as
well. Should be a nice amount of fun!

[I just realized the Fire Team that fell back would have gone off
the map. Nice!]

Capture a Casualty and a Litter.

The A contact ended up being a Sniper in the same spot as
2/2. Weird! Hopefully that will help.  The other two were No
Contact, which is nice, but the third ended up being an HMG on a
Hill. Luckily, it is in LOS of my HMG, so we'll have a bit of a
battle, plus I'll start a fire mission next turn!

In combat, the HMG and its target were Pinned, but my 1/2 got a
paralyzed unit. Yikes!

I ended up with a lot of XP for this turn because I got four PCs
cleared as well as the prisoners and the HQ event. Nice!

= M1: Turn 6

The XO tried to call in a fire mission on the HMG through the Arty
FO, but failed, ugh. Luckily, the 1 SGT had a lot of commands and
activated everybody else, then commanded the 1/1 to spot the
sniper and succeeded and sent the 1/1 into the Woods, knowing
they'd be targeted by enemy Arty. The 3 PLT moved up and put some
Mortar fire on the HMG, while the 2 PLT HQ held put. Finally the 1
PLT HQ did a similar rescue and got his Paralyzed team into a
Litter and got them out.

[I was a little skeptical of these heroic HQs, so I read the rules
and found out that you can't move when Exposed, so you can't move
twice, D'oh!. I'll stop doing that!]

The Sniper fled back into a Hedge while the Arty launched on the
1/1. The HMG was so shaken that it couldn't move. Nice!

Luckily, no contact in those Woods.

= M1: Turn 7

The XO failed again to bring in fire support on the HMG. Lame! He
did, however, spot the Sniper from up on his hill. The 1 SGT
activated everyone then rallied the Litter and commanded it into
the Woods. The 1 PLT moved in the Woods and Rallied the 1/1. The 3
PLT launched another Mortar attack. The 2 PLT moved into the Hedge
under Sniper fire, knowing that it would retreat now that it was
spotted, laying down a Phone Line on the way out. While there, he
tried to Rally his P unit, but failed.  Under their own
initiative, a Fire Team took a Casualty back to the CP, while the
P unit tried to recover again and failed.

The enemy sniper retreated while the enemy HMG continued to hold
their position and take our attack, which Paralyzes it and knocks
it out.

= M1: Turn 8

1 SGT commanded the Fire Team to go back to 1 PLT who commanded it
to join the 1/3 and advance into Obj 1. 2 PLT moved south and
tried Rally his P unit to a Litter then a Fire, then sent it
north. He plans to reunite next turn. 3 PLT moved into Obj 2 with
the 2/3. On their own initiative, the Fire joined the 2/2, while
the 1/3 sought cover.

The 1/3 had contact with the 3/Mtr Spotter and took some fire and
ended up with a Litter team.

= M1: Turn 9

The CO called the 1st SGT to run the troops. The 3rd had nothing
to do. The 2nd moved back and tried to spot the 3/Mtr, but
couldn't. Meanwhile, the 1st did spot him. No one was able to take
any initiative, unfortunately.

The enemy launched another Arty attack, and thus spent his ability
and left. This dismantled the 1/3 into a P and an F,
ouch. Luckily, the Litter team was missed.

= M1: Turn 10

As each unit reported back what happened in the previous turn, 1
PLT HQ moved forward and rallied all his troops back into the
1/3. Everyone else held their position and the day was won.

= M1: Close-out

I ended up with 3 casualties and 34 XP. Nice! Here's what I
bought:

| 33 | Co XO to L         | 32 |

This was a totally awesome experience. It was very tense and even
though I won, I had lots of difficult decisions and fretting. It
was very cool! I think I only broke the rules a little bit. It's
amazing that I played for five and a half hours for one session!

I think the best part about this one was how different the

they were very confident in Eindhoven but were beat down.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Band of Brothers/">Band of Brothers</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Battle: Los Angeles, starring Aaron Eckhart (2011) (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2018/03/01/Movie--Battle--Los-Angeles--starring-Aaron-Eckhart--2011--1.html"/><updated>2018-03-01T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2018/03/01/Movie--Battle--Los-Angeles--starring-Aaron-Eckhart--2011--1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2018/03/01/Movie--Battle--Los-Angeles--starring-Aaron-Eckhart--2011--1.html">Movie: Battle: Los Angeles, starring Aaron Eckhart (2011) (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2018/">2018</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2018/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2018/03/01/">01</a></span></span><pre class="content">This movie is so awesome.
