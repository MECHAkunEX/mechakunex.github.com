    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today for almost three hours and beat the game. I beat
levels 6, 7, and 8 as Maria. Then, I beat 8 as Richter. Then I
beat 4&#8217; as Richter to get to 5&#8217;. I did 5&#8217; as Maria (and continued
on to beat the game on the same continue.)</p>

<p>When I finally beat Dracula as Richter, I wasn&#8217;t hit at all in his
human form, but was hit just once in his giant man-bat form (by
the blue energy wave, that I think you are supposed to duck
under.)</p>

<p>This is a very satisfying game to beat. I will definitely
continue playing it in the future&#8230; especially since I invested
in a PC Engine to be able to play it. It&#8217;s a blast.</p>

<p>Although&#8230; I&#8217;m annoyed that I only have 96% completion on the
save screen&#8230; despite having done everything in the game. I&#8217;m not
sure what I&#8217;m supposed to do to bring it to 100%.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun episode. I liked the beginning and the montage of
sleuthing, especially the references to Holmes stories and how it
ended up being relevant for the larger story. The concept behind
The Woman was interesting and different, but I feel like time
moved way to quickly in this episode. It seems like almost 2
years of time passed, because the year they&#8217;re texting, there&#8217;s
the six months she&#8217;s pretending to be dead, the months after the
break down, plus the two months she&#8217;s actually dead, etc. It&#8217;s a
bit unreasonable, because the time table of the earlier episodes
seemed much faster pace. I thought the advancement of some of
the extra characters was fun: Watson&#8217;s girlfriends (although we
barely get a hint of why he&#8217;d be failing in love) and Molly. I
hope Sherlock shows Molly some love. This is a fun show, but I
get the impression that I&#8217;ll be very annoyed that there won&#8217;t be
any closure in the sixth episode.</p>

Wii to get the input lag done. It seemed to make a difference,
because I improved my performance in such a short time. This is so
tough. I can&#8217;t wait to beat it and go back to playing this game
on an easier and more enjoyable difficulty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a cute movie with a pretty unique plot. The main girl was
cute and wholesome. I feel like the ending was a bit empty though,
because other than going to AA there was no explanation of how
Arthur changed. Th end of the movie suggested that Arthur&#8217;s only
problem was that he drank a lot (and perhaps having so many
resources exacerbated the impact of that), but didn&#8217;t deal at all
with his lack of knowledge, etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the morning, we played for about a half hour and beat level 4&#8217;
via the secret route&#8212;beating Camilla&#8212;but not getting to 5&#8217;. I
started on stage 5 a bit, but was pretty beat down.</p>

<p>Later, I played for about an hour and a half and beat
stage 5. Eventually I was able to use the watch to get through up
to Death without getting hit at all&#8230; by pausing the action just
before the large green monsters. Sometimes this game seems totally
impossible and brutalizing. The key seems to always be using the
sub-weapons effectively and breaking the challenges. Or, learning
pitch perfect timing and getting through unscathed&#8230; but mostly
doing the sub-weapons just right. It&#8217;s a fascinating design.</p>

<p>After I mastered that, it took about 7 tries to kill Death. I
stuck with the Cross. I used an Item Crash early and pummeled
him. I dodged the huge skulls by staying to the left and
right. The melee fight was pure stick-and-move. It is so
satisfying to win at this game.</p>

<p>After Death was dead, I fought the Vampire Bat and was killed
Medusa in the Boss rush stage. I decided to go back and fight
Camilla again, because supposedly you need to beat Death to get
the secret exit&#8230; but no luck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really fascinating episode. I liked how there were
some many subplots and little stories. I think the Moriarty
character is really cool, but I thought the actor wasn&#8217;t a good
choice. I expected someone older and more menacing
looking. Instead, this guy looks like an angry bully
kid. Hopefully as we see him more, he&#8217;ll look more the part.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I played this game with my son for about an hour. We
beat level 2 the normal way after getting Maria. Now I have
unlocked up to 4 and 4&#8217;. We tried 4 but were totally brutalized by
the boss playing as Maria (she&#8217;s really weak.) We also rescued two
of the non-playable girls. Still&#8230; amazing game.</p>

<p>Later in the day we played for about thirty minutes and beat level
4&#8217; via the normal route and got to stage 5. I wish the game a
better way of tracking which levels/exits you have done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a PC Engine and got this game. It is really fun to play
it again, especially without an emulator and save states, so I
have to do it better. Additionally, I&#8217;ve had a lot more
experience with the other early Castlevania games so I&#8217;m just
better at playing it. It&#8217;s really fun and smooth feeling, despite
having classic Casltevania stickiness.</p>

<p>I played only as Richter today and I did all secret exits. I went
from 0 to 1 to 2&#8217; to 3&#8217; to 4&#8217;. I fought the Serpent, the Minotaur,
the Werewolf, and the floaty head thing. It&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was very interesting to read about Nouverre and his ideas. I
like the expression that ballets should not be like &#8220;plays&#8221; but
should be like &#8220;paintings&#8221;, because with the limited language of
pantomime, you can&#8217;t express detailed, dynamic
stories&#8230; everything has to be very extreme and relatively static
to be understandable&#8230; like a painting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year ago, I beat the first quest of Legend of Zelda. I&#8217;d
never really played the second quest, but I knew it existed, so
after doing Castlevania II, I decided to knock it out.</p>

<p>I played for about 2 hours and 15 minutes and got up to level 4
and had about 9 hearts and other stuff from the overworld. It was
very painful to gather all the money. I decided that I wanted to
buy the arrows and wanted to try the Money Making Game trick, but
I needed to plug in the second controller. I was scared of
accidentally bumping the NES and causing it to glitch, so I
figured I&#8217;d save first. I stupidly didn&#8217;t realize that when you
do &#8220;Continue&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t also save, so I just held down RESET,
saved the SRAM on my PowerPak, and rebooted. And thus I deleted
all my progress. Ouch.</p>

<p>I decided to play again, but with a Game Genie code to give me
more access to money, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do the rupee grinding
like I did the first time. It took about one hour to get back to
where I was before. Then another 2 and a half to win. 3:34 total.</p>

<p>This version of the game is much more difficult. There are parts
where you almost have to play it like a stealth game because you
are so limited in your ability to take damage.</p>

<p>I like that the maps are rearranged, but since I used online maps,
it didn&#8217;t really matter&#8230; I don&#8217;t have the patience to make my
own tools to do mapping for myself. I would never look at a map in
game like Castlevania (one of the Metroid-style ones) because the
in-game map system is so good. A game like Legend of Zelda that
had a really good map like there, maybe with the ability to make
notes like in Etrian Odyssey. That would be cool and you could
probably randomly generate the maps to have infinite fun. I wonder
if it would be too much like Sudoku though (in the sense that you
would always start off by trying to find the Blue Ring and then
the Candle, etc, etc.)</p>

<p>I liked the final message: &#8220;You are great. You have an amazing
wisdom and power.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through this game today using a walkthrough, maps, and
an infinite lives/hearts code. I feel like the hearts code was
essential so I didn&#8217;t have to grind. The lives code didn&#8217;t seem
to make much of a difference, because the game is pretty easy
(re: Egoraptor&#8217;s dissection of its layout problems.) The
walkthrough and maps were definitely essential because it is so
confusing and backwards. I feel like there wasn&#8217;t really anything
valuable in this game, although the mechanics felt good, but it
just wasn&#8217;t anywhere near as challenging as Castlevania 1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a crazy movie. It is very disturbing, but in a way that is
always beneath the surface in a hidden way. The double layered
fantasy world that the girls live in is terrible, but what&#8217;s most
disturbing is that it is hiding a worse world. The fantasy within
that is really insane and feels very Japanese in its absurdity. I
liked that about it a lot. The visual effects and photography were
really interesting and different&#8212;particularly the beginning
sequence was crazy.</p>
