    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours and got to the first boss of Anor
Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can&#8217;t really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
<em>REDACTED</em>ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early <em>REDACTED</em>ism.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well&#8230; not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a pretty cheesy comic book movie. The story was quite
different than others, with its god-like characters and its vast
universe.</p>

<p>On one hand, I liked that it didn&#8217;t really dwell on the fact that
aliens exist, etc. But on the hand, that was the most interesting
part of the movie, but it was also totally unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The characters all play totally to type and lots of character
development consists of almost a single scene to establish the type
and then the movie moves on. (Most of the scenes with Blake
Lively.)</p>

<p>My other favourite scene was the opening dog fight with the
experimental planes. It was interesting how it foreshadowed the
ending. It was unfortunate that an otherwise heroic moment was
shattered by a cliche character reveal.</p>

<p>And one more&#8230; when Blake saw through the disguise. Brilliant.</p>

<p>But despite a few high moments, it&#8217;s a pretty vapid movie.</p>

played through the entire game again because he forgot to record
the last segment and so lost the progress. It&#8217;s amazing that he&#8217;s
so patient and dedicated enough to do that. Also, last time he
showed some really funny clips from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,
including a really great scene where a whole bunch of people were
squeezing into a tiny room. It was hilarious!</p>

by killing the gargoyle and then all the sentinels again&#8212;I
wanted to get all the chests&#8230; I forgot one. Then it took me a
while to figure out how to get to the chapel. I fought my way to
the fog gate, but then ran out of time for the night, so I walked
back. I wanted to do an epic jump, but misjudged the distance and
plummeted to my death. Nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight. I explored the rest of
Sen&#8217;s Fortress (or at least, I got to the boss) and then I
unlocked a shortcut to the boss, and then I tried to fight the
boss many many times. I could generally avoid almost every single
attack&#8230; occasionally I would get grabbed, but I could generally
heal myself. The main problem was that I kept getting knocked off
the tower by him. I probably fought him about 20 times. I explored
a number of different weapon options. Probably the best was
putting a Lightning enhancement on my Iaito, but I didn&#8217;t have
enough to keep using it. Eventually I used the Drake Sword
(because Iaito&#8217;s bleed didn&#8217;t effect the Golem.) I won and it felt
real good. I explored the next area a tiny bit. I killed all the
Sentinels and got a level from that. I&#8217;m excited to be making
steady progress.</p>

Quelaag on my third or so time today. It was pretty epic to dodge
her attacks and take her down. (But I used all five of my healing
charges.) After taking care of business down there, I went back to
near Sen&#8217;s Fortress and fought the demon underneath the
blacksmith, upgraded my weapon a bit, and then started into the
fortress. I died many times learning how to get through the first
area and exploring it a bit. I feel like I have a good sense of
the layout but not what I&#8217;m supposed to do in there. Maybe I need
to drop down to the pit and do something there? More tomorrow, I
guess.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for almost five hours tonight because the wife went to
bed early. I had a rough time.</p>

<p>I started in Blightown, near the boss, so I tried to fight her a
few times. She&#8217;s a demon spider thing with a nude top (her hair
covers her tas.) That&#8217;s important because there was an amazing
message outside her arena. It said &#8220;Amazing chest ahead&#8221;. It&#8217;s so
funny because you normally see that same message when there is a
good /treasure/ chest near by.</p>

<p>After failing utterly fighting her <em>and</em> realizing I hadn&#8217;t
repaired my equipment in a while (I didn&#8217;t buy the thing to do it
at any bonfire), I decided to leave and go do that.</p>

<p>I tried to escape from the area the way that I can, but I wasn&#8217;t
strong enough with my alternative weapon to get through. I
probably tried maybe five times. It was rough.</p>

<p>So, I decided to go via the water wheel and the new areas. The
first time, I fell off the wheel. Nice. Then there were some
really rough dudes at the top of the water wheel that would knock
me off cause I&#8217;d get caught on the geometry. (This whole area, by
the way, has a really choppy frame rate.)</p>

<p>After I finally got back up to the top of the tower, I decided to
just run past the guys rather than fighting them. That worked
well.</p>

<p>I went back to the Undead Asylum after buying the repair kit and
got the ring that lets you walk through the swamp easily, and I
went and got the Spider Shield to protect myself from poison
attacks.</p>

<p>With that stuff in hand, I worked on getting to the Fire Keeper
Soul in Blighttown. I did a few rounds&#8212;first I killed all the
poison snipers and then I went back and sniped at all the dogs
from above (they gang up on you and hit <em>real</em> hard.) Eventually
it worked out and I got it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t actually use it and, in fact, getting it
seemed to kill the Fire Keeper in the Firelink Shrine. Ooops.</p>

<p>So, I went back to Blighttown and tried to fight the spider boss a
few more times. I got a pretty good rhythm going, but I&#8217;ll have to
perfect it later.</p>

- Explore the Blighttown - Swamp more

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie and the other ones were
pretty bad. I think their biggest failure was being too fantasy and
with too many monsters, etc. This movie doesn&#8217;t have that problem,
but it is definitely not as good as previous ones.</p>

<p>There are some fun moments of <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow being <em>REDACTED</em> Sparrow. A
few absurd fights and chases. It&#8217;s a fairly fun and crazy movie.
The mermaids are totally beautiful and the mermaid who serves as
the love interest has a very sweet and innocent feel to her.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about a lot of the movie, it is pretty absurd
and silly, but I&#8217;m not sure I should really expect anything
different. It&#8217;s a solid B+. I think with a few more exciting fights
and a bit more plot coherence it could have been an A-.</p>

working my way through Blighttown. It was very scary and tough. I

rough. Quite a few times, the dogs at the very beginning caught me
off guard and decimated me.</p>

<p>Probably the worst time was when I was working my way back to the
swamp the first time, I attacked and the animation pushed me over
the edge of the cliff and I lost 7.7k souls&#8230; about a level where
I am in the game. After that, it was really hard to get back to
the swamp.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very fun in this game to slowly push through to the next area
and then the next, etc. One thing that I dislike compared to
Demon&#8217;s Souls is that, because there is no hub, you can&#8217;t get back
to a place to buy things, like arrows, if you need them
easily. It&#8217;s kind of frustrating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three and half hours tonight. I went through
the rest of the Undead Parish and then Lower Undead Burg and then
I beat the Dragon in the depths. I beat the Gargoyle on my first
try tonight by spamming it real hard. The demon in the lower burg
took quite a few tries before I took him down. I just got locked
in a combo the first times and couldn&#8217;t recover, but once I got
the dogs out of the way it was easy. When I was exploring the
Depths I got surprise attacked many times and was surprised by
some traps, but eventually I got through. I fought the dragon at
the end about seven times. The third or so I tried to fight as a
human with a phantom helper, but I wasn&#8217;t skilled enough to win
that time. Eventually I got good at running away from him and then
swooping in to his back for attacking. When I finally won, I did
it by hacking off his tail and then winning by attrition.</p>

<p>I think I lost about 6k souls tonight through various hiccups.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still enjoying the game and finding it very fun to push
through. I&#8217;m getting close to being able to diversify my equipment,
I think. That&#8217;ll be nice to experiment with.</p>
