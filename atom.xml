    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie is like a video game: lots of sets with a few scenes set
there before they move on to the next, fairly disconnected
event. It has very high production value. The acting can be a bit
bad. Eustace is pretty terrible, especially in the
beginning. Caspian is quite hammy. Lucy is probably the best player
in the film.</p>

<p>I think the story of this movie/book is not as strong as the other
ones, because the ending is very uneventful. You think they&#8217;re
fighting fear itself, but there&#8217;s no real pay-off because the enemy
is never really named or described in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The movie&#8217;s version of Eustace during back from being a dragon was
much less epic than I remember it being in the book, which was my
favourite part.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hank&#8217;s relationships with Lillian and Dagny totally mirror his
philosophical development. Francisco makes the point to him that
the laws that he follows in business should be the same laws he
follows with men&#8212;meaning in the government or &#8220;public&#8221;
sector&#8212;namely that they should respect rights and be mutually
beneficial. Similarly, Lillian doesn&#8217;t respect his rights and
actually wants their relationship to /not/ be beneficial because
then it is a sacrifice and thus &#8220;pure love&#8221;. The idea is that it is
only loving to give things undeservedly, otherwise it is simply a
trade and there&#8217;s no need for the concept of &#8220;love&#8221;. In contrast,
Dagny wants to make a mutual beneficial &#8220;trade&#8221; and insists
upon. The concept of love is, therefore, basically just a name for
being willing to trade your whole self and let down your deepest
walls.</p>

<p>It makes me think of Hayek&#8217;s comment that the laws of the market
would suffocate the family and the laws of the family would destroy
the market. I think there he is referring to trust and pooling
resources, not mutually beneficial interactions, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the speech by Francisco at James&#8217; wedding and now I know
what everyone is talking about with the very long speaking
parts. That part, by the way, was pretty great. It&#8217;s like the San
Sebastian mines, which I enjoyed but a million times more
vicious.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting at this point in the book that we really
don&#8217;t know that much more than the characters but it&#8217;s so obvious
to the reader that John Galt, the third student, it collecting
people to some place of freedom, but that hasn&#8217;t occurred to the
main characters at all. Despite their being of monumental
intelligence.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m now past Part I and the story is still pretty enthralling. I
still haven&#8217;t got to the famous speeches that the characters give,
but there are always long dialogues. I wonder if I&#8217;m just
impervious to thinking they are too long?</p>

<p>Something I appreciate about the book is the development of the
relationship between Dagny and Rearden. I particularly like how
guilty Rearden feels about it, because I think it reinforces some
morals that I support. I also find it fascinating for Ayn Rand to
explore the concept of love&#8217;s interaction with individualism and
self-esteem. I think it is pretty compelling. I must say though,
that I find the scenes between them too a-feminist. I&#8217;m kind of
amazed by it, actually, given how feminist the rest of the book is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing with the dialogue in Atlas Shrugged is that it is often
so long without enough &#8220;he said&#8221;/&#8221;she said&#8221; that you lose track of
who is talking. It is a bit frustrating and one of the only
examples I can think of as &#8220;usability&#8221; problems with books.</p>

<p>For example, in this awesome dialogue from page 162, I&#8217;m not
totally sure the speakers are correct:</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the
sun losing energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering,
then, what it would be like in the last days of the world. I think
it would be &#8230; like this. Growing colder and things stopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hank: &#8220;I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun
was exhausted, men would find a substitute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dagny: &#8220;You did? Funny, I thought that, too.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today on a long plane ride, I started reading Atlas Shrugged. I
read to Chapter 7. It&#8217;s a fascinating book. I don&#8217;t find it as
transparently philosophical as I expected it would be&#8230; it moves
much too slow and has too much detail to feel that way. In some
ways, it is actually quite subtle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to not compare the book&#8217;s story to the story of the
movie. I don&#8217;t know how the movie could have been improved, but
there are quite a few things much much better about the book.</p>

<p>For example, the explanation from Francisco about the San Sebastian
mine is amazing. It is delightfully vindictive and cruel in the
best way possible what he did. It&#8217;s not at all clear in the movie
what his intention was or how horrible it makes other people
look.</p>

<p>In a less significant way, the guests at the party are great
because Ayn Rand puts the words of her real life enemies in their
mouths. I think many casual readers would not realize that their
absurd opinions are actually promoted by real intellectuals of the
day.</p>

<p>I like the subtle dig that all countries around the world are &#8220;the
People&#8217;s state of such-and-such&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the movie, Hank seems totally empty with regard to Lillian and
his family, but in the book the relationship is much more complex
and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the long discussion
regarding their sex life and the Victorian conception of feminine
virtue.</p>

Londo today after finally getting past the Skeleton
Archers. Totally brutal. It was very challenging to fight all the
Knights as well, but I was able to get most of them to follow me
to a place I could fight them one-on-one in peace. The boss is
insane, because there are two of them, I can&#8217;t really defend
properly. I think I need a fire-based weapon to be able to do
it. I decided to go to the Painted World again and do a little
grinding to get stronger.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my third or fourth time reading the book, I enjoyed it just as
much as past times. It was one of the first books I ever read about
<em>REDACTED</em>ism, so it defined my thinking in many ways. On this most
recent reading, I noticed that many things I find particularly
interesting were only discussed very briefly. Despite being
incredibly long, on one hand it is a tiny thimble-full of what you
could learn about Joseph Smith and early <em>REDACTED</em>ism.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I played for about three hours. I went through Anor Londo a
little bit and got to the Painted World, which I completed. The
wheel skeletons were pretty tough. I left the boss and the poison
dragon thing for future attempts. When I got back in Anor, I
pushed forward a bit. I got to the huge skeleton archers, but they
knocked me off the ledge, so I died. I ended up losing 17k and 4
humanity that was on my body. I got back once but died again. On
the second time I needed to get back, I got killed by the
lightning drake things on the way. Well&#8230; not actually killed, I
accidentally jumped off as I was trying to run away. It was really
dumb. I love the way this game makes you feel dumb when you die.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a pretty cheesy comic book movie. The story was quite
different than others, with its god-like characters and its vast
universe.</p>

<p>On one hand, I liked that it didn&#8217;t really dwell on the fact that
aliens exist, etc. But on the hand, that was the most interesting
part of the movie, but it was also totally unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The characters all play totally to type and lots of character
development consists of almost a single scene to establish the type
and then the movie moves on. (Most of the scenes with Blake
Lively.)</p>

<p>My other favourite scene was the opening dog fight with the
experimental planes. It was interesting how it foreshadowed the
ending. It was unfortunate that an otherwise heroic moment was
shattered by a cliche character reveal.</p>

<p>And one more&#8230; when Blake saw through the disguise. Brilliant.</p>

<p>But despite a few high moments, it&#8217;s a pretty vapid movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little less than an hour tonight. I gained a level
by killing the gargoyle and then all the sentinels again&#8212;I
wanted to get all the chests&#8230; I forgot one. Then it took me a
while to figure out how to get to the chapel. I fought my way to
the fog gate, but then ran out of time for the night, so I walked
back. I wanted to do an epic jump, but misjudged the distance and
plummeted to my death. Nice.</p>

<p>TODO list:
- Kill Stray Demon (in Aslyum)
- Upgrade Iaito to Fire element
- Explore the rest of Sen&#8217;s Fortress (Pit)</p>
