    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half while we were watching a TV
show on my wife&#8217;s laptop. It was relaxing to grind a bit. I got
to the port town and met the guy who knew Guy. The story is very
simple so far, but it&#8217;s nice in a Dragon-Quest-y way.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/10/21/Game&#8211;Castlevania&#8211;NES&#8211;1986&#8211;4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to beat this game today. I used a cheat code to give
infinite lines, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about continues and
replaying sections over and over (at least, until I got passed
them once, or in the case of the stage before a boss battle, more
times.) However, even with that, I was able to get to
Frankenstein&#8217;s in 3 lives. I took another three to get to stage
15 (the stage that ends in Death.) I did all that in about 30
minutes. I played the stage before Death for about 25 minutes
before church. Then I had a very NES moment and left the system
running while I was at church.</p>

<p>When I got back, I played Death&#8217;s sequence over and over again
for an hour and a half. Eventually I decided to focus on not
losing any life at all during the hallway with the two axe
knights and the brutal Medusa heads, by willingly sacrificing
lots of hearts. This turned out to be a good move and I gradually
improved. It took maybe three times of getting to Death with full
health before I defeated him. It was awesome.</p>

<p>It only took about 15 minutes to get to Dracula after that. It
took another hour and a half before I beat Dracula. It got to the
point where I could get passed the first form without taking any
damage pretty reliably, but then I had to work on my moves to
fight the second form. Eventually I decided to try the potion
rather than the cross, because the cross didn&#8217;t seem to do much
damage. This was an awesome move. The potion doesn&#8217;t do any
damage, but it stunlocks him so he can&#8217;t move. Provided I didn&#8217;t
have the double shot, I was able to lay into him for two hits,
then stun, then repeat. I was triumphant!</p>

<p>Altogether, I beat the game in about four hours. It felt so good
to do it. Even though I used a code, it was a pretty weak code
because I had to do everything. It&#8217;s a good example about what
I&#8217;d like games to do&#8212;be like spaced repetition systems (like
Anki), have me do a stage until I can beat it reliably, then move
on, but don&#8217;t show me something that is now easy (or moderate,
but with random swings all the time.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad I gave this game a chance. Initially, the controls
felt so gross, but now I really love their unique stickiness.</p>

show. I didn&#8217;t notice anything wrong with Allison&#8217;s dancing. I&#8217;m
one of the &#8220;80% who don&#8217;t know anything about ballet&#8221;. It&#8217;s kind
of sad that she seems to have such contempt for ballet fans, like
myself, who think it&#8217;s all beautiful and can&#8217;t notice flaws. I
also felt bad for Allison when she talked with her family&#8230; she
don&#8217;t seem very supportive of her in the way she needs.</p>

got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool &#8220;abilitease&#8221;. I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I&#8217;ve
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn&#8217;t realize it. But
now, it&#8217;s quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It&#8217;s cute so far though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn&#8217;t
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn&#8217;t (Craig&#8217;s conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts&#8217; character was very cute,
although we don&#8217;t learn anything about her, other than that she&#8217;s
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don&#8217;t really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

I&#8217;d heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very

Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can&#8217;t dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a &#8220;bullet&#8221; is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn&#8217;t get
passed the title screen&#8230; it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

bone pillars&#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.</p>

<p>I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don&#8217;t like
that I can&#8217;t restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad&#8230; my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>

embellishments of the story, particularly the relationship of the
Evil Queen and her brother, were really cool. Kristen Stewart was
beautiful in it and played the part very well. I thought she was
awkward fighting, but feel like it was purposeful. Definitely a

Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man&#8217;s
stage. She killed a penguin! She&#8217;s getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time&#8230; something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn&#8217;t have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult&#8212;basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It&#8217;s similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you&#8217;re basically toast.</p>

<p>The part I got to, where there&#8217;s Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it&#8217;s super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It&#8217;s a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.</p>

controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I&#8217;m moving it away from myself. It&#8217;s
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the &#8220;stealth&#8221; mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game for about an hour and a half. I got my house
all set up and I did all the &#8220;recharging&#8221; missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don&#8217;t feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I&#8217;m pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren&#8217;t precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I&#8217;ll probably get used to it as I play. It&#8217;s a fun little
game&#8230; definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn&#8217;t have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>
