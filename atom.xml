    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a really rad movie. It had a similar amazing look as 300,
but was much more fantasy oriented. The actions of the Gods in the
movie are awesome and not quite like anything I&#8217;d ever seen
before. The actions are the humans are exciting and down to Earth
in a neat contrasting way. Mickey Rourke does an amazing job as a
crazy warlord. The movie is a really great spectacle piece and is
totally worth it just for the way the Greek Gods are presented.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a cool spy-action movie. I like how it emphasizes the
&#8220;soft&#8221; part of spy work (but not as much as something like
/Spygame/.) And, I think the fight scenes are really cool because
they are so slow and feel realistic. In a strange way, her
controlled fighting makes it almost less exciting, because she
seems so confident and in control all the time. There was lots of
neat camera work&#8212;mainly during the chase sequences. And, the
structuring of the story telling (in the beginning, she&#8217;s narrating
to someone else) is interesting. The one thing I think could have
been a lot better about the movie was the final reveal: the reason
for the betrayal could have been more meaningful and cooler. But,
overall, it was a pretty rad movie. I can imagine watching more
movies with Gina Carano starring.</p>

    <id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/blog/2012/05/13/Game&#8211;Star-Ocean&#8211;The-Last-Hope-International&#8211;PS3&#8211;2010&#8211;3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played another 30-ish minutes of the game. I decided that I&#8217;m
not interested enough in this game to play it. The story seems
fine, maybe a bit cliche. The interesting thing to me was the
setting of the intro movie, which was abandoned pretty instantly
and now I&#8217;m on random medieval planet (like the first three
games.) I&#8217;ll ignore a boring story if the gameplay is awesome,
but&#8230;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember what the combat system was like for the third
game (I remember liking it, but I feel like it was similar to
this) but I&#8217;m not compelled by this one at all. It&#8217;s a cross
between way too easy and way too frustrating. For example, most
battles can be won by simply pressing X over and over. There&#8217;s a
&#8220;blindside&#8221; system, but it&#8217;s basically impossible to use when you
are ganged up on, and when you aren&#8217;t ganged up on, you can just
time your attacks to never need to dodge. It&#8217;s frustrating that
you can&#8217;t really use it well. The targeting system is really
frustrating because it never seems to go where you want and
there&#8217;s no way to lock on to a target. The field is really bad,
because sometimes you&#8217;ll run at an enemy from behind, but the hit
detection is off, so you end up getting them from the side and you
get a Surprise attack, even though you clearly snuck up on them
from behind. Argh! The controls in combat are really laggy with
hidden timers or something. This is the worst when it comes to
jumping. You&#8217;ll hit the button and then have a noticeable delay
before the jump happens.</p>

<p>The game aspires to feel like a third-person action game, but it&#8217;s
not good enough at it to make the comparison a good thing. It
pales in comparison to Bayonetta. I don&#8217;t think I have the time
and interest to play 50 hours (the median time on
HowLongToBeat.com) of something that is not totally amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve played tri-Ace games released after this, because I
can imagine that if I played this on release, I would be skeptical
of their ability to continue to deliver hits. But, Resonance of
Fate was amaaaazing, so tri-Ace still has it.</p>

<p>So long, Star Ocean.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love this movie. It&#8217;s so inspirational and moving. I particularly
like the deep connection between it and the Gospel. I think it hits
the nail on the head in so many ways and is incredibly
pro-religion, of a sorts. I&#8217;ve read the book and I like both of
them for different reasons. It&#8217;s hard to say a lot about a movie I
just gush over.</p>

Milk Barn. I loved looking at each of the different products in
the store. There was more clear Japanese translations. It was also
funny to have him role-play as York a little bit. It&#8217;s strange

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie has a very unique and interesting premise: a dystopia
where vampires have become the norm and humans are rare. The
beginning of the movie, where you learn about what normal vampire
culture is like, is the best and most interesting part of the
movie. The rest of it lacks any unifying idea that brings it
weight. The cure is discovered to be controlled sunlight, but no
explanation is given why this would work. The cure turns out to be
contagious, so when a former vampire is fed from the feeder is
cured. There&#8217;s no explanation offered, although I would have liked
some pseudo-science. The rest of the movie is some pretty routine
chase and fight sequences. The movie feels very much like an
allegory about American imperialism and the ethic of kids who join
the military, combined with standard liberal concerns about oil,
etc. The other great missed opportunity is more guilt and attention
given to the main &#8220;bad guy&#8220;&#8216;s interaction with his daughter.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the movie was a disappointment. It wasn&#8217;t totally
terrible; I can definitely think of worse movies. But the majority
of what I got out of it, I would have had by just reading the
Wikipedia page.</p>

exploration stuff. I got the ability to go to other planets and
got to the medieval world. The game is okay so far. I haven&#8217;t
really been captured by it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The combat system
doesn&#8217;t seem as advanced as I&#8217;d like and a lot of the world is
pretty empty and samey. I&#8217;ll keep playing, but I&#8217;m a bit sad I
haven&#8217;t been totally won over by it.</p>

like the commentary that the guy adds and how he seems to know
everything that is interesting in the game. He hasn&#8217;t yet done
what I did in the game, but he&#8217;s done so much more. The game is
super quirky and fascinating.</p>

was the disfigured people, but that&#8217;s weird, mainly because it&#8217;s
actually real.</p>

<p>Looking at the guys in the movie makes you feel tiny, puny, and

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about an hour and a half tonight. I did one adventure
and boss fight, learning a bit more about the world and the alien
races you can interact with. I found the combat to be a bit
weird. When I was controlling Edge, I was finding it very hard to
be successful and dodge attacks. It feels like it should control
more like an action game, but the animations and cool-downs
between the usability of actions are very long, so it feels
strangely sluggish, despite otherwise moving at a pretty fast
pace. I found the amount of health items and the distance to the
&#8220;Inn&#8221; to be pretty grueling. I felt like there were quite a few
times were I was almost going to die because of trying to preserve
healing items. The boss was pretty tough, but I felt like I got
into a nice stride with it. I healed right before I killed it,
because I felt like the battle was going to keep going on for a
long time.</p>

<p>In a small way I&#8217;ve been introduced to something I find very scary
about Star Ocean games: the item invention and harvesting
system. There&#8217;s just so many options to explore, it can be really
overwhelming.</p>

<p>I think doing one &#8220;episode&#8221; per night will be a pretty good rate
for this game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve played the first and third Star Ocean games and really
enjoyed them. I generally like everything that tri-Ace does, so
I&#8217;m looking forward to this game. I like the idea of the enhanced
PS3 version, but I don&#8217;t really know anything about the game or
about what is enhanced about this release.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour in my first session. The concept of the
world is pretty cool. It&#8217;s the first Star Ocean I can think of
that has Earth as a real place. I wonder if it is supposed to be
in the same continuity as the other games? The gameplay seems like
it will be cool. The battle system tutorial was incredibly
complicated and I did during the battle three times before
winning. That makes me hopeful, although a little bit of the time
I felt like I was losing because I couldn&#8217;t target the thing I
wanted. The graphics are pretty good, although the characters are
verrry anime-y and from some angles their clothes really clash
with their faces. (For example, the guy on the computer screen
that Edge talks to.) The controls are responsive.  Although the
camera controls are a little too &#8220;tight&#8221; for my taste so far. I
got a little stuck walking around in the space ship. I think the
problem is that the world is so &#8220;bright&#8221; that it&#8217;s hard to notice
something you can bump into. Anyways, the majority of the time was
spent in videos, so I don&#8217;t really have a good feel for the game
yet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided based on some consultation with forum posts, etc, that I
will watch a long play of the game, rather than play through it
myself. The gameplay is so bad and I want to see everything, but
don&#8217;t want to play with a walkthrough. It&#8217;s more efficient to just
watch it. I found two playthroughs: <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D3368004">a 100% playthrough</a> and [[http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/deadly-premonition/5058/endurance-run-download-urls/417644/][a
GiantBomb Endurance Run]]. I&#8217;m not sure which one will be better, so
I&#8217;ll try a little of both. I intend on writing about the game as I
watch these, as if it were me playing. We&#8217;ll see how that goes&#8230;</p>

it and there was basically no explanation for why. I see why her
character wouldn&#8217;t work for what they had the girl do, but I don&#8217;t

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours today and finished the game. I got
As on the last few missions, which was pretty cool. I think I got
As on almost all of them, but I didn&#8217;t load my Clear data, so I&#8217;m
not sure if it would say what my overall statistics were, etc.</p>

<p>It was a really cool game. The ending was sweet. There were so
pretty crazy revelations about the characters, the events were
suitably epic, and the final boss was intense. I particularly
liked the sequence at the end where they showed what each
character did after the war&#8230; especially the little vignette
about Welkin and Alicia and their baby girl :) So cute!</p>

<p>The combat in the game is really interesting too. I enjoyed both
the &#8220;stealth&#8221; missions and the other ones. It makes me think a lot
about how you&#8217;d make a game like this. (And in particular,
randomly generate levels for it.)</p>

<p>I saw that there were some DLC missions, but I don&#8217;t think it is
worth it for me right now given my queue. I do like the game a
lot, but I feel like I&#8217;ve got the missions down to be a bit rote,
so it&#8217;s mainly the story pushing me to do more.</p>

<p>It was interesting to compare my final in-game timer (25:08) to my
count (33:39), because it shows how much time was taken up by
mission attempts that ultimately failed and thus weren&#8217;t counted
in the real total. Wow!</p>

<p>I highly recommend this game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought this game because I heard so many good things about it on
podcasts, particularly the &#8220;WARNING: A Huge Podcast&#8221;
special. Before playing it, I&#8217;m slightly worried that the gameplay
will be too bad for me to deal with and the M rating will be too
appropriate so I won&#8217;t want to. (I don&#8217;t want to play M games
where you kill humans and where there is really bad language or
nudity. Games like Bayonetta don&#8217;t bother me because there&#8217;s just
inhuman gore, and while it and Vanquish had a few curse words, it
was pretty tame. I almost didn&#8217;t finish Battlefield 3 because of
all the bad language.) Anyways, I bought it pretty cheap, so I&#8217;m
giving it a chance, but if it doesn&#8217;t take me in one night, I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll keep playing it.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I played for about an hour. The world of the game is incredibly
charming. The talking in the car is genius. The realistic scale of
the world is really bizarre, but neat. There are many flourishes
on top of things that other games would have and not really think
about. For example, you can shave in the bathroom, the
conversation over breakfast where the lady couldn&#8217;t hear you
correctly, the strange comments about every person York meets,
it&#8217;s all fascinating and surreal. My wife sat with me and was
entranced by the characters.</p>

<p>The production value is so bad though. The modeling and texture
work has tons of problems and there is severe dead face. The
crying is atrocious. The translation is pretty poor with some
strange too literal phrases. (For example, a gas station is called
as ガソリンスタンド(ga-so-re-n su-ta-n-do, i.e. gasoline stand)
and someone in town tells you where the &#8220;gas stand&#8221; is.)</p>

<p>The game play is bad so far. The walking is really awkward. You
don&#8217;t really have camera control, but can almost turn your head or
something, but it is so fast, it&#8217;s disorienting. The combat is
incredibly boring so far but also really hard to control. The
lock-on is necessary because the reticule movement is so chunky,
but it&#8217;s also not very effective. There&#8217;s not a good system for
keeping you informed of what enemies are around you. Based on
advice from the aforementioned podcasts, I put it on Easy mode to
avoid these. problems.</p>

<p>The quick time events with the ax guy were weird. The driving
instructions were totally over the top. My wife and I looked at
each other aghast when we saw them. It took a long time to get out
of the parking lot and get used to driving with the controls.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strange, surreal game. The fidelity is so bad, I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll be grossed out. I get the impression there will be a
lot of jump scares. I&#8217;m slightly nervous that there will be too
much to do and explore and I&#8217;ll get bogged down and intimidated
doing it. But I&#8217;ll give it more time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a very funny movie. It magnifies standard romantic comedy
cliches to a whole new level and is almost a &#8220;reductio ad absurdum&#8221;
of the concept of a &#8220;Baxter&#8221;. I quite enjoyed it. Michelle Williams
was adorable in it, too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours today, split across watching a
movie. The battles were pretty tough. The once against Selvaria
was insane, because she dodges practically everything. I
eventually realized I should use a unit with the &#8220;Undodgeable
Shot&#8221; ability, then it was all over. The one where you have to
blow up the canyon walls, I kept doing it wrong because I didn&#8217;t
realize there were two things to blow up to force it to
turn. D&#8217;oh. I wasted like 30 minutes because of that.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe that Welkin proposed to Alicia&#8212;he even had a
ring! This game is so grown up compared to other RPGs, especially
Japanese ones. The story is really cool, still.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was the fasted paced and immediately insane movie. It&#8217;s
practically equivalent to the insanity of the fourth Resident Evil
movie. The amount the world of the movies changes in the first five
minutes is unbelievable. Yet, they pack in lots of really
fascinating and sensible ideas and imagery. It&#8217;s spectacular.</p>

<p>The story is interesting, although it is unclear why they would
need to be studying the hybrids, but whatever. The quality of the
Lycan models continues to improve, although their heads are still
not quite right. This movie removes all sympathy for the Lycans
that was in the background of the 1st and 3rd movies. It basically
does absolutely nothing for the mythology either. Perhaps it will
be more successful because of that, because you don&#8217;t really need
to know anything about the previous movies to appreciate this
one. The mythological wankery only appeals to some, but this could
appeal to many.</p>

<p>The movie was noticeably more gory than previous movies. The only
time this bothered me was at the very beginning when Selene was
killing humans escaping. I don&#8217;t mind gore when it is directed at
monsters or aliens, but humans shouldn&#8217;t receive it. It is also
kind of uncharacteristic, because the previous movies have
established a vampire moral code that limits their consumption of
human blood.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Michael Corvin is basically not in the
movie. I was expecting him to come back and save the day in the
final fight after Selene had released him. (The actual ending
though, was supremely feminist, as the mother and daughter don&#8217;t
really need help from the father, or men in general.) But I suppose
it was based on some contractual reason.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page contains story information that I didn&#8217;t get
from the movie. For example, the daughter&#8217;s name is Eve and the
secret of the immortals was revealed to humans by the
doctor. Weird.</p>
