stick so that I know how to. My wife and I talked about trying the
local co-op, but I only have one normal Xbox controller, so she'll
have to use that. Playing with stick feels like it forces me to
move a bit slower and methodically, which is good. I think the
hardest thing to do is run which, again, is a good thing.

I got to the Jungle two times in my little play session and was
able to unlock the short-cut to it.  I read a bit of a FAQ about
the achievements and they are very intimidating. I feel like I
will just want to beat it normally. I'm not sure if I should try
to play through it from the start always or use the
short-cuts. The short-cuts are a nice way to feel like you're
making progress definitely, but it also seems like you are denying
yourself the ability to gather resources from the early stages.

I like using the Compass and bombs to get to the bottom quickly.

--

In the evening, I played for about 45 minutes, most of the time
with my wife. We found playing two player to be very
frustrating. The game requires a lot of coordination and it is
easy to make a mistake that totally disrupts the other
player---particularly because the camera follows the first
player. For example, if you accidentally fall or get shot, you
are likely to force scroll the screen and kill them. Not a recipe
for marital bliss.

that much about the world of Fez, but it was cute. I translated a
sign that said: "Trapped in a Fez factory, please send help."
Turning the skulls was funny, because I could've done it so early
but didn't realize about grabbing things yet. I got four crashes
total in the game, I think. The 64-cube ending was neat and kind
of the opposite of the other one: zoom out vs zoom in.

Overall, I enjoyed the game. The puzzles were pleasant and the
weird deciphering stuff was unique. I ended up needing 3 pages of
notes and it was fun to make them.

I like the concept of roguelikes and I like games that are
primarily skill based. I like the idea of this game a lot, but I
haven't got the point where I love it.

I think the running speed is a little too fast and I haven't
gotten used to it yet. I get the impression that the way to play
this game and succeed is to go incredibly slowly and calculate
every risk. At this point I feel like that won't be a very fun way
to play, because in platformers I love the feeling of running and
having flow.

discoveries. I discovered the Tetromino code and got the Telescope
worked out. I was also able to use one of the pillars and do the
door room. Finding the Tetris code was awesome because there was
so much I could do with it. Just before I finished that session, I
found the Rosetta Stone of the alphabet... although so far I
haven't found any useful text.

Later in the day I played again and found the number code and then
got to the ancient city. (I had been exploring the world and never
going to back to the waterfall area.) Something funny happened, I
had already got 32 cubes before getting to the city and Dot said
something about going back to a door there. I explored it and
inadvertently beat the game. I was nervous when I saw New Game+,
because I didn't want to get everything again, but was glad that I
just got the sunglasses.

I played for another two hours and got a lot more, including the
many Tuning Forks. Right now I have just got through the Lava
area... which was terrifying. I don't have another key to use in
the Sewer, so I'm nervous that I'll to find my way back here.

I've continued to find the platforming to be fun and the puzzley
aspects of the game to be nice. I think the alphabet is a bit
over-kill because it is just so painful to translate anything. I'd
much prefer giving proof that I know what it means and then having
the game auto-translate or something.

I got about 10
cubes and a bunch of bits. I like the game so far. The platforming
is fine and the environmental puzzles are not too tricky, but
interesting enough. I though the opening was very clever and the
concept is cute. I get the feeling that I will become annoyed with
the inability to travel quickly between places I've been before
and the inability to refer to locations by name. The map, since it
is a non-planar graph, is very confusing and not very helpful.

I have taken some notes of the signs I see, but haven't gotten at
all close to deciphering anything.

--

I played for another two and a half hours tonight. I have over
twenty normal cubes and I got three anti-cubes: the first from the
QR code and the other two from around the clock. The platforming
has gotten more challenging and interesting. I quite like that the
map shows when there is a "secret" somewhere you have not
completed.

In the creepy area, there was this set of doors that seemed to be
confusingly placed. I mapped everything out but didn't get
anywhere. Later, I realized that I had treasure maps on me that
showed some stuff related to that area, but it also had symbols I
haven't figured out yet.

The area near the clock is interesting because it feels like a
place where other dimensional shifters lived. I feel like I'll
have to go back there a lot.

Still annoyed at the lack of fast travel. Also, the game crashed
once. Lame. I would have stopped playing if I lost anything, but
didn't, so that's good.

It's also pretty amazing to me that only 9% of my play time was
fighting this time, especially because I skipped every cut-scene,
had 2x movement speed, and was just running from boss to boss.

I've decided that I'm done with the game. The only things left
that I could do is (a) get all the Carta cards, which would be
super tedious; (b) get the Turtlez Togz from the Dark Turtlez,
which would be super tedious; (c) get the Eleth Mixer to 9999,
which even checking out what apparently is the fastest way to do
it, would be crazy; and, (d) get the title trophies for the men,
which would probably be painful because it mean having lots of
battles and managing what skills they used.

This was a very fun game. The battle system is great and the story
is a lot of fun. The world is cool too. I think my only complaints
about it are very minor: the user interface on some things could
have been better. For example, being able to have sets of AI
settings for different situations, sets of mixer settings as well,
and being able to pick a result you wanted from the dualizing
system (that you had already discovered) rather than having to
remember the recipe in your head. The AI was also pretty
unreliable as a healer. I found that it almost never tried to
resurrect dead characters and if you told it to, then it was hit,
it would not remember what your last instruction was. This was
very annoying.

The
total time to win was 6 hours and 12 minutes. Something amazing
happened, I had the various spheres on the mixer the entire time
and finally got 1 Darkened Ore in the last hour of gameplay and an
Enasphere in literally the walk up to where you fight the last
boss (so I had to turn around, save, and get it made into Asbel's
best sword.) I beat Lambda in 60 seconds, as well. Nice!

Next, I fought Lambda again on Chaos and used the Cheria piggyback
trick. The key was to get hurt by a ranged attack and beforehand
get rid of his Nova barrier right away with a quick spell.

After doing that, I played for another two hours-ish and got to
the Lastalia Core in the Future arc. In the evening I played for
another 30 minutes and beat the game... killing the Fodra Queen
in 60 seconds (actually 24) on the first try. Nice!

After doing the future arc, my grade is now 3551.

My next goal is the Platinum PSN trophy... the only barriers are
titles for the men and a 9999 mixer... which all seem pretty
painful to get. I'm going to look into the details tomorrow and
decide if I will do it. I'll also look up my battle stats for the
New Game+, I think that will be interesting.

I'm rushing
very quickly through the game (I still have not bought any
equipment) and I'm up to just before the boss of Fendel Tower. I
have set all the ultimate weapon spheres in the mixer, but haven't
got any yet, which is definitely disappointing. I'm using all the
men (plus Cheria) in my group to try to get their titles. It's
fun. It's very strangely challenging because at 10x damage, you
basically can never get hurt or it will always be a one-hit
kill. I'm beginning to think I will beat it again super fast.

of the first Bourne movie (maybe even too much) by having a

names of programs, but they are too quickly described that you
lose track of them very fast. I think it assumes too much

the stuff I wanted to. I played through Floor 10 of Zhonecage two
more times and got the Darkened Ore and then I finished the Katz
Korner Inn Requests and fought the Gentleman. He was a bit of a
let down as the last boss I fought, because he was so easy. 

Before I closed out my save, I backed it up and then sold
everything to max out my stamps (although I wasn't able to get
all 10 everywhere.) I bought some pretty good stuff in the Grade
Shop for New Game+. Here were my stats for the game:

Asbel's Level: 113
Encounters: 2028
Max Combo: 278
Enemies Seen: 99.3%
Items Seen: 96.5%
Skits: 82.3%
Battle Time: 23:47
Grade: 3119

I think it is interesting that while I played for about 107 hours,
I was only in battle for about 24 of those, or about 22% of the
game time. My average battle length was 42 seconds, which is
interesting given that I had some pretty long battles too.

I immediately started a new game and played for an hour and a
half. I have been doing most of it on Chaos difficulty, but at
this point where I can't bring people back to life, it is very
difficult with the 10x damage and 2x critical, so I dropped it to
Evil for a bit. After an hour a half, I got to Level 28 and am
just before getting Richard back as adults... which is crazy. I'm
obviously skipping every scene, I know exactly where to go, and I
have 2x movement speed.

Game 2: 1:26 @ 20:42 - Level 28
10x damage is /really/ hard on Chaos and pretty hard on Evil

I completed Zhonecage and did almost all the Inn requests by
grinding shards in Zhonecage. The only things left are to do that
last Katz Korner requests, fight the Gentlemen, then fight Lambda
Theos. I checked and my grade is now 2907. I just need a little
bit more so I can get the best carry-overs. Some carry-overs don't
seem very useful, such as half of my money or the battle items,
because with so much more gald per battle, I don't think I'll
really need it. Plus I only have about 300k in the bank because of
dualizing. (Although perhaps the best thing to do is sell
everything before you New Game+?)

In the evening I played for another hour and a half-ish. I beat
Lambda Theos and got a few more of the Katz requests. I tried
Zhonecage 10 again so I could get the Darkened Ore and didn't get
it. Very frustrating. I'm nearing the end.

I made some
more attempts to gather stuff in the process of dualizing for
floor 10. I decided to clear the game on the other difficulties. I
did Moderate and Evil. I haven't done the 60 seconds or the Chaos
difficulty though. I'm not confident I can. Also, I decided to
check my grade: 2719. I can get basically everything except
Skills and x3 SP.

In the afternoon, I played for about an hour and decided to try
and farm shards in Zhonecage for the kinds of shards I needed for
the inn requests. This was very successful.


In the evening, I continued that for about an hour.  I think there
are only two or three more requests I need to do. I also think
there's just one more upgrade before I can hit floor 10.
