all. The two kind of levels was a really neat touch that I
enjoyed.

second side-scrolling stage. There was a lot of neat stuff going
on in the game. I liked the "set piece" moments and I though the
top-down stages were neat.

On one level, this game is a lot like a shmup, so you'd think that
I would like it a lot, but I didn't. I think the reason I didn't
was that the character was very hard to maneuver, so you felt like
it wasn't your fault you were dying. When I finally died, I had to
fight a boss while clinging to the side of a wall and it felt very
unfair, like I couldn't do anything about it.

I'm sure if my first console were a SNES, I would have loved this
game as much as I loved Contra I, but this didn't do it for me.

do. The game is a lot slower paced in the combat than River City
Ransom, so it wasn't as exciting. I read online that they dropped
the shopping part and it is more like an open-world beat-em up
with RPG-style levels, rather than choives in what you learn,
etc. It doesn't sound as exciting.

Overall, I found the game to be very fun and cute. I would
definitely recommend it for the good mechanics and the nice
story. The story and mechanics, however, don't feel good enough to
me to warrant many replays, so I don't think I will play it
again. But I definitely will think of it fondly.

I'm excited to see what connections future Quintet games will have
to this world.

more to do once I can damage metal enemies.

The game is very cute and there's a lot more connections and
similarities to Actraiser. It's like you're a different avatar of
"The Master". You move around to different towns to restore. There
was even a kid named Teddy! (That's the name of a kid from
Bloodpool in Actraiser.) I really enjoyed the second area, because
it was a town of animals. In both of the first two areas, you also
go into the dreams of a plant :) It was neat too when an old man
says he's was lonely when his wife died but then got a goat to
take care of; when you talk to the goat, it says it's the wife
reincarnated and even though she can't talk to her husband, she's
glad to be around him. Cute.

The combat is getting a little more complex as there are more
enemies that shoot projectiles, etc. But it's not incredibly
complicated, because the controls are so stiff and tile-based.

game in Nintendo Power and being incredibly impressed by the
visuals. Now that I am older and playing it, it feels like the
visuals are the main reason for this game being terrible. The
sprites are too big for the action and the hit boxes are real
bad. Amazingly, it is a 2D platformer with camera problems. When
you die, if you move to the right, then the screen doesn't scroll
with your ghost. This made it so I couldn't see the next platform,
I had to go backwards then right again to get it to
scroll. There's really nothing special about this game at all.

Although my Japanese is good enough to
understand all the words on the interface, I couldn't get anything
out of the story. The mechanics of the game are very confusing
(like most Saga games I've played) and not particularly appealing.

The row system is a little neat and there's clearly a lot of
freedom. The ability to see the hordes of monsters on the screen
is interesting. But... I won't play it.

time. I've played Illusion of Gaia before and it's a lot like
it. It's a traditional action RPG, but there are something neat
things about it.

In the story/structure, it is very similar to Quintet's Actraiser
(which I just played), in that as you fight monsters, you
"restore" lost parts of the towns and unlock people who were
captive and now tell you about their lives. I've enjoyed the
reveals so far. My favorite was a goat that, after giving you a
hint, said, "I have other things to attend to now", and then
walked off.

In the battle mechanics, it's also like Actraiser in that there
are monster spawn points that release one monster after
another. The difference, though, is that here you just have to
kill a certain number and then the spawn point is sealed. Since
you know where they are going to spawn, there's a temptation to
sit on top of it and spam the attack, but they thought of that and
the enemies are invulnerable when they first appear, but they can
still hurt you. Instead, you have to stand a little bit of a way
back and spam the attack button. =) I haven't gotten to a place
where the combat is tricky, but it does feel good, and that counts
for a lot.

I'll definitely keep playing this.

on the NES. I love the Rogue-like "hunger" system. It's very
unique.

This game was incredibly similar to those games, although with a
lot more of a slow pace. In the NES game, you seem to almost
always have a skateboard, so it's more like a modern "runner" in
that you just control the jumping (and shooting.) I found this one
to be much more deliberate and that it emphasized using the
weapons against the enemies more, whereas that seemed to be more
of a bonus in the earlier game.

Like a lot of early SNES games I've been playing, I feel like
they got drunk on giant sprites and didn't polish the tightness
and feel of the game enough. I'm excited about the next game
though, because I hear it is drastically different.

I got to 3-3 on my first
continue. 

This game is a lot worse than the NES Castlevania games and it is
nowhere close to Dracula X. I think the biggest problem is the
really stiff transitions between states. You can very clear see
the game stutter when you jump, start swinging, get on a ladder,
etc. Unlike the first game, where the deliberateness of the game
seems to be a purposeful feature... in this game it seems like a
bad mistake.

In addition, I agree with the Sequelitis estimation of the
negative aspects of the eight-way whip: the combat sequences are
simply easy. I barely got hit a single time and the only times I
died, it was because of falling during platforming (primarily
during swinging segments.)
