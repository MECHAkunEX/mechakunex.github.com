overworld. 

The extent to which this is a knock-off of Zelda cannot be
overstated. It is very clearly intended to be the same. I feel
like the SMS colors are a bit brighter and nicer, but with less
variety overall. The main character looks like Rocket Knight, and
kind of weird to me.

In terms of game play, it's fine, but not very special. I found
that the movement was a lot smoother than in Zelda, but that this
was a little problematic because it felt like you "slid" up to
enemies and couldn't stop in front of them. The first boss fight
wasn't very tough and it was much easier in general than Zelda
because the enemies didn't seem to respawn when you died and
continued.

Under the philosophy of only playing amazing games, I decided not
to continue, although I can appreciate that it seems like a
perfectly passable game.

pieces and at the "Bro" level.

This game is so bizarre and iconic for me. I had it when I was a
kid. So much of the theming is utterly ridiculous and "90s"
today. For instance, I love that all veggies do damage to you and
how off kilter the enemies are: like the Opera lady or the band of
chickens. The people who help you, like Santa and the Carrot guy,
are so funny too.

Overall, I find the gameplay to pretty boring though. It
definitely is low key and lets you "chill" while playing, but it
also lacks any real excitement. Nevertheless, it is very cool that
it is a roguelike: random maps, random treasures, hunger,
etc. Bizarre.

the end of the first tower mission. The combat continues to be fun
and I feel like I'm combo-ing better than before. I like all the
dorky one-liners and come-backs that Dante has. The fists are very
fun. I got to the first Secret Mission I couldn't complete... the
one where you have to be in certain rings to hurt the enemies.

so many missiles and I ran out. I had to go back to Area 6 and get
a refresh... I wonder if I'll still make the 5 hours deadline? I'm
nervous about the ending area, because the Head-hugger Metroids
are always such a pain in Metroid games.

--

Later in the day I played for about thirty minutes and beat it. I
first waltzed to the Queen Metroid and was destroyed. The
Head-huggers weren't hard. But the Queen was. So I restarted and
used a Save state (my first in the game) outside the Queen's
chamber. I eventually beat it on my sixth or seventh try after
that using the Stomach technique. It was fun. My final time was
03:20, which means I spent about 1:09 on wasted runs.

I'd say that this is a good game, but not as amazing as other
ones.

that this was the first one in the series. When I started playing
though, I was very surprised with how similar things are: the
Gemma Knights, all the enemies are similar, and the store keepers
are dancing guys. It is also interesting to see the connection to
Final Fantasy: the hero sprite is clearly adapted from the Final
Fantasy 1 Fighter.

I found the translation to be pretty horrific, but in a charming
way. I died on my way back from getting the Mattock and I hadn't
yet saved... I think. I never got a dialogue to save and when I
got back to the title screen and tried to Continue, my finger
slipped and I pressed New Game. (Maybe the problem was with the
emulator, because I also had trouble moving the cursor around to
just where I wanted.)

It was pretty annoying for that to happen, but I'm not too torn
up. I think it's unlikely that I will complete the game. There's
something about Gameboy graphics on my big TV that makes my head
hurt, plus I know that 'Sword of Mana' on the GBA is a remake of
this, and presumably better.

wouldn't say I really enjoyed the combat though... it was very
basic because each character generally could only do one
thing. The only choice you were making was based on whether you
thought you could finish a group with a certain character and thus
should target a different one with the next person. I can imagine
enjoying taking this on during a long road trip as a kid... but
it's a goner today.

Metroid 2. When I heard that the sequel to the great Metroid was
on the GB, I was very surprised. Now that I'm older, I realize it
has to do with the designers of the Gameboy and the designers of
Metroid being the same people.

In any case, this game definitely feels like Metroid. Even though
it has smaller, discrete "levels", the areas are big enough to
have multiple paths and require thinking about how you're going to
go through them.

I got up to the Save Point in Area 2. At this point, the greatest
take-away on the game is that the Spider Ball is very unintuitive
to use, because you don't need to change the direction you push as
the balls moves, until you stop moving and try to restart. The
other thing is that the gameplay doesn't feel as "cramped" as the
screen is. It's clear that it has been designed to never put
anything too far away so that you won't see it. Very well
designed.

I will beat this. (Although I'm super stuck at the moment... I
have very little health and can't find a place to heal up.)

I was
always a SNES player, even though I had a Genesis, I found it to
be pretty lacking on good games. I think we got it because of the
advertising, but quickly found that the SNES would be better. In
any case, I've never played any of the Phantasy Star games, but
I've naturally heard a lot of good things about them because
people seem to like them.

I am sure that I would feel a little differently about this game
if I played it when it was released, but I found it completely
intolerable: the shop interface was horrific (doesn't tell you
what is good or let you equip it), the combat was painful (ugly,
the sound effects were awful, and it was just slow), etc.

Compared to other early RPGs around this time, like DQ4 or even
FF4, it's ridiculously bad. Ugh.

In any case, I bought a hat and went outside looking for the bio
lab. I got in three fights and used the available attacks and
died. I guess I should have done some grinding to get strong
enough to explore... but if that's the case then I'm definitely
not interested in playing through this.

The short dialogue scene I saw was kind of neat. It was cool that
everything was "first person" in the description.

but still was not moved.

The graphics were a lot better right away, but the slow movement
was still there. The theming of the castle was pretty bad... big
empty rooms, nothing to suggest it is a "throne room" and the
opening sequence was pretty bold in its simplicity.

The menu interface was pretty novel with the response message
being displayed in place. It was kind of neat, but ultimately
pretty painful. The equipping interface was particularly painful.

It took a very long time to figure out how I was supposed to
save. I guessed that it would happened when I went to the inn and
it felt a little weird to start fighting before I saved, but I did
so I wouldn't waste the money.

The battle music was so bad and the interface was very
confusing. Once I realized what the things meant it was pretty
smooth, at least until I wanted to pick my actions
individually. Then it was real bad, because when you want to do
something non-automatic the sequence is: Manual &gt; *REDACTED*acter &gt;
Confirm? &gt; Selection &gt; Target &gt; Auto. Ouch.

I wandered around, found two towns and a cave, but then died
without any clue what I was supposed to do next.

I can't imagine playing through it because it felt so tedious in
so many ways.

anything about it. It's basically a Japanese first-person dungeon
crawler. The anime scene introducing the story was cute, as is the
interface of walking around the town and talking to people. Once
you're in the dungeon... it is a first-person dungeon crawl with
no map.

It's clear how you would beat the game: build your own map and
meticulously track where you are in it. I am way too old to do
that. Maybe if I wrote a program to build the map for me, I would
consider it, but I can't imagine actually having a piece of graph
paper in front of me. The biggest pain is not just having the map
but keeping track of where you are on it while you're playing. I
glanced at a map of the first level online but realized it was
useless.

The shop interface has the classic problem of not knowing if an
item is better and not allowing you to equip it. What a pain.

The combat is very straight forward with only one choice at any
time. I expect that you get more people and can cast spells, but
it doesn't feel like the combat will be very compelling.

Overall, that means it's a drop.

missions. This game is *awesome*. The combat system flows really
well and the Demon/Angel weapon system is a very cool way to do
it. I'm very excited about using the pull towards/pull to system
during combat. I love it when an ability is useful in traversal
and combat---the best things in Metroidvanias is when the
abilities aren't just "keys", but have many uses.

The style of the game is really neat. I like that everything isn't
static and seems to be alive and reacting to you. The words that
appear all over the scenery when you get attacked is super cool
too. The opening of the game was particularly ridiculous.  It's a
bit disappointing that Dante's motivation is just "My mom was
killed", which is a classic "Women in the Fridge" plot-line.

I don't like how much vulgarity there is in the game though. It
makes me feel like I can't play it as much, because I normally
play games around my little kids. I guess I'll have to keep it for
when they're asleep.

I was so impressed with my first two hours with the game, I feel
like I want to do everything possible in the game and play all the
difficulty levels. We'll see how I feel after I beat it once
though :) I was a little nervous when I started though, because I
wasn't super impressed with the previous game and had never played
a Ninja Theory game, but I was still interested from the Giantbomb
Quick Look and discussion I'd heard.
