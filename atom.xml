    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror&#8217;s
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.</p>

<p>The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can&#8217;t believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;d at least run into her
before.</p>

start again today. So far, the story is very intriguing and the

to interesting puzzles, though.</p>

jokes that they have and the general wackiness of the action. I
think you need to be a little bit older to appreciate it though, so
we didn&#8217;t watch it with the kids.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I&#8217;m in an area
now with just one person in my group and it&#8217;s quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I&#8217;m
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It&#8217;s not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven&#8217;t
died since I restarted.</p>

<p>I made it through a bunch more areas (I&#8217;m about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don&#8217;t know.) It&#8217;s almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don&#8217;t see
the global path so you don&#8217;t get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn&#8217;t find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
&#8220;side&#8221; quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places&#8230; kind
of a hole&#8230; that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren&#8217;t totally showing, it gets a little real and that&#8217;s
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting&#8230; the concept of remnants is neat. They&#8217;re basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I&#8217;m just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don&#8217;t understand how to optimize it,
so I&#8217;m just getting by.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Based on my last experience with the game, I think I&#8217;m basically
done with the game. I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play&#8212;5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren&#8217;t tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don&#8217;t think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I&#8217;m doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn&#8217;t quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can&#8217;t remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn&#8217;t noticed because I hadn&#8217;t play SMB
yet.</p>

nearly as good as Deathsmiles, ESPgaluda II, or Mushihime-sama

lack the insane music and really popping/flowing feel of the other
games. I think I might play MMP every once in a while to
experience it a little bit, but it&#8217;s not something I love at
all. Overall, a bit of a bad purchase, seeing as I brought it back
from Japan myself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I just played for 1:15. I got to the end of the fourth area,
but died during the boss fight. I had not saved&#8212;I don&#8217;t know
why, I guess I assumed that there would be checkpoints before
bosses, like Blue Dragon (and many of the other RPGs I&#8217;ve played
recently have.) And so, I lost all that progress and I will have
to start again from scratch. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear doing it
all over again I don&#8217;t think. At least not right away, I&#8217;ll try
again tomorrow, I guess.</p>

<p>With my limited play experience, I have some thoughts about the
game.</p>

<p>First, the technical problems are super apparent. The texture
pop-in is really obvious and pretty bad. The framerate is pretty
chuggy. There is a fairly long loading screen before every fight
and between every scene (even with it installed.) In my short
time, this wasn&#8217;t unbearable, but it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Second, the art is very pretty. They put a lot of work into most
of the textures and models. The animation is pretty basic. A lot
of the cut-scenes look really blocky and there is pretty bad &#8220;dead
eye&#8221; syndrome. This is definitely not FF13. The liquid effects in
the first cave weren&#8217;t great and there was an early scene with an
overhead view of a field where there was some pretty bad
tiling. But overall, pretty.</p>

<p>Third, the gameplay is totally overwhelming. The very first combat
sequence you get into is filed with tons of HUD elements. The
weapon/customization/etc system looks very frightening. This is
overall a good thing. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t a tedious tutorial
(although the first few areas are clearly about teaching you
different tactics.) The details of combat are really strange. A
cross between doing a lot and doing nothing.</p>

<p>On one level, it is a strategy game where you have teams on 2D
field and you direct attacks to set up flanks, back attacks,
etc. Except, you can&#8217;t actually move the units, they run in a
straight line at the enemy unit you choose. So it&#8217;s a strategy
game where positioning isn&#8217;t directly controlled. This feels like
doing nothing, compared to a strategy game, but like doing a lot
compared to a normal RPG.</p>

<p>On another level, it&#8217;s kind of like a normal Dragon Quest style
RPG where you select &#8220;Attack&#8221;, &#8220;Magic&#8221;, or &#8220;Item&#8221; and then watch
the action play out. Except that the animations are much more
involved, and there are little QTEs (slightly more complicated
than Lost Odyssey&#8217;s) sometimes during them. Except that you don&#8217;t
choose these actions on per character basis, but for a whole team
(called a union of units.) Except that you don&#8217;t actually choose
which skills you will use, like &#8220;Magic > Fire&#8221;, you just choose
&#8220;Magic&#8221;. Except that all your skills aren&#8217;t always available, for
example, you can only choose &#8220;Heal&#8221; when someone is actually hurt
and within range. This feels like doing nothing, compared to a
normal RPG, or even S/TRPG, but a lot more than an RTS or
something where you just point and they do their one thing.</p>

<p>It is really strange.</p>

<p>Obviously I just died during this fight, which means I haven&#8217;t
learned it enough. My problem in the fight was over-confidence and
not healing. But, that over-confidence came from just spamming
Attack in all the other battles (&#8220;Press A to Win&#8221;-style). Tomorrow
I&#8217;ll see how fast I can get back to this point by skipping scenes,
etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I plan on starting this game today. I thought I&#8217;d write about my
expectations before I played it.</p>

<p>Like Blue Dragon, I&#8217;d heard of and vaguely followed this game
before it came out. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;next gen&#8221; games that
Square produced, so I thought that it might be cool. I&#8217;ve heard
that it has a very strange combat system. Most people who say this
mean it as a bad thing, but that sounds like a plus to me. I don&#8217;t
really know anything about the story, but from what I do know it
sounds pretty different, which sounds like it could be good. I&#8217;ve
heard there are technical problems with laggyness and pop-in, but
that some of them go away if you install to the HDD. The laggyness
could be killer for me, but I don&#8217;t really care about stuff like
pop-in, especially in slow paced games like RPGs.</p>

<p>I looked on HowLongToBeat and there are 6 playthroughs, all over
100 hours. That makes me nervous, because I&#8217;m skeptical of loving
the game that much and it suggests to me that it could be really
grind heavy, which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m pretty excited about seeing what it is like.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the game&#8230; meaning the final
optional dungeon and final dungeon tonight. I started to notice a
lot of chunky frame rate moments, strangely.</p>

<p>The end of the game was satisfying in a lot of ways. I got to the
power level where there was a lot of flexibility and fun in
planning the skill combinations, so I could create brutal
combos. The story wrapped up in a fun way too, with a few good
twists there at the end. The final bosses were not very hard
though.</p>

<p>Overall, I found the game on par. It wasn&#8217;t particularly special:
the combat system was simple, the story was okay, and the skill
system didn&#8217;t really flourish until the end. But, there also
wasn&#8217;t anything really bad about it. The worst thing was probably
the plainness and the fact that a lot of the dungeons were very
samey because of small prop counts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the game to anymore, because there
are much better options. But obviously I didn&#8217;t dislike it enough
to quit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I did a few more sidequests, including the Sea
Cube. During that I got a lot of class upgrades and had fun
picking out skill configurations. These side bosses are pretty
tough. There&#8217;s one (the Ghost Yeet) that I can&#8217;t survive more than
a round against.</p>

<p>The Devee Dance of Love was pretty funny. Stonesaurus is very
hard, but eventually I just used a strong Guard shadow and got
him. The boss music vocal track gets really old.</p>

<p>Before bed I wanted to finish a podcast, so I did a tiny bit of SP
grinding in the Underground River against the Kelolons.</p>

<p>I hope to do the last sidequest tomorrow night and finish that
night or the next.</p>

definitely not exciting. It was well acted. A lot of the movie went
on too long. The battle scenes are very long and drag without much
interesting stuff going on. Additionally, there are a few
&#8220;psychedelic&#8221; scenes that really date the movie. All that aside, I
think it was pretty cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I finished getting As or above on every event in Pac-Man CE
DX. My ranking across the whole game is 5,100/245,281 or in the
top 2.07%. It&#8217;s a really fun game. I think I like the normal mode
the most. The time trial is fun, but I think it&#8217;s too easy to
cheese out and ignore the ghosts and just take shortcuts, so it
eliminates a bit of the unique fun of CE-DX. Such an awesome game.</p>

on her first try at &#8220;Hole in One&#8221; (although she did watch me be
terrible at it for about 5 minutes.) Very fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The story took a bit of a depressing turn today. But it was a good
moment for the characters to come back from. Nothing particularly
exciting in the game happened though. I&#8217;m now at the part of the
game where it is possible to go to the final dungeon, but probably
not a good idea because I would be too weak. There are clearly a
lot of potential side-quests (the yellow stars on the map) that I
can go check out. I&#8217;ll do a few.</p>

<p>The battling of the shadows, plus their ability to materialize for
super attacks that you ride on them during is very reminiscent of
the Eidolons in FF13. Weird.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours tonight, although on the clock it
was only three. Since I was in Nene&#8217;s fortress, I had a time limit
on myself and I pushed myself forward pretty fast. When I got to
the four robot boss fight&#8230; wow it was really hard. I probably
died 4 times. I was worried that I would have to quit the game
because when I fought around the area I was in, there were only a
few enemies and then there was no more AND I had a time limit. I
gave one more try and beat them just before I planned on giving
up. It was a frightening and annoying thought to have to quit,
although I don&#8217;t think I would have really minded too
much&#8230; unfortunately. I looked at a FAQ for fight advice and it
suggested that I be at level 42&#8230; which I definitely am not.</p>

<p>As I play this game more, I&#8217;m liking Maru more and more. He&#8217;s so
wacky and funny. Zola looks more and more like a tramp with every
day and her ridiculous headband is soooo <em>Snow</em>. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the final cut-scenes of the disc, Nene&#8217;s mouth animations look
really weird and Nene is more and more of a jerk. Wow. What a
punk. He&#8217;s not as pure evil on screen as Kefka was in FF6, but he
has the same quality where you just hate him. Shu is, of course,
super tough. I wonder where the game will go now the characters
have lost their magic (except for Shu)? Obviously they&#8217;ll get them
back and save the day&#8230; but how?</p>

<p>Disc 2 was significantly short than Disc 1. 13.5 vs
about 7. Almost half as short.</p>
