    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this for a while tonight and destroyed it. I&#8217;ve played
this many many times with other people&#8230; like my friends when I
was young, my brother, my wife, my dad, etc. But I&#8217;ve never
actually beat it, perhaps because we could never have the patience
and time to actually go through the whole thing. This time, it
was pretty simple to do. I just got Dragon Feet, and lined myself
up to hit the bosses after they were downed. The main problem is
the twins and the random hit you get on you as you&#8217;re traveling
through the map. The game play mechanics in this game feel really
really good, but it&#8217;s really broken because you can abuse it so
much. I&#8217;ll definitely play this in the future in co-op, but I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strong enough to last on its own&#8230; but then
again, it&#8217;s has a fun flow to it; like I can just roll through a
few levels of Mega Man 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been about a month since I&#8217;ve played this game and I&#8217;m not
really interested in trying it again. It&#8217;s a cute concept and the
world is pretty interesting, but the controls and gameplay just
aren&#8217;t compelling enough to last much longer than I&#8217;ve
played. It&#8217;s too imprecise and the touch controls are
obnoxious. I almost feel like if this game were on PS3 I would
enjoy it a lot more. It also has a Portal-esque quality to it in
the way you move around (there aren&#8217;t gravity puzzles, as far as
I&#8217;ve seen.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played tonight for two and half hours. I found it unbearable. I
couldn&#8217;t find any codes, so I decided to use the exploits with
canceling commands. That was actually a bad idea because it meant
I couldn&#8217;t effectively do the &#8220;hit yourself&#8221; trick to get HP and
MP. The next big problem was that I couldn&#8217;t do that because I
didn&#8217;t have enough money to pay for the inn to heal after I used
all my MP. The thing that is so annoying about this game is that
you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re getting anything from battles. At
least in Dragon Quest, you are making progress. In this, I feel
like I was either cheating or wasting my time. In the average
random battle, I would barely make 10 GP, but I needed around 100
to 200 to use the inn and then over 400 to pay for a spell. I&#8217;m
curious about the story, but I&#8217;ll have to play one of the
re-releases that put in a traditional experience system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played today and gave it another chance. This time, it was a
total breeze. I did die in the Amazon after spending $300k, which
was really painful, but I realized that if you just hold bounce
next to the statue, guys come and die under you without a chance
of getting hurt. This was totally boring and stupid (it took
a few minutes), but it wasn&#8217;t horrific. After that, there was no
more grinding. The whole game was really short&#8230; just about an
hour from start to finish. The best part was the unique challenge
of not being able to directly jump on enemies and the way you
sometimes needed to whack things with your cane. (For example,
the mummy ducks in the mansion where fun to fight when you had to
whack their ball &amp; chain.)</p>

<p>Overall, the game was fun&#8230; good music, cute monsters&#8230; and
it&#8217;s classic in a certain sense, but I don&#8217;t feel it is worth
replaying, because it is sooo easy.</p>

still think the core gameplay is really sloppy&#8212;the hit boxes
are bad, the shot control isn&#8217;t great, and the interface is
pretty whack. But, I can see why some people might have loved it
when it was released. I&#8217;m done with it though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another night of 5-19X. This level makes me hate the game.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is great when (a) a level has really good flow and
(b) the challenges are bite-sized, so that when you fail you don&#8217;t
have to repeat long sequences of difficulty stuff.</p>

<p>Normal games can&#8217;t be as hard as Super Meat Boy because they are
committed to long levels and don&#8217;t give instant, infinite
respawns.</p>

<p>This level (and a few other levels) totally break the design of
the game. There are basically 5 totally independent challenges
that have nothing to do with one another and almost all of the
require you to stop moving and dodge, rather than having a flow
from one thing to the next.</p>

<p>(My point here is that a reductive
view of this issue would say that every jump is a unique
challenge. The difference is that running down a hallway in SMB is
a single coherent challenge because you must have the right flow
and tempo.)</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy is a great game when it is fulfilling its design
goals, but when it forgets them&#8230; it is horrifically bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played and beat this tonight. Last time I played, I could barely
get past the first level because it is so brutal and you need to
grind, but it&#8217;s practically impossible. This time, I tried to use
a code that gave more hearts per heart icon you got, but it didn&#8217;t
really help. I used a password that gave me more levels and that
made a big difference. The hardest part of the game was the third
fortress, because it was so complex of a labyrinth. It&#8217;s a fun
game&#8230; a little too floaty jumps and the inability to scroll
backward is bit rough, but for an old game it has pretty decent
mechanics. Although it is a classic in my memory, it&#8217;s systems
don&#8217;t live up to being a real classic.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw this movie advertised at the beginning of another and it
seemed pretty neat. The mythology of the Green Lantern world is
pretty cool (based on my knowledge from the live action movie) so
we decided to get it on Netflix. It was pretty bad. The plot is so
weak and most of the stories are tiny facades around a big fight
scene. The fight scenes aren&#8217;t even that interesting, because the
rings are just used as laser cannons. One of the coolest things
about the Green Lanterns is their ability to make anything with
the ring, but that wasn&#8217;t utilized very well. Overall, this was a
very disappointing movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I saw this tonight [which is why I wanted to write down
my thoughts about the other ones.] I found a lot about this movie a
lot better than QoS. I thought the movie was paced a lot better and
the new characters were quite interesting. On the other hand, there
wasn&#8217;t really an deep connections. Even the deepest connection
(between M and 007) wasn&#8217;t developed much. In addition, the goal of
the villain wasn&#8217;t at a very big scale. He was almost Bane or
Joker-ish in his abilities, but had a trivial revenge scheme
planned. There were lots of holes and missed opportunities&#8212;why
not just blow up MI6 when M was there if he wanted to kill her so
bad? Why was Severine with the guy getting killed? Why would
Patrice be necessarily working for the same guy twice? Severine&#8217;s
death was totally ignored and Bond doesn&#8217;t even acknowledge it
happens. The island is a wasted set. The best parts are the
committee hearing and the showdown at Skyfall.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a much more traditional Bond movie, with a ridiculous and
large scale evil plot. I felt like the feel of the movie was a lot
different and that the beginning is much better and tighter than
the end. There are lots of bombshells in the movie, but they dwell
on Bond&#8217;s ability to conquest a bit less.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun caper movie. The story is very complicated and has
lots of twists, in a way that reminiscent of Ocean&#8217;s Eleven, but
with more off-the-wall occurrences. I feel like there were a lot
of things that should have been explained, because they would have
been very interesting, that weren&#8217;t. For example, how Penelope
manages to get out of Prague. In general though, after about the
first third, the characters (which beforehand were fascinating)
all have their identities fixed and then they never change. We
learn a lot about Penelope in the beginning, but then she&#8217;s
static. Similarly, the ending just doesn&#8217;t feel right given what
we know about the character&#8217;s feelings. Nevertheless, it was a
unique and cute movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a CRAZY episode. The whole plot line is pretty cool and
exciting, but I kind of wish there was more in it. For example,
Holmes doesn&#8217;t defend himself at all, but it would great for him
to do so. I loved that he was in contempt of court, but we don&#8217;t
know what he said. There were lots of clever moments like that. I
loved the way Moriarty explained that social engineering is more
effective than hacking. I thought the ending was far too obvious,
especially with regard to Holmes enlisting Molly&#8217;s help. In that
respect it is obvious, but on the other hand it is ridiculous
that there&#8217;s going to be an explanation for how he survived,
tricked the people at morgue (presumably Molly just did it?),
etc. I&#8217;m a bit pessimistic about where the show will go from
here. The ending is so &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; in its incredulity,
that I could imagine Moriarty not really being dead too. The show
has upped the stakes so much, it seems like they can&#8217;t really go
back to pedestrian plots.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very interesting episode. I liked that it was a
&#8220;monster of the week&#8221; kind of episode and not an episode about
the epic story. It was neat that the interpersonal story of
James and Sherlock was explored so much as well.</p>
