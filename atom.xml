I'm finding this game has a higher percentage of the kinds of Lolo
puzzles I don't like. I don't like when a puzzle requires a lot of
execution skill, because the controls in these games are so
awkward. I also don't like it when you have to use "holes" and
riding on eggs in water, because you can't really predict where
they will go, so it seems unfair because you can't plan your
solution totally before doing it. Nevertheless, I'm still having
fun.

thought that the plot was interesting and fairly advanced for the

computer-animated. There's nothing about the world or the story
that really needs it, and instead because it is animated there are
some ridiculous set pieces that don't feel right for the world. I
found the style to be a bit strange... the heads on all the
characters except for Tintin are too big. It was definitely
striking visually.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html" /><updated>2013-03-19T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/19/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--0.html">Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/19/">19</a></span></span><pre class="content">I started this and played up to Level 3 Room 9. The main
difference between this and the previous games is (a) the ability
to play as Lala, which seems to just be a sprite change, and (b)
the separate areas that divide up the puzzles into a kind of
narrative. I find it a bit stupid and tedious to have to do
things other than solve puzzles. It seems strange to me that the
creators would think that people really care about the "world" of
Lolo enough to want to feel like they are "exploring" it, rather
than just doing puzzles. In any case, the puzzles I've done so
far have been fun and have included a few tough ones. I'm looking
forward to completing it.

Japanese country-side theme and old-timey era. However, I found it
to be much less satisfying than River City Ransom. The game world
seems huge in comparison and confusingly organized: the majority
of the time I played I just wandered around in a big circle and
ended back in the starting town. I had no idea where I was
supposed to go or how to trigger the boss encounters that control
the progression of these games. The lack of context and the
increased world size really did damage to my appreciation of
it. The game did seem more complex in other ways too though: you
seem to be able to pick up, spin, and throw enemies, which was
new. Also, your "brother" is always present, if A.I. controlled,
which is neat. Nevertheless, I couldn't play it and put it down.

Boss 5, especially because I had the Shield and Pea-shooter
rather than the Powerbeam. (Later, during the boss rush, when I
fought Boss 5, it was still hard but MUCH easier.) The game is
really interesting and does some really mind-warping things with
the gravity flipping and the toroidal level designs. I had a lot
of fun playing it. My final score was 528,154.

I
basically just had to go through the final dungeon and beat the
final boss marathon. I didn't find the bosses that challenging.
The formula was to use the last two spells over and over and then
use items to get back some MP. It was a bit of a disappointing
ending. In addition, there's not really a final cut-scene... they
spent most of their "ending" juice on the faux-ending is seems.

Overall, I'd say that this game was beautiful and mechanically
sound, but too boring for my taste. There was a lot of variability
in the game... like the treat system and the huge number of
familiars... that I never really needed to use, which felt like a
let down. I wish there would have been more reason to switch
familiars, for example, rather than just find a few that I had
affinities for and use them the whole time. I also wish that
faster modes of ground transportation would have unlocked, because
moving around in the game started to feel really tedious.

I can imagine recommending the game to a kid, but I don't think I
would to an adult and definitely not a marginal RPG fan. If you
are just going to play one or two RPGs, there are much better
options.

game would be abstract, like the Technos soccer and hockey games
are, but I was disappointed.

I found it to be
pretty mediocre, but not insultingly bad. The first level is a
very boring straight-line with slopes that you strangely have to
jump over and can't walk up. There's no structure on the powers,
which you can access right away. I remember seeing the box of this
game and playing it when I was younger, but it didn't catch me and
I don't feel like I need to give it a lot of respect and
attention.

grinding. The game convinces you it is going to end very
convincingly, but pulls back and does something different and
surprising right at the end. The need to go fight each of the
kingdom's leaders again is very surprising. I'm now on my way to
fight the witch, after I've learned about her history and
relation to Pea. I feel like I'm almost done.

they are back to level 1, I'll need to grind before I can
continue.
