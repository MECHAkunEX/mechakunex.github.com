I found
the game to continue to be very adorable. The final area wasn't
particularly hard, but it was very fun to get the Phoenix shot
upgrade.

Overall, I found the game to be very fun and cute. I would
definitely recommend it for the good mechanics and the nice
story. The story and mechanics, however, don't feel good enough to
me to warrant many replays, so I don't think I will play it
again. But I definitely will think of it fondly.

I'm excited to see what connections future Quintet games will have
to this world.

I
got to the third area and did almost everything I could at this
point in the earlier areas. Although I know that there will be
more to do once I can damage metal enemies.

The game is very cute and there's a lot more connections and
similarities to Actraiser. It's like you're a different avatar of
"The Master". You move around to different towns to restore. There
was even a kid named Teddy! (That's the name of a kid from
Bloodpool in Actraiser.) I really enjoyed the second area, because
it was a town of animals. In both of the first two areas, you also
go into the dreams of a plant :) It was neat too when an old man
says he's was lonely when his wife died but then got a goat to
take care of; when you talk to the goat, it says it's the wife
reincarnated and even though she can't talk to her husband, she's
glad to be around him. Cute.

The combat is getting a little more complex as there are more
enemies that shoot projectiles, etc. But it's not incredibly
complicated, because the controls are so stiff and tile-based.

I remember seeing this
game in Nintendo Power and being incredibly impressed by the
visuals. Now that I am older and playing it, it feels like the
visuals are the main reason for this game being terrible. The
sprites are too big for the action and the hit boxes are real
bad. Amazingly, it is a 2D platformer with camera problems. When
you die, if you move to the right, then the screen doesn't scroll
with your ghost. This made it so I couldn't see the next platform,
I had to go backwards then right again to get it to
scroll. There's really nothing special about this game at all.

The row system is a little neat and there's clearly a lot of

time. I've played Illusion of Gaia before and it's a lot like
it. It's a traditional action RPG, but there are something neat
things about it.

In the story/structure, it is very similar to Quintet's Actraiser
(which I just played), in that as you fight monsters, you
"restore" lost parts of the towns and unlock people who were
captive and now tell you about their lives. I've enjoyed the
reveals so far. My favorite was a goat that, after giving you a
hint, said, "I have other things to attend to now", and then
walked off.

In the battle mechanics, it's also like Actraiser in that there
are monster spawn points that release one monster after
another. The difference, though, is that here you just have to
kill a certain number and then the spawn point is sealed. Since
you know where they are going to spawn, there's a temptation to
sit on top of it and spam the attack, but they thought of that and
the enemies are invulnerable when they first appear, but they can
still hurt you. Instead, you have to stand a little bit of a way
back and spam the attack button. =) I haven't gotten to a place
where the combat is tricky, but it does feel good, and that counts
for a lot.

I'll definitely keep playing this.

on the NES. I love the Rogue-like "hunger" system. It's very
unique.

This game was incredibly similar to those games, although with a
lot more of a slow pace. In the NES game, you seem to almost
always have a skateboard, so it's more like a modern "runner" in
that you just control the jumping (and shooting.) I found this one
to be much more deliberate and that it emphasized using the
weapons against the enemies more, whereas that seemed to be more
of a bonus in the earlier game.

Like a lot of early SNES games I've been playing, I feel like
they got drunk on giant sprites and didn't polish the tightness
and feel of the game enough. I'm excited about the next game
though, because I hear it is drastically different.

This game is a lot worse than the NES Castlevania games and it is
nowhere close to Dracula X. I think the biggest problem is the
really stiff transitions between states. You can very clear see
the game stutter when you jump, start swinging, get on a ladder,
etc. Unlike the first game, where the deliberateness of the game
seems to be a purposeful feature... in this game it seems like a
bad mistake.

In addition, I agree with the Sequelitis estimation of the
negative aspects of the eight-way whip: the combat sequences are
simply easy. I barely got hit a single time and the only times I
died, it was because of falling during platforming (primarily
during swinging segments.)

I played it for a
while and got to level 4. It's pretty brilliant and unique.

It's basically an "Action RPG", but whereas games like Zelda II
and Kingdom Hearts add RPG mechanics to a popular action genre,
Super Ninja Boy takes a normal RPG structure---world map, random
battles, etc---but then puts action mechanics into the random
battles. I get the impression that increasing levels would make a
difference with the combat, but I never noticed it.

This sounds great, and it is, but the action mechanics are just
terrible. It is so sluggish. It almost seems like it is trying to
be in slow motion when you jump. It's kind of embarrassing
actually.

The text and story is ridiculous too. The opening cinematic with
"Emperor Chin of Chinaland". Ouch.

game. I got everything in the game and got to the ending. The
ending is so moving... I nearly cried as the intro music played
again as all the characters came back. The final moments are crazy
too because there is yet another "true enemy" reveal.

Despite fighting through the lunar underground pretty easily and
getting every item in the game /and/ having full health... I was
destroyed by Zeromus instantly after just about two rounds.

I really dislike it when a JRPG doesn't give you a reason to
grind. When I grind to gather money to get more items, that's
fine, because I'm earning the money and I get the levels at the
same time. When you have to get into random battles as you are
going through a maze and gathering treasure chests, it's
fine. But if I can make it to the boss and get all the items, I
should have grinded enough to do it.

I couldn't bring myself to grind to defeat Zeromus. I looked into
using a Game Genie code to move it along faster, but they didn't
work. So I'm calling it done.

Final Fantasy 2 is amazing.

I made it past the moon and
into the Giant of Babil. This game is so great in its huge
scope... you even go to the moon! I'm finding the random battles
to be a little brutal, because they happen a lot more than I
expect... sometimes one after another.

I still need to get some stuff at the Cave of Monsters, like
equipment, etc, but I'm basically done with the non-Odin/Bahamut
side quests.

listening to the radio the majority of the day. I got through the
fight with Rubicant, which is basically the start of the last
third of the game. This game's cast is so much fun, even though
they are pretty shallow generally. There are some little moments
of depth though... like with Rydia and the fire spell. I think it
is comical how many characters nobly sacrifice themselves for the
group (and how quickly they do it too!) So funny.

The final boss
rush was really lazy and the last boss fight was really
unfair. Prior to going into the last stage, I used earthquake on
most of the towns so that they could be rebuilt with better
structures. That enabled me to get up two more levels so I would
hit the max level and have the strength to beat it.

The ending, as you go through each town again, is very cute and
the very last moment when they talk about how people don't worship
God after they become advanced is very interesting.

Overall, I found the game to fun, if messy for the reasons I
mentioned before. I think I can recommend the game, but I don't
think I would want to play it again.

The last time I played it, I used a fan translation of FFIV. I'm
noticing the difficulty level changes a lot this time. I intend
to go all the way through.

Something funny I noticed right away is that Cecil looks like a
mouse on the overworld... in particular the guy from Rocket
Knight adventures. His shadow is like a little tail.

The intro music as you leave Baron is amazing and gave me
goosebumps. So cool!

Later in the day, I got up to the Octomamm. I found that fight to
be really easy. I had about half MP on everyone and just blasted
him away.

Zone 4.

In some ways, this game is really similar to Actraiser: it fuses
two different gameplay sequences together in a way that barely
connects them. In this, there's a bland side-scrolling mode and
then the town modes where you can do mini-games and buy things. I
haven't found anything worth buying, because it's so easy to lose
things like armor and you can't buy weapons.

The style and setting of the game is really quirky and cute. It's
not just because "Hey, Japan!" It seems strange even for Japan,
with lots of weird creatures... like the octopus boss and the
weird pink masked guys.

I can't decide if I want to play it more. It's very adorable and
well known, but it isn't that good. I wonder if maybe there's
something great further in? If I look online, it looks like I'm a
little less than half-way through.

I played for another twenty-ish minutes and couldn't make it
through Zone 4's boss. I decided it wasn't worth continuing.
