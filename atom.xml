    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played this game with my kids this morning. Once I played, I
got to the first Act of the Marble Zone. My daughter played and
managed to get through most of the first level, including dealing
with the jumps, but then got stuck a bit. The first zone was
pretty good and easy. The second zone was brutal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played this game for about an hour this morning. The beginning
is a really cool &#8220;abilitease&#8221;. I find the movement speed really
painful. I worked my way to the castle in the north and then
back. This game is one of the most Dragon-Quest-y clones I&#8217;ve
played recently. When I first played it, it had been a long time
since I played a Dragon Quest game, so I didn&#8217;t realize it. But
now, it&#8217;s quite amazing. Even down to the Dragon Quest 2 problem
of attacks against monsters that are now gone not
connecting. It&#8217;s cute so far though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had no expectations about this movie. It was pretty cute and
interesting. I think depressed people are stupid, so I didn&#8217;t
really like the part of it that justified them, although a big part
of it didn&#8217;t (Craig&#8217;s conclusion is that depression is
self-indulgent.) I though Emma Roberts&#8217; character was very cute,
although we don&#8217;t learn anything about her, other than that she&#8217;s
cute and quirky. The final sequence in the movie where we see what
Craig does with his life is more interesting than a lot of moments
in the movie. The character of Bobby is actually sad, but again,
everyone in the movie is just a caricature with no substance, so
we don&#8217;t really know what his feels truly are. The movie is
annoying in that way.</p>

I&#8217;d heard it was very good. I enjoyed it a great deal. I felt very
bad for the guy&#8230; it must have been hard to grow up like that and
to be used to so badly your whole life&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we played for about an hour and a half. I beat three of the
Doc Robot stages but the Quick Man duplicate kept getting me. I
can&#8217;t dodge him very well and even though I have a lot of E-Tanks,
when I use the Gemini Laser or the Search Snake, I can use them
while a &#8220;bullet&#8221; is out. Very painful. The last time I died on the
spike vertical corridor and had to fight the boss again. Pain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to play this game today and had a really weird
experience. Every time I tried to load the game we saved from
before, the screen went blank. I think it is an incompatibility
with the PowerPak. But there weirdest thing was that when I put
in the actual cart (which I own, of course), it couldn&#8217;t get
passed the title screen&#8230; it also went black. I was able to
start a new game and get passed the first boss. But, on the way
back to the village with the axe, my daughter knocked the SNES
and the game froze. So frustrating.</p>

about three matches! The time I won, I didn&#8217;t get knocked down
until the third round and I only got knocked down once and I got
him four times over the course of the fight. I won by decision,
which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>I played the title defense for a little bit, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
spend much time on it unless my kids are interested.</p>

I got to Stage 9. I found it incredibly difficult to get past the
bone pillars&#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t get the rhythm I needed to
destroy their fireballs. It was brutal.</p>

<p>I played again latter in the day for 30 minutes and got to
Stage 11. I found it very hard that time to get past the flea men
being dropped from the eagles. This game is so hard. I don&#8217;t like
that I can&#8217;t restart at where I was, but I appreciate that I have
to get good at the whole game to win.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoyed the first Atlas Shrugged movie, so I decided to
support this by seeing it in the theatre. This felt like it had a
smaller budget, despite having the same budget. I feel like because
this part of the book is so depressing, the movie lacks a lot of
excitement. But, I enjoyed it and hope there can be a conclusion. I
feel like total cast swap was really bad&#8230; my wife was very
confused by who people were and I thought that this Dagny was much
worse that Taylor Schilling, who was beautiful and powerful.</p>

embellishments of the story, particularly the relationship of the
Evil Queen and her brother, were really cool. Kristen Stewart was
beautiful in it and played the part very well. I thought she was
awkward fighting, but feel like it was purposeful. Definitely a
fun movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about thirty minutes today and beat Gemini Man and
Needle Man. My daughter (2) played the beginning of Gemini Man&#8217;s
stage. She killed a penguin! She&#8217;s getting pretty good at moving
and jumping at the same time&#8230; something my son has a bit of
trouble with. We were very proud of her.</p>

<p>I need the extra Needle Man stage after, but the pole-vaulters
after the flying sequence knocked me off the ladder and down to
the bottomless pit two screens down. It was very sad, especially
because I didn&#8217;t have the energy to use the Rush Jet again
(because the energy ups were now gone!) It was very very sad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for like an hour and half today. I got to stage 15, which
was a really hard part. There were many moments that were
atrociously difficult&#8212;basically anything with Fleamen or Medusa
Heads.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster boss was particularly tough, at least
until I beat the entire level perfectly and kept the Holy Water
the whole time so I could blast him with it. There are many
moments in the game that feel so unfair unless you never died to
get there. It&#8217;s similar to a lot of old shmups where if you die
and loss all your power ups, you&#8217;re basically toast.</p>

<p>The part I got to, where there&#8217;s Medusa Heads and an Axe Knight
seems totally unfair. But it&#8217;s super satisfying to beat a level in
this game. It&#8217;s a bit frustrating that there are no passwords and
I have to work all the way back the next time I want to play. Cry.</p>

town and unlocked most of the challenge missions, but couldn&#8217;t do
any of the combat ones. I&#8217;m really slow at the game. I really hate
controls that make you tilt and touch the screen. I feel like
whenever I tilt it, I&#8217;m moving it away from myself. It&#8217;s
infuriating, because I feel like if I was just using a normal
control scheme it would be trivial. Overall the game is still very
fun, although the &#8220;stealth&#8221; mission was really un-intuitive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight and beat the game. I just
took the Sigma levels really patiently. I filled up all my tanks
and energy after every encounter and used the charged C-Sting to
get invulnerability during the painful hallway after Vile in
Sigma 1. I was able to get to the final form of Sigma on one
life. Then it took about five or six tries to beat him, but
eventually I did it. I just needed to learn how to dodge
him. This was an awesome game. Loved it so bad.</p>

all set up and I did all the &#8220;recharging&#8221; missions around the
first area. The style of the game is really cool and the character
has a very cute personality, despite being the typical blank
slate. The world is really strange and the gap between normal
people and the main character is reminiscent of Bayonetta. The
mechanics are very satisfying&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m Superman first
learning to fly. I will shoot myself up into the air, aim and then
shoot down to get somewhere. I don&#8217;t feel like I can aim fast
enough though, so I&#8217;m pretty bad at fighting and all the timed
challenges. I feel like the analog nubs on the Vita aren&#8217;t precise
or fast enough for me, but this feels a little bit too excusey and
I&#8217;ll probably get used to it as I play. It&#8217;s a fun little
game&#8230; definitely beautiful and innovative. If only I didn&#8217;t have
to ever touch the screen. I hate touching screens and getting my
fingerprints all over them. I just want them to stay pristine.</p>

Man. I think it took three continues. The kids instigated it and I

game&#8230; gradually.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I beat Hard Man and Snake Man. Snake Man, and
his level, were excruciatingly hard. I found it very hard to
avoid Snake Man or do enough damage, but I lucked out with a good
pattern when I finally got him. I found the smoke stacks to be
the worst part of his level. A few times when the platform
appeared it launched me off into the abyss. Other times, the
bullets would hit me in mid-air, even if I killed them first
(because they&#8217;d respawn when I realigned so I wouldn&#8217;t be pushed
off. It was very painful.</p>
