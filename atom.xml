Golf game before, but I&#8217;ve been curious. The PS Vita bundle I
bought came with it, so I figured, what the heck. I played two
holes as Yuna. It was kind of fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for two hours tonight and got to 11.5. There were so
many absurd moments. I loved how Asura flew by punching the
ground and riding the shock wave. I loved the onsen sequence and
how Asura was denied. I loved how Augus and Asura are
inexplicably on the moon and how ridiculously huge Augus&#8217; sword
is (and how he&#8217;s never drawn it but once). I loved the gigantic
crater from the sword and how Asura always ends up with no
arms. It&#8217;s also very intriguing that Augus was robot-y too. What
could that mean?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played for about two hours and beat the rest of the factory
levels. We discovered a way to grind for balloons but decided not
to. We traded our time for just using a cheat code that gives
infinite balloons. It&#8217;s amazing how much more fun the game is
now, because we can play a little less cautiously and give my
wife more opportunities to do the difficult platforming sequences
where she used to just climb on my back. I think that might be
why we liked Mario so much more, because the Desert Life grind is
so effective.</p>

two episodes. The &#8220;ending&#8221; was cool and the awesome arm-less
fight. This game is just sooo ridiculous. I can tell my wife is
kind of appalled at how insane it is. I love that about it.</p>

then decided to try to grind for balloons, but there&#8217;s no good
opportunities to, so we gave up that for a bit and did something

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought this game on the recommendation of the Giant Bomb
podcast. Tonight I played for a little less than two hours and
played through the first five episodes. This game is insane. I
love the over-the-top-ness. I love the TV show stylings. The
combat and shooting feel interesting and like I&#8217;m doing something,
although I get the impression that I can&#8217;t lose and it&#8217;s just a
matter of smashing enough until I can Burst, although I suppose I
could simply pay attention to my score at the end. So far, I think
it&#8217;s a really unique and amazing experience.</p>

fairies. We lost the last fairy in the fight versus Agahnim, which
we entered with only three hearts. After that, I fought Ganon,
but failed to use a potion after using a fairy, then filled up
again and won. Woot!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We played a few levels tonight and finished Area 6. I found a lot
of the levels to be really difficult to have two people, because
they use forced scrolling and the timed barrel jumps, which
require a lot more synchronization than is reasonable between two
people. Overall, the game seems to have multiplayer as an after
thought, especially with the varied capabilities of the two
players. The boss of Area 6 was very exciting to beat with my
wife, we were yelling and jumping out of our seats as we
recognized tells of the boss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This movie was fun, but definitely not as good as the first one. I
think the plot was much weaker and the cast was kind of thrown
together for no good reason&#8212;whereas the first one had a very
nice progression of how people joined the group.</p>

<p>Rosamund Pike was very beautiful, but it was very weird that the
actress from the previous movie was replaced and because she acted
so differently than the character before I didn&#8217;t realize it was
supposed to be the same person.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t feel like the sequel was really necessary, which
is unfortunate, because I thought the first one was so good.</p>

the first half. I beat dungeons six and seven, then started
Ganon&#8217;s Tower, but didn&#8217;t do too much of it. I also got the Golden
Sword and Silver Arrows and the 1/2 magic thing. This is such a
great game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a much better movie than the last one. I think my
favourite part of it was how it is basically the story of Catholic
theology: God enters the Void and creates Angels to assist Him in
creating perfection, but later finds (or creates) Humans, who are
imperfect, but have agency and can therefore grow and experience
love, but this upsets His chief Angel who fights against Him out of
jealousy. This particular story takes an approach very similar to
His Dark Materials, where God loses and someone has to come and
save him. The film is very cool throughout.</p>

third, fourth, and fifth crystals. We ended up doing about a third
of the third dungeon to get it. Once we got the Titan&#8217;s Mitt in
the fourth dungeon, we got a few things around the world to power
up before finishing the boss fight&#8230; including all four bottles.</p>

to do. It was a very cute ending. I&#8217;d say it wasn&#8217;t the best
story, but it was very cute and probably the second best. I also
like how it explains how Luke and Layton meet. You do wonder where
Emmy and Decole went though.</p>
