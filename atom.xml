I did the Overseer
ship but the very next mission was really hard to do and I've
restarted it three or four times. There are two Sectopods right
away and it's very hard to get organized enough to take them
out. I bought an Alloy SHIV, but it doesn't seem to be very
reliable, since it can't take cover.

--

In the evening I played for about three hours and I beat the
game. I did one short mission (against a downed battleship, which
gave me a LOT of materials) and then I skipped missions until the
Gollop Chamber was made and I could go to the ending.

The final mission was pretty challenging, especially against the
Sectopods and the Mutons. The dialogue was pretty interesting,
although the whole game was incredibly anti-climatic. The final
room was trivial: I walked it with one character, she shot the
boss, then my sniper was in range and got a head-shot and killed
him. None of the enemies had any chance to react, so I didn't see
their powers in anyway. Some of the earlier fights were pretty
easy too, because the Rift attack is so powerful. (But they were
challenging to set up.) The resolution of the story was pretty
terrible too (not that I care too much about it... but they seemed
to)---the voice work was /so/ bad and they tried to express
emotion with these flat character models. The worst part though
was that they didn't resolve the interesting dialogue about the
purpose of the aliens at all.

Overall, I found the game to be really fun. Most of my complaints
are about the interface. I feel like you converge incredibly
quickly to knowing what the right strategy is and then the rest
of game is dealing with the fog of war and dealing with failed
shots because of random chance. Looking at it like that, it
doesn't feel very fun. And I think that's why I don't feel like I
want to play again right away. But I do like the mechanics so I
intend to play it again at some point, just not now.

I like the way they stick to the
"found footage" concept and explain the good camera work in many
scenes by the telekinetic powers. I thought the ending, where they
jump from all sorts of different cameras was cool.

I really like the way it is a very naturalistic and realistic
depiction of how super-heroes (and villains) would be created. I
like the way the evil in the movie is so real and not cartoony.

I feel like the movie leaves open all sorts of mundane questions,
like how does Matt's girlfriend feel about her experience? What did
the people in Seattle say about what happened? Etc. The thing
that's cool about these questions is that because they are mundane,
they mean that the movie was able to make me care about the normal
feelings of people in the background, etc. It's neat.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2012/">2012</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: XCOM: Enemy Unknown (PS3, 2012) (4)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html" /><updated>2013-03-29T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/29/Game--XCOM--Enemy-Unknown--PS3--2012--3.html">Game: XCOM: Enemy Unknown (PS3, 2012) (4)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/29/">29</a></span></span><pre class="content">I've continued playing.

I'm still really strapped for items, but I'm starting to buy up
everything. One of my big questions right now is whether I should
use the Ghost Armor and whether I should spend money to get a
SHIV, and if so, which one.

I did a lot of missions
trying to get the resources to get to the next level of the
game---building a ship and taking down the Overseer ship. I
started to have really bad injuries after most battles, forcing me
to expand my stable of troops.

I'm finding the combat to be very same-y: I know what I need to
do, almost algorithmically, and when it fails, it's almost always
because of the random number generator. Since you can't change the
outcomes by save scumming, you have to just reload and try
something slightly different (sometimes just doing the actions in
a different order) and you'll get the result you want. I feel like
as the game is progressing, the enemies are increasing in strength
at the same rate I am, so the difficulty has plateaued and there's
no new strategy to learn.

In the meta-game of managing the base, I feel so tightly
constrained by a lack of materials, there's almost nothing to
actually do. I spent some time making it so I could have tons of
satellites in the air. (In fact, in 10 days of game time, I will
have a satellite in every country.) One side-effect of that is
that I now have a ridiculous amount of money. Unfortunately it
doesn't really matter because I don't have enough Alloy, etc to
actually build anything. It makes me wish there were a way to buy
Alloy or purposefully go on a mission that would net you some.

I definitely still like the game and see a lot of good in it, but
as I continue to play, I am getting less and less enamored with
it and see more of its flaws.

The most glaring flaw is the horrible UI for modifying your troops
load outs. There's no easy way to make sure you are sending your
guys out with your best stuff. You need to manually go to every
other character that you aren't going to use and make sure to
de-equip them with everything. The game really needed to just show
you everything that was available in the menu and have it get
de-equipped when you selected it if it was in use, with perhaps
the constraint that you couldn't de-equip from people in the
active squad. That would do wonders for the experience of playing
the game.

die. It was sad, because he was so high level.

I'm continuing to be nervous about having done the wrong thing
and, in particular, that I won't have enough fighter jets to deal

In many ways the game is reminiscent of Mega Man, except you don't
gain abilities from bosses and the power-ups aren't useful
(they're like Castlevania power-ups in that they give you the
ability to shoot in different directions) and the consequences for
getting hurt seem much much higher. Apparently Darkwing's pain
threshold just isn't very high.

Every screen was a huge battle that wore me down. I decided to
leave it at that. I now know that this game is pretty solid, but
not better than Mega Man. The main distinctive thing about is the
large number of jumping/hanging platform sequences, which we
pretty neat.

a few continues. I found that in the three boss battles I had,
the enemies took absurd amounts of damage. I got passed the first
one by using each of the characters in a sequence, using up all
their energy before going to the next one.

I feel like this game is really tight and nice for its age. I
don't have any connection to it and some things about it are very
frustrating and unsatisfying. I think I will put it back on the
queue as a "revisit later" game. The multiple characters are
definitely interesting, although it is a bit much to manage all
their energy gauges and then make sure you deliberately switch
away from one as it is about to die. Definitely a really
intriguing game, but not something I fell in love with right away.

off-kilter in a cute way. It is very adorable to see chickens
running around and being attacked by hot dogs and stuff. It's
pretty cute, but not a /good/ game.

levels but died on the third after meeting an wall of resistance
in the form of lots of little monsters that swarmed me.

This felt like a solid, average, platform-action game with melee
combat. The only interesting things were the power-up system
based on three-letter strings of A and B, but all the power-ups
felt pretty useless so it wasn't worth learning which I should be
building up to. The other interesting thing was the way you had
to spend money on upgrades during the levels, but it was a bit
annoying because you didn't keep them from screen transition to
screen transition.

The two bosses I fought were really easy. I played each twice and
beat it without getting hit a single time on the second try,
because the pattern was so clear.

I can imagine having spent a lot of time on this game in an era
when there was nothing else to do, because it feels pretty
solid. But, today it doesn't feel strong enough to be worth an
investment.

I found the second to last mini-boss to
be really easy once you had an idea of what the strategy was. The
last boss was REALLY hard, because every time I threw the ball
back it missed and then I got hit again. It was very
challenging. The game reminded me a lot of Metroid at the end,
because every time I died, I stood in front of a frog creature
and grinded to get my energy back. It was very tedious and un-fun
to do, of course.

Overall, I found the game to be very enjoyable. I think it is a
bit too maze-like to enjoy again. But I like the feel of the
world a lot and enjoyed the experience.

I think my favourite part of it is that
(a) the war is defensive, (b) the idea that the military simpler
exists to protect civilians is very prominent, (c) the soldiers
are "everymen" who aren't the focal point of the war... except a
little bit at the end, and (d) the nobility of the troops. 

It's a very exciting movie too and the alien threat seems "real"
and not super comic-y. It was really great. I really liked the
depiction of aliens and the way the achieved superiority---the
cyborg enhancements and the way they were driving around
artillery/cannon like units.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2011/">2011</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991) (5)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html" /><updated>2013-03-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2013/03/23/Game--Adventures-of-Lolo-3--NES--1991--4.html">Game: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES, 1991) (5)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2013/">2013</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2013/03/">03</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2013/03/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">I played this morning for about two hours and got to 13-5.

really tired of the game... I'd play a level for about 15 minutes
and then get stuck and have to look up a hint. It feels like I'm
not really solving the levels anymore. I assuage my feelings of
inadequacy by thinking that it's because so much seems to rely on
the timing, places where enemies will respawn after being blocked,
etc.

Despite quitting, I've enjoyed this game a lot and recommend it.
