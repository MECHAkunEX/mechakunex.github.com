    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two and half hours tonight. I did a whole bunch
of battles. The hardest was the Normal Skirmish that&#8217;s like the
Woodland battle. It took me quite a few tries to get an A with
Alicia. Playing the game like this makes it like Metal Gear Solid
when you are trying to get a No Alert win. It&#8217;s a very strange
optimization problem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about 30 minutes today and did a dungeon and a
boss. It&#8217;s nice how bite-sized this game can be. I&#8217;m really
hurting for cash in the game though and I don&#8217;t want to grind for
it right now. I&#8217;d much rather grind to be able to go &#8220;deeper&#8221; into
some place than just fighting enemies I know I can handle so I can
get some cash.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours today. I replayed the first Skirmish
to get As, then I did the next two story battles (riverside and
bridge)&#8212;getting As both times, the first in one round, the
second in two&#8212;then did the next skirmish that is like the
riverside battle twice in a row (Easy then Normal) getting
one-round As as well. I spent a lot of time reading the background
material that is unlocking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using a really cheap technique because I want high rankings on
the battles. If I need to occupy an enemy camp (which is what
every battle has been since the Prologue), I blitz Alicia to the
base with the Defense/Evade Boost buffs active. Sometimes I need
to use a shock trooper to rush with her a little bit to destroy
the first few enemies. Sometimes I need to get the enemies out of
the base quickly, to occupy it, so I will either head shot them or
throw grenades to blow up the sandbags and/or launch them outside
the base boundaries. For the bridge battle, I was able to win in
two rounds without killing any enemies because my two grenades
launched them out. Near the end of the phase, each of her moves
barely got her closer at all, but I was able to use another
Ragnaid to survive the huge barrage of incoming fire.</p>

<p>I feel a little bad doing this exploit. Primarily because while
this gives my /characters/ the most experience; it gives me, the
/player/, the least experience. Hopefully there will be other
fights that have different objectives that will stress me
differently to get As. The main problem is that because I can&#8217;t do
the story battles more than once, I feel pressure to get an A on
the first try, which leads to this ridiculous tactic. If I knew I
could try again, then I would just play it normally, then try
again for an A.</p>

<p>I have my first complaints about the game. They are pretty minor,
interface complaints, but I think it would make things a lot nicer
if they were fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can&#8217;t reset battles voluntary. If you die, you can restart
from the beginning of the battle, but you can&#8217;t decide that
you&#8217;ve made a mistake and go back to the beginning. The only way
to do this is to make a hard save in Command mode and reload
it. This process is very cumbersome.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t auto-save before battles. If you go into a
battle and die, you can restart from the beginning of the battle
without making a save yourself, but you are stuck with the
deployment decisions you originally made, which means you need
to make a hard save before every battle anyways in case you
don&#8217;t put enough Lancers, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t give you battle statistics, like which
skirmishes you have A ranks on. I see a faded out Statistics
tab, that I will probably get in the future, but I don&#8217;t see why
this is kept from me.</p></li>
<li><p>The game doesn&#8217;t do a good job of helping you keep track of what
new content is available. For example, if there are new weapons
available for R&amp;D, there is no way to know that without going to
the HQ, then to R&amp;D, then to Weapons, then to the individual
kind of weapon. There should be an icon at every level of the
hierarchy that says something new is beneath that level. At
least with Book mode and some of the setting documents, it lists
which ones you have not read yet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So far I&#8217;m really like the story and the gameplay. It&#8217;s a really
fun game!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about five hours today during my looong travel
home. I got to the hero&#8217;s story and I&#8217;m finding it a little
confusing compared to what came before because so much of the
world is available. I also always dislike it in games when I have
a lot of options for which characters to use, because it is hard
to make the &#8220;best&#8221; choice and keep all the characters balanced.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for a little bit tonight and started the twin sister&#8217;s
quest. So far it is intriguing. It is a little bit annoying to
take another group from level 1, especially when they don&#8217;t have
new attributes (they&#8217;re just a healer and a mage, like the
companions in Chapter 2.) There also seem to be really poor
enemies in the area, but expensive items at the towns.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started playing this today on a flight to D.C.. The graphics are
new, but the gameplay is very old. Nevertheless, it is strangely
satisfying to make ever longer &#8220;trips&#8221; as you increase your
stats. The script is simultaneously really funny and sounds
horribly translated, but it is actually the dialects they give the
characters. The plot is interesting, because I feel things slowly
coming together as you visit different people and play as them.</p>

<p>Torneko&#8217;s chapter was really strange because you&#8217;re trying to
raise money, just like normal, but you&#8217;re doing it in such a
strange way and trying to get such huge amounts. He also seems to
get treasure chest drops from enemies much more often than the
other characters. I stopped for the day after I finished the
tunnel.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife read this book for book group (I think that&#8217;s why) and
wanted me to as well. It was not the worst book ever, but I didn&#8217;t
like it that much. My main problem with was the weakness of its
plot and its predictability. Practically nothing happens in it and
the characters are strong enough to carry a story where nothing
major happens. The slice of life isn&#8217;t slicey enough because there
aren&#8217;t even interesting vignettes about the girl&#8217;s life. The
predictability is really bad. I was about half-way through the book
yesterday (long plane trip today) and I talked to my wife about it
and told her what I thought would happen&#8230; and I was exactly
correct on all counts. That&#8217;s pretty bad. It&#8217;s not even like a
standard romantic comedy where it is sticking to a formula, it&#8217;s
just that the story is so cliche and obvious that there&#8217;s basically
only one thing that <em>could</em> happen given the way she&#8217;s set it up.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m begin too hard on a Young Adult book, but eh, it wasn&#8217;t
for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about three hours today. I got to the part where
Squad 7 is officially formed and did the first Skirmish twice
(once on each difficulty level.) I think that&#8217;ll be my
method&#8230; whenever there is a new Skirmish, do it twice. Or maybe
I&#8217;ll play them until I can (a) level everyone and (b) buy every
available upgrade.</p>

<p>So far, I really like the game. The gameplay is really unique and
interesting&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot of strategy to it. The story, which
at this point is more of just a setting, is really compelling. I
can&#8217;t wait to play more. I found the opening swell as they left
Bruhl to be very heart-warming and it almost made me tear a
little. I appreciate the pacifism of the game.</p>

<p>I like it when fiction uses words without explaining them, but
that you know what they mean. For example, in this some characters
refer to the &#8220;Imps&#8221;, which I reckon means &#8220;Imperials.&#8221; Kind of
obvious, yeah, but cute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a big budget popcorn summer movie, but a pretty good one
of that category. It starts off, and sounds like, it will be just
like all the other movies, with practically the same setup; but it
quickly acknowledges that and goes in a different direction. They
didn&#8217;t over use the faces, like they&#8217;ve done before, and they there
was only one real bad scene of Tom Cruise fawning over himself. I
think my major disappointments were its lack of a romantic sub-plot
and the lack of real consequences to not being able to use IMF
resources&#8212;even though they explicitly mention how that is
standing in their way at a few points, they solve the problem too
easily.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours today. I went through one dungeon
and got to a really hard boss fight. I&#8217;ve been on a pattern of try
the boss then go back to the beginning of the dungeon fighting
dudes and back so I can gain some levels and try again. I think
I&#8217;ve had about 5 or 6 loops so far. It&#8217;s pretty brutal too because
there&#8217;s a medium difficulty boss battle before it that you have to
go through, so each failing boss fight takes about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been talking with my wife about some of the stupid stuff in
this game. The biggest problem with it is the lack of agency in
almost every aspect of the game.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each unit has specific skills, like Smash II or Restore III, but
you don&#8217;t get to choose what skills will actually be
used. Instead, you choose between a few &#8220;baskets&#8221; of
attacks. For example, you might have the option &#8221;<em>REDACTED</em>ge&#8221; which
has your five guys just do basic attacks and then you&#8217;ll also
have &#8220;Attack &#8216;em hard, man&#8221; which has two of your guys do two
seemingly random physical attacks. There&#8217;s no option to just
determine what your units will do.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s not even possible for you to always choose each type of
basket. For example, generally there is a (1) no AP basket, (2)
physical AP basket, (3) magic AP basket, (4) healing AP basket,
and (5) hexing/buffing basket. Each one sometimes has a second
variant that uses much more AP. However, it&#8217;s not the case that
on any given round you can choose between any of the baskets. I
have no idea what algorithm it is using to determine what I am
allowed to do. This is most frustrating with healing. Suppose I
have 2k HP and I&#8217;m fighting something that I know can do 1.2k
damage sometimes. If I get hit and get knocked down past 1.5k,
I&#8217;d like to heal as insurance for the eventually big one. Last
Remnant does not allow this. It only gives you the ability to
heal (and other teams to heal you) when you are really low, for
some unknown definition of really low. In this case, it&#8217;s too
late. It is almost like the FF13 Paradigm system where all the
characters are AI controlled and you aren&#8217;t allowed to switch to
any Paradigm whenever you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Outside of combat, there&#8217;s a similar lack of agency in the
character progression system. You have a whole bunch of
characters, but not one of them gives you the ability to decide
what skills they will learn as they progress. Rush (the main
character) can sometimes choose between two options after a
battle, but you don&#8217;t really have any perspective on this
decision and it&#8217;s very micro. Some of the leaders will ask you
whether to focus on physical or magical attacks, but
repercussions of this are pretty vague. You can&#8217;t change the
equipment on your characters, except for the main one, but you
almost never need to do it (it seems) because there&#8217;s rarely
anything better than what you have or will find in a dungeon in
a little bit.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Despite these big game play problems, I find the core idea pretty
interesting and it&#8217;s tempting to keep playing and grind through it,
but I&#8217;m beginning to think it&#8217;s just not worth given the many other
great games that are available.</p>

<p>I find the story to be pretty intriguing and original. The
production values are pretty bad in a lot of places and some of the
micro-story bits are pretty lame, but it&#8217;s a reasonable package.</p>

<p>I feel real bad putting down games and not playing them to
completion, but I just can&#8217;t get behind such flawed game play.</p>

<p>I was having a discussion with someone the other day about what
makes good game play and I stated three things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Intuition</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The challenge of the game should require some inexplicable skill
that can&#8217;t be feasibly turned into an algorithm by
humans. Tic-Tac-Toe is flawed in this way. A shmup is super easy
to imagine (algorithm: dodge bullets when they get close), but
it&#8217;s basically impossible to succeed with such a system. Most
strategy and role-playing games can get too close to the edge of
easy to axiomatize. Games that /require/ memorization are some of
the worst offenders on this category by going in the opposite
direction from Tic-Tac-Toe; rather than having a deeply
algorithmic structure, they lack any coherence at all, so you
must resort to pure memorization.</p>

<p>The Last Remnant is pretty good in this camp, I think, but the
place where the choice enters in is pretty weak&#8212;primarily in
what order your unions attack what enemy unions and to a lesser
extent how much AP you spend on any turn.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fairness</em></li>
</ul>


<p>When you fail, it should be clear to you that it is your
fault. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should know what to do to succeed,
but rather you should believe that you did something wrong. For
example, Super Mario Brothers is very good with this, except on
the ZX Spectrum, where the lack of scrolling forced you to do
blind jumps.</p>

<p>The Last Remnant is very bad on this category because it&#8217;s lack
of player agency makes you always feel like it was the RNG that
killed you and not your lack of ability/planning/strategy/etc.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Precision</em></li>
</ul>


<p>A complement of Fairness is Precision, which means that you the
burden to communicate your intentions should be reasonable. Mario
is practically perfect here, because there is basically no delay
between your choice and the action and the set of actions (jump,
move, etc) is perfectly matched by the mechanism of choice (the
buttons on the controller.) Many games with complicated control
schemes violate the Precision principle. Many games have bad
input lag and other problems that stand in the way of
precision. Some games seem to violate Precision&#8212;like Street
Fighter, where we could imagine a 3DS style menu of the super
attacks, rather than the high-execution challenge abilities&#8212;but
some how do not, because the commands are tight and seem to flow
out of other actions you are doing anyways, and are coupled with
general tightness and precision. Sometimes a game consciously
makes the control harder as part of the challenge&#8230; DDR is
easier with four buttons that you can control with your fingers,
for example; but this is difficulty design decision to balance
and generally pushes the game from the abstract realm (the
screen) to the physical realm (dancing).</p>

<p>The Last Remnant&#8217;s lack of Fairness almost entirely comes from
its lack of Precision. It is not possible for you to choose your
actions, so you know you should heal but the game prevents
you. It&#8217;s not necessarily the case that lack of Precision leads
to lack of Fairness&#8230; the NES Castlevania games are very chunky
in their control, but somehow maintain Fairness.</p>

<p>So I guess I&#8217;ve decided to abandon The Last Remnant. I just read
the Wikipedia summary of the story and it sounds like it would
have been cool to experience, but it&#8217;s not worth the suffering. I&#8217;m
glad I played it enough to feel like I really understand the
mechanics and gave them a chance, but I think my conscious will be
clear on abandoning the game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did Puzzle 2 today, which was a classic example of what I love
and hate about these games. The puzzle was about how one picture
was different than three others. I initially answered wrong
because I selected the different one, rather than the three same
ones, because I didn&#8217;t read the directions clear enough. Argh. It
should have said that I didn&#8217;t select three rather than making me
answer wrong. Then, when I converted my answer (based on the
presence of what seemed to be a different un-movable object in the
background) and found out I was wrong. I tried a few different
logical (to me) ideas and was wrong. This made me frustrated like
there was going to be some out of nowhere explanation for the
similarities that I&#8217;d never have guessed. When the wrong reason
(standing still versus not) led to the right solution, it
described that the solution was really about the shadow of the
people in the photo to show the time&#8230; which made me happy again
because it was a reasonable explanation I could have thought of
but just didn&#8217;t.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I played for about four and a half hours and finished two
or three areas, then got to a big boss fight with the Conqueror&#8217;s
army at the Nest of Eagles. I died twice. So I decided to do a few
sidequests and come back. After doing two, I tried again and died
right away. I tried one more time and this time the RNG was on my
side and I got two Gae Bolg attacks from David in a row, took out
all the plebs and could focus on the two boss characters. I barely
won, however, with some pretty crazy luck. It was fun to face such
odds and win, but the game feels totally unfair with your lack of
control.</p>

<p>The cinematic fight between Emma and the Conqueror was really
awesome. I can&#8217;t believe how poorly they introduced and explained
the Emmy character, although I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;d at least run into her
before.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t been doing puzzles for about two months, so I decided to
start again today. So far, the story is very intriguing and the
Emmy character is funny. Normally these games take a while to get
to interesting puzzles, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a fun anime movie. I like all the little subtle visual
jokes that they have and the general wackiness of the action. I
think you need to be a little bit older to appreciate it though, so
we didn&#8217;t watch it with the kids.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for 1:38 tonight and just got through one area. There
were a few tough enemies that got me in trouble. I&#8217;m in an area
now with just one person in my group and it&#8217;s quite hard to go at
the battles in a way that lets me survive. Kind of fun. I&#8217;m
looking forward to getting the ability to have more units and
unions in my party. It will be fun to organize a big group, I
think.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about four hours tonight after putting kids to
bed. The game is growing on me quite a bit. I find the story to be
very interesting. It&#8217;s not cliche and not over the top. Although
it does move a little slow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the battle system to be more fun as I think a little
hard as I direct each union to attack. Occasionally I am close to
death, so I feel like it is a little difficult, although I haven&#8217;t
died since I restarted.</p>

<p>I made it through a bunch more areas (I&#8217;m about to go under the
temple) and had a lot of combat on the way. One thing I dislike
about the game is how poorly it communicates your character
progression. There is no summary level that you can look at
it. Instead after each fight, some characters increase some stats
based on something (use? I don&#8217;t know.) It&#8217;s almost like in FF13
where you get bonuses in very small steps, but here you don&#8217;t see
the global path so you don&#8217;t get that reptilian enjoyment of
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>When I got to a new city, Elysion, I explored all over but lost
track of the plot. I couldn&#8217;t find the trigger that would bring me
to the next segment, so I thought I might have to do a mandatory
&#8220;side&#8221; quest. This sent me to a whole bunch of new places&#8230; kind
of a hole&#8230; that turned out to be unnecessary. But on the way I
got to see something cool: the world map is sensibly connected,
because in an area next to a big city, I could see a feature of
the city in the background. That was a nice touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very predicable teen comedy of the poor to riches
variety, complete with the standard dual friend abandonment and
inner growth. Nevertheless, it was a good version of this story and
had a few cute things. A lot of the characters acknowledge the
camera too much, but when they are bit more free and their perfect
teeth aren&#8217;t totally showing, it gets a little real and that&#8217;s
nice. Overall, a fun, refreshing, ray of sunshine. Like a good pop
song on a rainy day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I played for 2:15 and got far past where I was
before. I still feel the same way about most parts of the game,
but the battle system is feeling a bit more strategic, if less
active or involved than other similar systems. The story is pretty
interesting&#8230; the concept of remnants is neat. They&#8217;re basically
totally unique high magic items in a low magic world. The voice
acting in this game is totally atrocious though. It would be much
better to just turn if off and/or have Japanese.</p>

<p>In the combat setup of unions, units, etc I feel like I&#8217;m just
making random decisions though. There are so many different
numbers and combinations, I don&#8217;t understand how to optimize it,
so I&#8217;m just getting by.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Based on my last experience with the game, I think I&#8217;m basically
done with the game. I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about it, because it is
good on many levels, but a lot of it is so broken. The structure
of the game play&#8212;5 levels at a time, no saving, is probably the
worst thing about it for me, because I like to play in such small
chunks. But also, the mechanics just aren&#8217;t tight enough for me. I
know that the physics/momentum is a conscious design decision, but
I don&#8217;t think it works. Whereas in Super Meat Boy, I can do many
sequences exactly the same every time, I find N+ to be very
variable in how I perform, even though I feel like I&#8217;m doing the
same thing, because the momentum isn&#8217;t quite right. This leads to
great frustration and lack of fun. I can&#8217;t remember if the DS game
was like this and I just hadn&#8217;t noticed because I hadn&#8217;t play SMB
yet.</p>
