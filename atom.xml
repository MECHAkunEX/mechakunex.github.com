happen. It's sad that Brienne missed Sansa's signal... I wonder
if she'll ever tell her. Arya's attack on Trant was awesome, but
it is very sad that she's now blind. It's cute that Tyrion and
Varys are now best buds teaming up. It's ridiculous that Ellaria
kills Mrycella just when she has a great bonding moment with
Jaime. Cersei's walk was very intense and it is interesting to
realize that she is now totally determined to destroy every last
one of them. It is telling that Davos' first question is about
Shireen. It's cool that Sam will be a maester. The mutiny of the

him. It's cool that Arya is about to get someone on her
list. Dany's scene was amazing. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Book: The Hero of Ages, by Brandon Sanderson (2008)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Book--The-Hero-of-Ages--by-Brandon-Sanderson--2008--0.html"/><updated>2016-07-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Book--The-Hero-of-Ages--by-Brandon-Sanderson--2008--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/07/25/Book--The-Hero-of-Ages--by-Brandon-Sanderson--2008--0.html">Book: The Hero of Ages, by Brandon Sanderson (2008)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/07/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">I started reading this today. The opening scenes were very cool. I
like that we have an explanation of sorts of why Marsh turned
against Sazed. I really don't like that Elend is a particularly
powerful Allomancer, because I really like Vin being the most
powerful one around. I really would have wanted her to be even more
powerful as a result of her touch with the Well. Nevertheless, it
was an awesome scene.

There are some really cool ideas in these opening chapters. I love
the journal entries at the top of each chapter: the idea that the
Lord Ruler really was more of a hero than people thought and that
he literally moved around the planet as a way to fight the
Mists... it's very intriguing. I like the idea that you can only
trust your thoughts because Ruin is so powerful. I suspect that the
Inquisitors killed all the Terrisman Keepers because it is a vital
ingredient in making them more powerful. This explains why the Lord
Ruler hunted them for so long.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Books/">Books</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2008/">2008</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 5 - Episode 5 - Kill the Boy (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-5---Kill-the-Boy-1.html"/><updated>2016-07-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-5---Kill-the-Boy-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-5---Kill-the-Boy-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 5 - Episode 5 - Kill the Boy (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/07/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">Dany's decisions are very strange in this episode. She is in a
very rough place. It is very interesting that Maester Aemon has
such feelings for Dany, whom he has never met and has no ability
to contact. I love Jon's plan and his integrity to it, but it is
very sad that no one else understands, even the people that have
seen the undead army. It is very interesting that there's tons of
dragonglass on Dragonstone. Myranda is so creepy and weird, just
like Ramsay, who is super super awkward. I really enjoyed the
poem about the Doom of Valyria. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 5 - Episode 6 - Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-6---Unbowed--Unbent--Unbroken-1.html"/><updated>2016-07-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-6---Unbowed--Unbent--Unbroken-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/07/25/Game-of-Thrones---Season-5---Episode-6---Unbowed--Unbent--Unbroken-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 5 - Episode 6 - Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/07/">07</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/07/25/">25</a></span></span><pre class="content">It is very interesting and cool how Arya is learning to play "the
game of faces". I'm not totally sure what she is learning here
and I wish it would move faster. I love the little connections in
the social network of the characters, such as Tyrion bringing
news of Jorah's father. Jaime's escapade seems pretty
pointless. Baelish's scheme with Cersei is so sneaky. I'm very
surprised that the Tyrells are both now in jail. Ramsay is so
terrible. I like that Cersei really is just mindlessly scratching
the paper, because she drops the pen at the end. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry></feed>
