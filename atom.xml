It is a very
natural way that she becomes independent and starts off her own
journey. Varys is such a complicated guy, but I suppose that my
problem is that I'm looking for heroes. It is really epic the way
the hordes of ravens leave Winterfell. It's interesting that
there is another occurrence of a White Walker. Dany's made such a
huge mistake in this episode that is going to totally change
everything about her life. In many ways, it's similar to the
problems she will cause for herself in Slaver's Bay: disrupting
the old ways caused problems. Joffrey is such a little punk.

I was very curious about why Alliser is such a jerk to Jon
Snow. Apparently the novels reveal that he was a Targaryen
supporter that was forced to the Wall after Robert's Rebellion.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 9 - Baelor (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-9---Baelor-1.html"/><updated>2016-06-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-9---Baelor-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-9---Baelor-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 9 - Baelor (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/06/">06</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/06/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">Frey is such a creeper.

related his experience to Jon. Shae is very cute with
Tyrion. Tyrion's story about his marriage was very sad. It is
very neat that Jaime is now captured. It is very cool how
Eddard's first thought it how to protect Arya. In yet another
tragic moment, if only Eddard would have chosen honor at this
moment, he could have caused problems for the Lannisters and
eventually helped Robb as he was going to die anyway. My wife was
totally surprised by Ned dying. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 10 - Fire and Blood (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-10---Fire-and-Blood-1.html"/><updated>2016-06-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-10---Fire-and-Blood-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/06/23/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-10---Fire-and-Blood-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 10 - Fire and Blood (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/06/">06</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/06/23/">23</a></span></span><pre class="content">Arya's story is getting very interesting.

very exciting to wonder what Tyrion will do as Hand. The scene
with Ros and Pycelle was so weird. I really liked the
conversation between *REDACTED*t and Snow, as it does a great job
reminding us about what is really at stake. Dragons!

From the wiki... it is interesting to know that it has only been
300 years since the North was not independent. It's interesting
to learn that Varys was who arranged for Yaren to help Arya,
Gendry, and Ned. </pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 7 - You Win or You Die (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/22/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-7---You-Win-or-You-Die-1.html"/><updated>2016-06-22T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/22/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-7---You-Win-or-You-Die-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/06/22/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-7---You-Win-or-You-Die-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 7 - You Win or You Die (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/06/">06</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/06/22/">22</a></span></span><pre class="content">Cersei is so much colder than Eddard. It is interesting because
what happened with Bronn in the last episode foreshadowed this:
the one that fought with honor died. Eddard is such a tragic
hero, because he is doing the right thing but will not
win. Jorah's actions were great. Jon's realization that the world
is unfair is turning point for his character. The Night Watch's
oath is epic. Drogo's promise is great. It seems amazing that
Littlefinger betrayed Eddard, but I think it represents his
survival instinct against the Lannisters. He will fight them in
his own way later. Also, he loves Catelyn, not Eddard.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/TV Shows/">TV Shows</a></li><li><a href="/cat/Game of Thrones/">Game of Thrones</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 4 - Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things (2)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/21/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-4---Cripples--Bastards--and-Broken-Things-1.html"/><updated>2016-06-21T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/21/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-4---Cripples--Bastards--and-Broken-Things-1.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/06/21/Game-of-Thrones---Season-1---Episode-4---Cripples--Bastards--and-Broken-Things-1.html">Game of Thrones - Season 1 - Episode 4 - Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things (2)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/06/">06</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/06/21/">21</a></span></span><pre class="content">It was a pretty epic moment when Dany realized that Viserys was

I like the way the CIA people came
around to respect the soldiers protecting them. I really liked the
last line of "I don't know how you guys made it last night, but I
know how we did" and "I'm proud to know Americans like you."

It is a conflicting experience, watching this. I'm totally opposed
to the US being involved in things like this, but I have great
respect and admiration for the soldiers. My perspective is that the
CIA and politicians that send them around the world are terrible,
but that they are great.</pre><ul class="categories"><li><a href="/cat/Movies/">Movies</a></li><li><a href="/cat/2016/">2016</a></li></ul></div>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html"><![CDATA[Movie: Children of Men, starring Clive Owen (2006)]]></title><link href="http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/13/Movie--Children-of-Men--starring-Clive-Owen--2006--0.html"/><updated>2016-06-13T00:00:00-00:00</updated><id>http://MECHAkunEX.github.com/post/2016/06/13/Movie--Children-of-Men--starring-Clive-Owen--2006--0.html</id><content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="post"><span class="title"><a href="/posts/2016/06/13/Movie--Children-of-Men--starring-Clive-Owen--2006--0.html">Movie: Children of Men, starring Clive Owen (2006)</a></span><span class="date"><span class="year"><a href="/archive/2016/">2016</a></span><span class="month"><a href="/archive/2016/06/">06</a></span><span class="day"><a href="/archive/2016/06/13/">13</a></span></span><pre class="content">This was a very weird movie.
