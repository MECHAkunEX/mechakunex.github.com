the game. I went through the Catacombs and then to the final
boss. I beat the Pinwheel boss and Nito on my first try. After I
got back to the Firelink Shrine, it took me a long time to figure
out that I just needed to jump down the pit to get back to the
Lordvessel. I did it the first time very nervously. I fought the
boss once and got creamed, then did a few of the upgrades I could
on my gear and then went back and beat him on my second try. After
I watched the ending, I had a big&#8230; that was it? Just explode
into the flame?</p>

<p>&#8211; Review &#8211;</p>

<p>This is a great game. The combat is fun and challenging. The world
is interesting and detailed. It&#8217;s exactly like Demon&#8217;s Souls, but
better. Read my review about that game for more gushing. At this
point, I think I can only really think about what sets it apart
from Demon&#8217;s Souls.</p>

<p>I think the graphics were improved in that invisible technical
way. The environments feel like they could&#8217;ve been in the last
game and some of them seem incredibly close. Whatever graphical
upgrades they made aren&#8217;t a significant reasons to play this
versus the older one.</p>

<p>The story of the game is worse, in a sense. I honestly had no clue
what the point of the adventure was. I&#8217;m undead, there&#8217;s a king, I
need to get as strong as him, to beat him, and do what? After
reading the wiki Lore page, I still don&#8217;t really understand what I
did in the game. In contrast, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls story was very
coherent.</p>

<p>The world of the game is better though. The world seems much more
real because it&#8217;s all interconnected. It&#8217;s very exhilarating to
see a place from many different angles and get there. In contrast,
in the previous game, it felt incredibly &#8220;level&#8221;-y.</p>

<p>I think the difficulty of the game is pretty much identical to its
predecessor, in a sense. I felt like I never really had to learn
new strategies against what I already knew from Demon&#8217;s. There
were a few tough bosses, but only one that was really a wall: the
dual bosses in Anor Londo. I enjoyed the combat a lot, but I don&#8217;t
think it really evolved that much.</p>

<p>The way that the game is more difficult, however, is in the
numbers game. In the last game I never upgraded my weapons at all
and didn&#8217;t even really go out of my way to get particular
stuff. In this game, I got the strongest armor in the game and got
incredibly powerful weapons. Until then, I got reasonable stuff
and the game was a challenge, but not impossible. Afterward, it
felt almost the same actually, although I started getting through
the bosses in one or two tries versus four or five. But, I felt
like I did less grinding in this game than the last&#8230; maybe I
just found a better farming spot.</p>

<p>The other more difficult thing in this game were the precarious
environments that I fell off a lot. There was really only one
place like that in Demon&#8217;s, but I felt like Dark has a ton. Other
than these, I felt like the game had much fewer frustrating
moments and really not that many at all. I don&#8217;t really find the
game that difficult&#8230; just a good challenge&#8230; like Mega Man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised about my statistics on the game. I ended up
two levels LOWER than Demon&#8217;s. I spent about twenty MORE hours. I
spent 19 days over the course of about six weeks&#8212;about the same
amount of total days, I think.</p>

<p>Overall, I loved the game. But, I won&#8217;t be doing New Game+. I
played the last game about a year ago and I could imagine playing
a game like this in another year. I&#8217;d really like to figure out
how to make a game like this in 2D.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like the idea of the bargain between District 13 and the Capitol.</p>

<p>The militarism of District 13 is fascinating and reasonable, given
their past.</p>

<p>The books have always been a thin allegory for violence in media,
but having Katniss literally be a movie star is a bit
ridiculous. I&#8217;m glad that the characters realize this
too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny because when she&#8217;s in the field, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s in the
Games again, but the cameras are now obvious rather than hidden
everywhere.</p>

<p>The real moment of Katniss&#8217; catch phrase is totally epic. A little
teary.</p>

<p>The propaganda war is pretty brilliant and fits really well with
the media theme of the books.</p>

<p>I find the term &#8220;Mockingjay&#8221; used for Katniss incredibly silly and
aggravating.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; impassioned speech before she gets shot. :)</p>

<p>I have to admit, turning the raid on the Capitol into a recreation
of the Games is a clever way to stick to the formula.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m stopping for the day right when Peeta shows up in the
Capitol&#8230; tense!</p>

Duke&#8217;s Archive and through the Lost Izalith. The Bed of Chaos boss
was tricky to get the jump right. Other than that, I found most of
the bosses hard, but definitely do-able. I think I beat all the in
between ones on my second try. This final part of the game is
pretty good&#8230; still hard because you&#8217;ve got to learn the area,
but I never need to really change my equipment or stats up&#8230;
it&#8217;s all back on my playing. I think I will be able to beat the
game tomorrow&#8230; just one more Lord Soul and then the final boss.</p>

<p>I &#8220;love&#8221; seeing the shadows of enemies from below them or through
walls.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea that the Muttations are really the tributes is
fascinating. The magic technology of the capital is pretty
interesting overall.</p>

<p>I finished the book today. As I said the other day, I find it to be
almost perfectly captured in the movie. That disappoints me a
little because I was hoping to learn more about the world from the
book.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how the other books could continue the style of
this one. The story can definitely move, there&#8217;s no doubt about
that, but I&#8217;m not convinced that Collins could write a political
thriller.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first chapters do a really good job of easily recapping what
happened in the last book as a reminder.</p>

<p>The concept of the Quarter Quell is so contrived for plot
purposes. It&#8217;s as bad as Harry Potter where every year some huge
thing is revealed that couldn&#8217;t possibly have been realistically
unmentioned before.</p>

<p>I thought that the tour around the districts would be a contrived
way to give the reader a tour. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>I teared up in the District 11 scene.</p>

<p>Wow, how contrived to get Katniss back in the arena, because
Collins has written her into a state of inability to do
anything. Naturally it will be her and Peeta again?</p>

<p>It is interesting that Katniss will have an advantage the second
time, because she and Peeta will the youngest, and presumably
un-softened by living in luxury as a victor.</p>

<p>Haymitch&#8217;s story is great.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;food porn&#8221; in the books never gets old, strangely.</p>

<p>Katniss&#8217; private session with the Gamemakers :)</p>

<p>The pre-Games interviews were amazing.</p>

<p>The end of Part II is waaaay intense.</p>

<p>I feel like throughout the book Collins uses such sterile and bland
language to talk about Katniss&#8217; body. Yet, she seems to always be
doing it. We often hear about the showers and baths that Katniss
takes and when that happens she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s &#8220;naked&#8221; or talk about
her &#8220;breasts&#8221; and most often she mentions her &#8220;underwear&#8221;,
&#8220;underclothes&#8221;, or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;. It&#8217;s particularly strange how
bland it is given the food orgies and descriptions of the Capitol
fashion we&#8217;re so often given.</p>

<p>The whole second book is reminiscent of bad movie sequel that was
summarized in the production notes with one word: MORE. More
violence. More romance. More intrigue. More food. More. The book
has almost an identical structure and plot, but again, and a little
bit different, but bigger. Yet, it does a good job at it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m disappointed the movie didn&#8217;t use the plot-point about the
&#8220;traitor&#8221; that Katniss saw in the woods that time. It&#8217;s a cool
idea.</p>

<p>I find there to be a lot more making out and conflict in Katniss
about Peeta in the book than the movie. But both are incredibly
sterile&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine the audience really being excited about
it.</p>

<p>Another point where the movie exceeds the book is that it shows
people outside the Arena reacting. It&#8217;s very interesting. Collins
tries to do that by having Katniss imagine things, but it
definitely isn&#8217;t as touching.</p>

they were very proud of their accomplishments and built their lives

the games that made them &#8220;famous&#8221; or in future games. It seemed so
stagnant. Most of the guys seemed to live really depressing lives

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the first five chapters of this. The writing is quite better
than the Twilight series. Katniss has a strong voice that can pull
the story along well and keep your attention. The world is very
interesting, with not enough detail, but perhaps just enough.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that if the Capitol is &#8220;surrounded&#8221; by the
12 districts, and it is in the Rockies, but District 12 is in
Appalachia&#8230; i.e. very far away&#8230; how is it that only eight
thousand people live there and can all gather together in a single
public square? District 12 is the size of a small town in modern
America. It strains credulity to think that the world is so
sparsely populated and this place with so few people can really
have major starvation problems, but not be totally decimated by
them.</p>

<p>Katniss did say that there were some severe natural disasters at
some point in the past (at least 74 years) that led to the world
being like this, and at this point no information has been given
about the size of other districts, but I find it very difficult to
believe at this point.</p>

getting enough money to buy the Giant Armor and Havel&#8217;s Ring. Then
I realized that if I wanted to upgrade the armor all the way, I&#8217;d
need a lot of Twinkling shards, that were only sold by the guy I
was planning on killing. After a little while grinding souls to
buy the shards, I decided to check out Ash Lake where I could find
an enemy that dropped them. Unfortunately, it was a major pain to
get down the Great Hollow, plus the Black Hydra was really tough
(and I couldn&#8217;t kill him&#8230;). When I finally go there, I only
managed to get 2 drops in an amount of time I probably could have
got enough souls to buy four or five. So I decided to
leave&#8230; which took a lot of time to exit the Great Hollow. It was
a major pain&#8230; and a major mistake to go down there. I think I&#8217;ll
grind for souls and just buy them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for an hour and a half today. I got to my goal stats and
then got a ton (60!) fire buff items. I went against the bosses
with Iaito + flame, but was totally creamed. Ouch. I&#8217;m wondering
what weapons I should try now. I think I will get Havel&#8217;s Ring and
the Giant Blacksmith Hammer and go from there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played for about two hours tonight. I fought the Hydra and
boosted some levels, plus I found a new armor setup. I went to
fight the double bosses in Londo, but died both times I tried. The
second time, I got Ornstein down to one more hit before death. :(
I think I will try to upgrade my weapon to fire element&#8230; which
will be a bit of a trek.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a totally over the top movie. It&#8217;s silly, kind of stupid,
but fun at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some funny moments and characters&#8212;like the way the CIA
teams act on the &#8220;case&#8221; and Lauren&#8217;s friend Trish. The action
scenes are of the &#8220;super fast&#8221; type without much impact.</p>

<p>There a few moments of real romance&#8212;when FDR takes Lauren home or
when he&#8217;s watching Titantic and the look on Tuck&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s face
at the end. The main problem with the romantic plot is that
everyone is being so dishonest with each other, there&#8217;s no meaning
behind their actions.</p>

<p>But overall, I feel like a lot of the actors aren&#8217;t really acting
together, just in the same room. It feels very
forced. (Particularly Trish actually, she&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t look at Lauren
enough when they&#8217;re talking&#8230; it&#8217;s very unnatural.)</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon looks really good in the movie. However,
sometimes it feels like she&#8217;s trying too hard to look
sexy&#8230; particularly in the sex scene with FDR. The way the
characters are connect to each other&#8230; it&#8217;s like ballroom dancing
where FDR is the frame to show off her legs and stomach. Yet
another example of the unnaturalness in the movie.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played through the rest of the Darkroot Forest and killed the
boss and got some awesome equipment. At first when I tried to get
Pharis&#8217; bow, he fell off the cliff and so I didn&#8217;t get it. But
later I reversed my hollowing and there was a flame where Pharis
used to be, so I got his stuff. Awesome! My stats are now a lot
higher because of the ring.</p>
