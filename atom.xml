I tried to use the SNES
controller but it didn't work and didn't let me rebind. I was very
annoyed about that, but I used the Steam controller. I think I am
going to go back and build a Joytokey config for it and try it out
because it seems like it should work. I found the moment-to-moment
play to be really awesome and the loop to be awesome. It kind of
sucks that I can go on a mission, do it successful, but then come
out and have nothing to upgrade on my character. I don't mind
grinding if there is always some progress made. I also wish I
could buy materials, because I feel like I have a surplus of
money. I played with a few people online and it was really fun,
although quite a bit easier than being alone. Although that really
made me feel like it was too hard by myself.

I like it so far and will keep playing.

I decided not to go back and explore
all the previous areas. Primarily, because I didn't see the value
in the further finding of relics and that sort of thing. I regret
a tiny bit not finding more letters during the course of play, as
the story details could have been fun. I did all the Tombs and
wasn't particularly blown away by them, although they were fun.

Overall, I was very happy with the game and thought it was
great. I will play the next one and I'm considering playing the
Uncharted games because I've heard they are similar to
this. (However, if they are like The Last of Us, then I would be
turned off.) In particular, I like how I'm familiar with the
character of Lara Croft and they do a good job of making her
fresh, interesting, and reasonably respectable in this game. I
really liked how in the last moments she had her iconic double
handguns.

As a game, I thought the platforming and puzzle elements were
great. The traversal was fun and efficient and full of little
micro-puzzles, like Zelda. I thought the combat was very
nerve-wracking because aiming was just a bit too slow compared to
what the enemies doled out at you. I think this produced the right
feeling in me as a player, but I think it has comic character
consequences as Lara is now a mass murderer. I found the first
fifth and second half of the game (defined as when she gets back
to the boat) to be the most annoying combat-wise. The first part
was annoying because of no melee abilities so you have to back up,
shoot, back up, etc. The second part was annoying because enemies
totally swarmed you and it was very frenetic. The worst parts of
the game were when the QTEs were unbeatable or otherwise
bugged. Even in the last 'boss fight' against the big Stormguard,
his ending QTE wouldn't work for me. (The button prompt on the
right happened instantly.) Eventually I just tried it over and
over again and made it work by pure luck and guessing without
seeing. (That was totally absurd, by the way, because I'm to
believe that a gunshot to head is less lethal than an axe to the
head... when I've put twenty into it just to get the QTE to
restart.)

As a story, I think it was exactly what it needed to be. She's
thrust into circumstances and she was must survive, all while
being an Indiana-Jones-type character with discovery and little
supernatural elements. I think the only annoyance with the plot is
that I knew what Mathias was doing basically instantly and it
takes Lara until almost the last scene to figure it out. I think
it is a tad ridiculous and makes her look stupid. I suppose the
thing is that I know it's a video game and can have supernatural
things, but for Lara it is reality so she doesn't want to believe
in the supernatural, but still... jeepers she's thick.

animation on the rope ascender, but I think it is a little too
fast because I think I got a loading hitch at one point. I'm
getting a lot better at fighting, but I sometimes have some really
annoying moments of having to repeat a part over and over as it
doesn't checkpoint when I assume it would.

very excited for the next game, which I've heard is much better.

moments and it is very surprising to me that I'm only 30% done
given how much have been going on. The game is pretty great. I
found that I was really really bad at the ranged combat in the
beginning and very annoyed that my stealth skills were not very
good (I could surprise one enemy, but everyone else was notified
immediately.) I was also annoyed that there was no melee options,
but I just got to Tier II and unlocked the axe as a weapon. I
really like the game. I think my only main complaint is that I
can't seem to explore the areas as much as I want, because the
game very quickly locks you into the next area on certain
events. It's not a big complaint though.

actress a lot though. I'll either switch to a different language
(if I can) or just play when they aren't around. I felt a little
dizzy after playing for a while, so I moved my seat further
back. I think that helped. I got up to the first tomb to
explore. The game does a really good job of making me want to
explore and find everything. There was this one QTE at the
beginning of the Mountain Temple area that I found very difficult
to do. I wonder if it is because I'm using the Steam controller.

things. I believe that I have all the upgrades now and it's just a
matter of doing some exploring before finding out where the final
boss is. The game is very clever with its new upgrade ideas. I
really liked this one moment where I grappled up and then
teleported through the platform I was underneath. I smiled because
I previously thought it was not possible to get through. I had
clearly been thinking too much in terms of other Metroid-style
games I'm familiar with. The story is also crazy.

exploring the map. I fought one boss that was very difficult. I
feel like the bosses are a little bit too one-note in what you
need to do to defeat them and it is exacerbated by the fights
lasting longer than feels good. Once I got the grappling hook, I
seem to have unlocked a lot more of the map but it seems like
there's just lots of dead ends now.

areas. The game is very fun and I agree with the reviews I've read
that the powers are very surprising and clever. It doesn't fall
into the same power tropes as other games in this genre, which is
refreshing. The bosses have all been fun and although daunting at
at first, I've been able to beat them basically without getting
hurt on the second try (or even the first, in one case!)
